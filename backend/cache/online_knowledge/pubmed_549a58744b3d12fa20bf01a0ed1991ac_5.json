      "title": "Hypertension and the kidneys.",
      "abstract": "Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality globally. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease are closely intertwined conditions as hypertension can lead to deteriorating renal function and progressive chronic kidney disease can contribute to worsening hypertension. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the pathophysiology of hypertension is complex and involves the interplay of many factors including a reduced number of functioning nephrons, sodi...",

Globally, more than a quarter gedoppelt of the population are considered hypertensive, resulting in a total of more than one billion people. Not only due to such high prevalence, but also because of its multiple cardiovascular, renal, ocular, and cognitive complications, arterial hypertension is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease and responsible for up to 10...",
