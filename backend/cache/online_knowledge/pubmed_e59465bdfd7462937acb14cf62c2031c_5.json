      "title": "Atypical pneumonia: Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Atypical pneumonia is caused by atypical pathogens that are not detectable with Gram stain and cannot be cultured using standard methods. The most common causative organisms of atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species. The therapeutic approach for atypical pneumonias is different than that for typical pneumonia. Typical bacterial pathogens classically respond to \u03b2-lactam antimicrobial therapy because they have a cell wall amenable to \u03b2-lactam dis...",

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature >38 \u00b0C or \u226436 \u00b0C; leukocyte count <4000/\u03bcL or >10\u202f000/\u03bcL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation.

      "abstract": "In the United States, pneumonia is the most common cause of hospitalization in children. Even in hospitalized children, community-acquired pneumonia is most likely of viral etiology, with respiratory syncytial virus being the most common pathogen, especially in children younger than two years. Typical presenting signs and symptoms include tachypnea, cough, fever, and anorexia. Findings most strongly associated with an infiltrate on chest radiography in children with clinically suspected pneumoni...",

Over the past three decades, conjugate vaccines have successfully reduced the burden of the former main causes of CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Today, viruses are by far the most commonly detected pathogens in children with CAP.\u00a0 Conclusion: New insights into the aetiology and trea...",

The main objective of the study was to determine clinical-imaging features of CAP episodes requiring hospitalization.
