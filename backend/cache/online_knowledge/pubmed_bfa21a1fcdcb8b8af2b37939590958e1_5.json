HL is composed of two distinct disease entities: classical HL and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (also called nodular lymphocyte predominant B-cell lymphoma). Nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depletion, and lymphocyte-rich HL are subgroups of classical HL. An accurate assessment of the stage of disease in patients wit...",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency that is characterised by prolonged or recurrent seizures without recovery between episodes and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and targeted therapy can reduce the risk of complications and death associated with status epilepticus, thereby improving outcomes. The most recent International League Against Epilepsy definition considers two important timepoints in status epilepticus: first, when the seizure ...",

Professional societies have recommended insulin therapy as the cornerstone of inpatient pharmacological management. Intravenous insulin therapy is the treatment of choice in the critical care setting. In non-intensive care settings, several insulin protocols have been proposed to manage patients with hyperglycaemia; however, meta-an...",
