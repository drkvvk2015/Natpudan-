Causes are often multifactorial:\nIntrinsic: Typically osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis, but remember fractured neck \nof femur, CNS disease, \ue001 vision, cognitive impairment, depression, postural hypoten-\nsion, periph eral neuropathy, medication (eg antihypertensives, sedatives), pain, \neg arthritis, parkinsonism (eg drugs: prochlorperazine, neuroleptics, metoclopra-\nmide), muscle weakness (consider vitamin D de\ufb01 ciency), incontinence, UTI, pneu-\nmonia, anaemia, hypothyroidism, renal impairment, hypothermia, and alcohol.\nEnviron ment: Poor lighting, uneven walking surface. Treatment includes address-\ning injuries, reducing risk factors, and reducing the risk of injury, eg treat osteopo-\nrosis (p682). A multidisciplinary multifactorial approach alongside occupational \ntherapists and physiotherapists is likely to be bene\ufb01 cial. See gait disorders, p467.\nIf there is ataxia, the cause is not always alcohol: other chemicals may be involved \n(eg cannabis or prescribed sedatives). There may be a metastatic or non-meta-\nstatic manifestation of malignancy, or a cerebellar lesion.\n\ue007Bilateral weak legs may suggest a cord lesion: see p466. If there is associated \nurinary or faecal incontinence \u00b1 saddle anaesthesia or lower limb sensory loss, \nurgent imaging (MRI) and treatment for cord compression may well be needed.\n\u2018Off -legs\u2019\u2014falls and diffi  culty walking\nItching (pruritus) Common and, if chronic, most unpleasant.\nTable 2.1 Aetiology of pruritus\nLocal causes\nSystemic (do FBC, ESR, glucose, LFT, U&E, ferritin, TFT)\nEczema, atopy, urticaria\nLiver disease (bile salts, eg PBC)\nOld age; pregnancy\nScabies\nUraemia (eg CKD)\nDrugs (eg morphine)\nLichen planus\nMalignancy (eg lymphoma)\nDiabetes mellitus\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nPolycythaemia rubra vera\nThyroid disease\nSpinal cord tumours (rare)2\nIron de\ufb01 ciency anaemia\nHIV infection\nQuestions: Wheals (urticaria)?

Exposure, eg to ani-\nmals (atopy?) or \ufb01 bre glass (irritant eczema?).\nSee table 2.1. Look for local causes: Scabies burrows in \ufb01 nger webs, lice on hair \nshafts, knee and elbow blisters (dermatitis herpetiformis). Systemic: Splenomeg-\naly, nodes, jaundice, \ufb02 ushed face, or thyroid signs? \ue057: Treat causes; try soothing \nbland emollients \u00b1 emollient bath oils \u00b1 sedative antihistamines at night, eg chlor-\nphenamine 4mg PO.\nItch\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are features which patients report. Physical signs are elicited at the \nbedside. Together, they constitute the features of the condition in that patient. \nTheir evolution over time and interaction with the physical, psychological, and social \nspheres comprise the natural history of any disease. Throughout this chapter, we \ndiscuss symptoms in isolation and attempt to classify them into a \u2018system\u2019 or present \nthem in the following BOXES as \u2018non-speci\ufb01 c\u2019. This is unnatural but a good \ufb01 rst step in \nlearning how to diagnose. All doctors have to know about symptoms and their relief. \nPart of becoming a good doctor is learning to link symptoms together, to identify \nthose that may be normal, and those that are worrying. There are many online tools \nand books that can help with this, but there is no substitute for experience. If you \naren\u2019t sure, ask a specialist in that area for advice.\nThe following are common \u2018non-speci\ufb01 c\u2019 presentations.", "text_length": 3570, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 40/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 39, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.925761", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.926483", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
