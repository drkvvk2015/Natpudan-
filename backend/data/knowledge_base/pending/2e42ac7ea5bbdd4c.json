Then (see \ufb01 g 3.3):\n  \n\u2022 Rate: At usual speed (25mm/s) each \u2018big square\u2019 is 0.2s; each \u2018small square\u2019 is 0.04s. \nTo calculate the rate, divide 300 by the number of big squares between two con-\nsecutive R waves (table 3.1). The normal rate is 60\u2013100bpm.\n  \n\u2022 Rhythm: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the \u2018card method\u2019: lay a card along \nthe ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card to and fro to \ncheck that all intervals are equal. If they are not, note if:\n  \n\u2022 there is slight but regular lengthening and then shortening (with respiration)\u2014\nsinus arrhythmia, common in the young\n  \n\u2022 there are diff erent rates which are multiples of each other\u2014varying block\n  \n\u2022 it is 100% irregular\u2014atrial \ufb01 brillation (AF) or ventricular \ufb01 bril lation (VF).\nSinus rhythm is characterized by a P wave followed by a QRS complex. AF has no dis-\ncernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular. Atrial \ufb02 utter (p130, \ufb01 g \n3.35 p131) has a \u2018sawtooth\u2019 baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular \nQRS complexes. Ventricular rhythm has QRS complexes >0.12s with P waves follow-\ning them or absent (\ufb01 g 3.12, p106).\n  \n\u2022 Axis: The overall direction of depolarization across the patient\u2019s anterior chest; this \nis the sum of all the ventricular electrical forces during ventricular depolarization. \nSee BOX \u2018Determining the ECG axis\u2019. Left axis deviation can result from left anterior \nhemiblock, inferior MI, VT from a left ventricular focus, WPW, LVH. Right axis devia-\ntion can result from RVH, PE, anterolateral MI, WPW and left posterior hemiblock.\n  \n\u2022 P wave: Normally precedes each QRS complex, and upright in II, III, & aVF but invert-\ned in aVR. Absent P wave: AF, P hidden due to junctional or ventricular rhythm. P mi-\ntrale: bi\ufb01 d P wave, indicates left atrial hypertrophy. P pulmonale: peaked P wave, \nindicates right atrial hyper trophy. Pseudo-P-pulmonale seen if \ue000K\n+.\n  \n\u2022 PR interval: Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS. Normal range: 0.12\u20130.2s \n(3\u20135 small squares). A prolonged PR interval implies delayed AV conduction (1st \ndegree heart block). A short PR interval implies unusually fast AV conduction down \nan accessory pathway, eg WPW (see \ufb01 g 3.37, p133). See heart block, p98.\n  \n\u2022 QRS complex: See \ufb01 g 3.2. Normal duration: <0.12s. QRS >0.12s suggests ventricular \nconduction defects, eg a bundle branch block (pp99, 100), metabolic disturbance, or \nventricular origin (eg ventricular ectopic). High-amplitude QRS complexes suggest \nventricular hypertrophy (p100). Normal Q waves are <0.04s wide and <2mm deep; \nthey are often seen in leads I , aVL , V5, and V6 and re\ufb02 ect normal septal depolariza-\ntion. Pathological Q waves (deep and wide) may occur within a few hours of an \nacute MI.\n  \n\u2022 QT interval: Measure from start of QRS to end of T wave. It varies with rate. The \ncorrected QT interval (QTc) is the QT interval divided by the square root of the R\u2013R \ninterval, ie QTc=QT/\u221aRR. Normal QTc: 0.38\u20130.42s. For causes of prolonged QT interval \nsee p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death.\n  \u2022 ST segment: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usu-\nally implies infarction (p119, \ufb01 gs 3.9, 3.10, pp103\u20134) or ischaemia, respectively.\n  \n\u2022 T wave: Normally inverted in aVR, V1, and occasionally V2. Normal if inverted in isola-\ntion in lead III. Abnormal if inverted in I, II, and V4\u2013V6. Peaked in hyperkalaemia (\ufb01 g \n14.4, p675) and \ufb02 attened in hypokalaemia.\n  \n\u2022 J wave: See p849. The J point is where the S wave \ufb01 nishes and ST segment starts. A \nJ wave is a notch at this point. Seen in hypothermia, SAH, and \ue000Ca\n2+.\nFig 3.2 \u2018QRS\u2019 complexes. If the \ufb01 rst de\ufb02 ection from the isoelectric line is negative, it is a Q wave. \nAny positive de\ufb02 ection is an R wave. Any negative de\ufb02 ection after an R is an S. \nR\nR\nR\nR'\nS\nS\nQ S\nR\nR\nQ\nQ S", "text_length": 4047, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 108/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 107, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.045453", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.046170", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
