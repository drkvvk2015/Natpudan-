Antigenic shift occurs through mixing of human\ninfluenza A and animal (e.g. pig, bird) influenza A\nvirus genes to create a new human influenza A sub\ntype through a process called genetic reassortment\n(e.g. swine flu, avian flu). Rarely, avian strains of\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY (CONT\u2019D)\ninfluenza may directly infect humans.
