Hypotension, bronchospasm, and laryngeal\nedema may accompany the rash. Immune complex\nmediated reactions usually occur within 12 36 h of\ndrug exposure in a sensitized individual. Common\noffenders are penicillins and immunoglobulins. Non\nallergic forms of urticaria and angioedema occur\nfrom drug induced bradykinin release and/or mast\ncell degranulation.
