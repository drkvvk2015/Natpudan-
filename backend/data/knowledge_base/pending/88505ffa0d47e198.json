Check its date. And remember:\n  \n\u2022 Practice makes perfect\u2014always look at the image before checking the report, \nlearning how to distinguish normal from abnormal.\n  \n\u2022 Understand how the scan is done\u2014this makes interpretation easier and helps \nyou appreciate which scan will give the answer you need. It also gives practical \nclues to the result\u2014eg a routine CXR is performed in the postero-anterior (PA) \ndirection (the source posterior to the patient to minimize the cardiac shadow).\n  \n\u2022 Use a systematic approach\u2014so that you don\u2019t miss subtleties.\n  \n\u2022 Understand your anatomy\u2014virtually all investigations yield a 2D image from a \n3D structure. An understanding of anatomical relationships of the area in ques-\ntion will help reconstruct the images in your mind.\n  \n\u2022 Orientation\u2014for axial cross-sectional imaging this is as if you are looking up at \nthe supine patient \ue007from the feet. For images with non-conventional orienta-\ntions (eg MRCP) look on the image for clue markings, or rely on your knowledge of \nanatomy\u2014it can be tricky to visualize oblique sections!\n  \n\u2022 Remember the patient\u2014an investigation is only one part of the clinical work-up, \ndon\u2019t rely solely on the investigation result for your management decisions. Go \nback to see the patient after looking at the investigation and reading the radiolo-\ngist\u2019s report: you might notice something that you didn\u2019t before.\nInterpreting an image\nEveryone has their own method for presenting, and the right way is your own \nway. As long as you cover everything systematically\u2014because we all get \u2018hot-seat \namnesia\u2019 at some point\u2014the particulars will take care of themselves. Continue \nto polish your own method and remember a few extra tips for when an image is \npresented expectantly by your consultant/examiner and the \ufb02 oor is yours. A brief \nsilence with a thoughtful expression as you analyse the image is \ufb01 ne, then:\n  \n\u2022 State the written details: name, date of birth, where and how the imaging was \ntaken. Look for clues: weighting of an MRI, a \u2018+ c\u2019 indicating that contrast medium \nhas been used, the phase of the investigation (arterial/venous/portal), or even \nthe name of the organ printed on an ultrasound.\n  \n\u2022 State the type, mode, and technical quality of investigation\u2014not always easy!\nGoing through this list also gives you a bit of thinking time. Then:\n  \n\u2022 Start with life-threatening or very obvious abnormalities. Then be systematic:\n  \n\u2022 Is the patient\u2019s position adequate? Any lines, leads, or tubes? Note their position.\n  \n\u2022 Just like the bedside clues in a physical examination, there are clues in radiology \nexaminations. Note oxygen masks, ECG leads, venous access, infusion apparatus, \nand invasive devices. Identifying what they are also helps you to look through \nwhat may otherwise appear to be a cluttered mess.\n  \n\u2022 Note any abnormalities and try to contextualize these with whatever you al-\nready know of the patient. The abnormality may be hiding in plain sight, but if \nstruggling, step back and note any asymmetry or areas that just \u2018look diff erent\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 With cross-sectional imaging, scan through adjacent sections noting the anato-\nmy of one organ system or structure at a time (this may mean going up and down \nthrough a CT abdomen multiple times).\n  \n\u2022 Giving a diff erential diagnosis is good practice, as not all \ufb01 ndings are diagnostic.\n  \n\u2022 If there is additional clinical information that would help you to make a diagno-\nsis, don\u2019t be afraid to ask. After all, we treat patients and not images!\nRemember: \n\u2022X-ray=radiodensity (lucency/opacity). \u2022CT=attenuation.\n \n\u2022US=echogenicity. \n\u2022MRI=signal intensity.\nPresenting an image", "text_length": 3915, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 729/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 728, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.426752", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.427626", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
