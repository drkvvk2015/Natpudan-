Longer-term graft loss ~4%/year. \nFactors contributing to graft loss:\n  \n\u2022 Donor factors: age, comorbidity, living/deceased, DBD/DCD.\n  \n\u2022 Rejection.\n  \n\u2022 Infection.\n  \n\u2022 BP/CVD.\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent renal disease in graft.\nMost common outcome is death with a functioning transplant (ie transplant \u2018out-\nlives\u2019 the patient).\n1   Discuss everything with the local renal transplant unit: they will be happy to \nadvise, review, transfer, and follow-up any renal transplant recipient.\n2   What is the eGFR/creatinine? How does that compare with previous results? If \nyou do not have any, ask the transplant unit.\n3   Examine for and treat any reversible cause of AKI. Fluid state assessment \n(p300) is important\u2014if you are unsure, get expert help. Correction of volume \ndepletion and treatment of any sepsis should be prompt.\n4   Consider viral/opportunistic infections and atypical presentations due to im-\nmunosuppression, eg CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii.\n5   Do not stop any immunosuppressive medication.If the patient is unable to \ntolerate oral medication then immunosuppression must be given NG or convert \ned to an IV dose (conversion depends on drug: check with your pharmacist).\n6   Check for medication interactions: macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, \nclarithromycin) can cause calcineurin inhibitor toxicity.\n7   Dose all drugs according to renal function: penicillins, cephalosporins, amino-\nglycosides, insulin, opiates, and low-molecular-weight heparin.\n8   Check with the transplant unit before you give low-molecular-weight heparin \nfor VTE prophylaxis: they may want to do a transplant biopsy.\nWhen a patient with a renal transplant presents...\nIt feels good to be able to put pen to paper at last and to thank you from the bot-\ntom of my heart for the gift of life your daughter has given me and for the kindness \nand compassion you have shown.... I want to say to you that it was a wonderful \nthing that you did as a mother that in your deep sadness showed a caring and giv-\ning heart. I have a much better quality of life now since coming off  dialysis 5 years \nago. My father died of kidney failure when I was 3 years old. He was someone I \nwould have loved to have known. I often think about your daughter, who she was \nand what she was like. Despite not knowing her, I think about her with aff ection \nand much respect. These last years must have been extremely painful for you all. I \nreally hope that you, your family and friends have found peace in your lives.\nLove Deborah (renal transplant recipient, 1998)\nReproduced from: Royal College of Physicians, \nDepartment of Health, NHS Blood and Transplant. \nThank you for life: letters from transplant \nrecipients to donors' families.
