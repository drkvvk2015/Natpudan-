Special precautions \nare needed when there is an additional risk factor for thrombosis, eg surgery, preg-\nnancy, or enforced rest (see BOX for other risk factors). Only ~50% of patients with \nthrombosis and a +ve family history have an identi\ufb01 able thrombophilia on routine \ntests: others may have abnormalities that are as yet unidenti\ufb01 ed.\nInherited \u2022 Activated protein c (APC) resistance/factor V Leiden: Chief cause of in-\nherited thrombophilia. Present in ~5% of the population, although most will not de-\nvelop thrombosis. Usually associated with a single point mutation in factor V (factor \nV Leiden), so that this clotting factor is not broken down by APC. Risk of DVT or PE is \nraised 5-fold if heterozygous for the mutation (50-fold if homozygous). Thrombotic \nrisk is increased in pregnancy and those on oestrogens (OHCS p33, p257 & p303).\n\u2022 Prothrombin gene mutation: Causes high prothrombin levels and \ue000thrombosis \ndue to down-regulation of \ufb01 brinolysis, by thrombin-activated \ufb01 brinolysis inhibitor.\n\u2022 Protein C & S de\ufb01 ciency: These vitamin K-dependent factors act together to \ncleave and so neutralize factors V & VIII. Heterozygotes de\ufb01 cient for either protein \nrisk thrombosis. Skin necrosis also occurs (esp. if on warfarin). Homozygous de\ufb01 -\nciency for either protein causes neonatal purpura fulminans\u2014fatal, if untreated.\n\u2022 Antithrombin de\ufb01 ciency: Antithrombin is a co-factor of heparin, and inhibits \nthrombin. Less common, aff ects 1:500. Heterozygotes\u2019 thrombotic risk is greater \nthan protein C or S de\ufb01 ciency by ~4-fold. Homozygosity is incompatible with life.\nAcquired Causes: \u2022 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APL: p554)\u2014serum antiphospho-\nlipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant \u00b1 anticardiolipin antibody) predispose to ve-\nnous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss. In most it \nis a primary disease, but it is also seen in SLE. \u2022 Oral contraceptive pills/HRT (relative \nrisk 2\u20134; related to both oestrogen and progesterone content/type). \u2022 Any cause of \nthrombocytosis or polycythaemia may also cause thrombosis (p366).\nWhich tests? Ask the lab. Do FBC, \ufb01 lm, clotting (PT, thrombin time, APTT, \ufb01 brinogen) \n\u00b1 APC resistance test, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and assays \nfor antithrombin and proteins C & S de\ufb01 ciency (\u00b1 DNA analysis by PCR for the factor V \nLeiden mutation if APC resistance test is +ve, and for prothrombin gene mutation). \n\ue007These tests should ideally be done when the patient is well, not pregnant, and off  \nanticoagulation for 1 month.\nWho? Test those with: \u2022 arterial thrombosis or MI at <50yrs old (eg for APL)\n\u2022 unprovoked VTE (ie at <40yrs with no risk factors) \u2022 VTE with oral contraceptives/\npregnancy \u2022 unexplained recurrent VTE \u2022 unusual site, eg mesenteric or portal vein \nthrombosis \u2022 recurrent fetal loss (\u22653) \u2022 neonatal thrombosis.\nWho not? Those already on lifelong anticoagulation, 1st-degree relatives of peo-\nple with a history of DVT/PE or thrombophilia except in special circumstances. \n\ue007There is often no bene\ufb01 t to testing (ie no change to management), it is expensive \nand may cause signi\ufb01 cant worry to patients: be sparing in requesting these tests.\nTreatment Anticoagulate acute thrombosis (p350). If recurrence occurs with no \nother risk factors, consider lifelong anticoagulation. Recurrence whilst on treat-\nment should be treated by increasing treatment intensity (eg \ue000target INR to 3\u20134). \nIn antithrombin de\ufb01 ciency, high doses of heparin may be needed; liaise with a hae-\nmatologist. In protein C or S de\ufb01 ciency, monitor treatment closely as skin necrosis \nmay occur with warfarin.\nPrevention Lifelong anticoagulation is not needed in absence of VTE, but advise \nof \ue000risk with the oral contraceptive pill or HRT, and counsel as regards to the best \nform of contraception. Warn about other risk factors for VTE. Prophylaxis may be \nneeded in pregnancy, eg in antiphospholipid syndrome (get expert help: aspirin \nand, sometimes, prophylactic heparin are used as warfarin is teratogenic, see OHCS \np33). Prophylactic SC heparin may also be indicated in high-risk situations, eg pre-\nsurgery.", "text_length": 4370, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 382/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 381, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.826253", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.827168", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
