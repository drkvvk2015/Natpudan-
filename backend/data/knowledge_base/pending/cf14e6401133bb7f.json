Check the observation chart and dipstick urine.\n6 Abdomen\nInspection:\n  \n\u2022 Scars\u2014previous surgery, transplant, stoma\n  \n\u2022 Visible masses, hernias, or pulsation of AAA\n  \n\u2022 Visible veins suggesting portal hypertension\n  \n\u2022 Gynaecomastia, hair loss, acanthosis nigricans\nPalpation:\nSquat by the bed so that the patient\u2019s abdomen is at \nyour eye level. Ask if there is any pain and examine \nthis part last. Watch the patient\u2019s face for signs of \ndiscomfort. Palpate the entire abdomen (see p565):\n  \n\u2022 Light palpation\u2014if this elicits pain, check for re-\nbound tenderness. Any involuntary tension in mus-\ncles (\u2018guarding\u2019)? See p606.\n  \n\u2022 Deep palpation\u2014to detect masses.\n  \n\u2022 Liver\u2014using the radial border of the index \ufb01 nger \naligned with the costal margin start palpation from \nthe RIF. Press down and ask patient to take a deep \nbreath. Continue upwards towards the costal mar-\ngin until you feel the liver edge.\n  \n\u2022 Spleen\u2014start palpation in RIF and work towards \nthe left costal margin asking the patient to take a \ndeep breath in and feeling for edge of the spleen.\n  \n\u2022 Kidneys\u2014for each kidney: place one hand behind \npatient\u2019s loin, press down on the abdomen with \nyour other hand and \u2018ballot\u2019 the kidney up with your \nlower hand against your upper hand (\ufb01 g 2.30). Un-\nless slim or pathology present, may not be palpable.\n  \n\u2022 Aorta\u2014palpate midline above umbilicus, is it ex-\npansile? (\ufb01 g 2.49, p79).\nPercussion:\n  \n\u2022 Liver\u2014percuss to map upper & lower border of liver.\n  \n\u2022 Spleen\u2014percuss from border of spleen as palpat-\ned, around to mid-axillary line.\n  \n\u2022 Bladder\u2014if enlarged, suprapubic region will be dull.\n  \n\u2022 Ascites\u2014shifting dullness: percuss centrally to lat-\nerally until dull, keep your \ufb01 nger at the dull spot and \nask patient to lean onto opposite side. If the dull-\nness was \ufb02 uid, this will now have moved by gravity \nand the previously dull area will be resonant.\nAuscultation:\n  \n\u2022 Bowel sounds\u2014listen just below the umbilicus.\n  \n\u2022 Bruits\u2014listen over aorta and renal arteries (either \nside of midline above umbilicus).\nFig 2.30 Ballottement of the \nkidneys.\nReproduced from Thomas J, et al. \n(eds). Oxford Handbook of Clini-\ncal Examination and Practical \nSkills (2007), with permission from \nOxford University Press.\n  \n\u2022 If you think there is a spleen tip, roll the patient onto their right side and feel \nagain. This tips the spleen forward and allows you to percuss around to the back.\n  \n\u2022 Check the back for spider naevi, even if the chest appears clear (look for nephrec-\ntomy scars as you do this).\n  \n\u2022 Light palpation really should be light, to check for tenderness and very large \nmasses, watching the patient\u2019s face throughout.\n  \n\u2022 If you suspect voluntary guarding, use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to as-\nsist with palpation and distract the patient who will think you are auscultating!\nTop tips", "text_length": 3085, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 73/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 72, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.988268", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.989961", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
