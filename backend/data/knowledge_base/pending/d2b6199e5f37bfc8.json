Complaints of \u2018dizzy spells\u2019 are very common and are used by \npatients to describe many diff erent sensations. True vertigo is a hallucination of \nmovement, often rotatory, of the patient or their surroundings. In practice, simple \n\u2018spinning\u2019 is rare\u2014the \ufb02 oor may tilt, sink, or rise. The key to diagnosis is to \ufb01 nd out ex-\nactly what the patient means by \u2018dizzy:\u2019 if this is not vertigo or if atypical symptoms \nare present consider other causes, eg if there is loss of awareness, think of epilepsy \nor syncope; if there is faintness, lightheadedness, or palpitations, think of anaemia, \ndysrhythmia, anxiety, or hypotension.\nAssociated symptoms: Diffi  culty walking or standing (may fall suddenly to the \nground), relief on lying or sitting still (vertigo is almost always worsened by move-\nment); nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating. Associated hearing loss or tinnitus implies \nlabyrinth or VIIIth nerve involvement.\nCauses\nBenign positional vertigo: Occurs on head movement due to disruption of debris in the \nsemicircular canal of the ears (canalolithiasis). Fatiguable nystagmus on performing \nthe Hallpike manoeuvre is diagnostic; Epley manoeuvres clear the debris (OHCS p555).\nAcute labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis): Abrupt onset of severe vertigo, nausea, \nvomiting \u00b1 prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe \nvertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3\u20134wks. \ue057: reassure. Sedate.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease: Increased pressure in the endolymphatic system of the inner ear \ncauses recurrent attacks of vertigo lasting >20min, \ufb02 uctuating (or permanent) sen-\nsorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (with a sense of aural fullness \u00b1 falling to one \nside). \ue057: bed rest and reassurance in acute attacks. An antihistamine (eg cinnarizine) \nis useful if prolonged, or buccal prochlorperazine if severe, for up to 7d.\nOtotoxicity: Amino glycosides, loop diuretics, or cisplatin can cause deafness \u00b1 vertigo.\nAcoustic neuroma: (\ufb01 gs 10.12, 10.13) Doubly misnamed: it is a Schwannoma (not \nneuroma) arising from the vestibular (not auditory) nerve. They account for 80% \nof cerebellopontine angle tumours and often present with unilateral hearing loss, \nwith vertigo occurring later. Growth rate is slow (usually 1\u20132 mm/year) and can be \npredicted by serial MRIs. With progression, ipsilateral Vth , VIth , IXth , and Xth nerves \nmay be aff ected (also ipsilateral cerebellar signs). Signs of \ue000 ICP occur late, indicating \na large tumour. Commoner in \ue033 and neuro\ufb01 bromatosis (esp. NF2, p514).\nTraumatic damage: If trauma aff ects the petrous temporal bone or the cerebello-\npontine angle then the auditory nerve may be damaged, causing vertigo, deafness, \nand/or tinnitus.\nHerpes zoster: Herpetic eruption of the external auditory meatus; facial palsy \u00b1 deaf-\nness, tinnitus, and vertigo (Ramsay Hunt syndrome, see p501).\nOthers: Vertiginous epilepsy; MS; stroke/TIA; migraine; motion sickness; alcohol in-\ntoxication.", "text_length": 3082, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 470/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 469, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.979838", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.980612", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
