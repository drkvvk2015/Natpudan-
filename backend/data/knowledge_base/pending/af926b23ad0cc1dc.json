Transmission occurs through the bite of an \ninfected Anopheles mosquito. Only female mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium as only \nfemales require a blood meal for egg development. Transmission in the absence of \na mosquito is rare: vertical (congenital transfer from mother to child), transfusion, \norgan transplantation, needle-sharing.\nTable 9.19 Malaria species in humans\nSpecies\nAverage incuba-\ntion (range)\nPersistent \nliver stage Distribution\nP. falciparum \n(\ufb01 g 9.24)\n12 days\n(6 days\u20136 months)\nNo\nAfrica, India, South East Asia, Indonesia, \nOceania, Central America, Middle East\nP. vivax\n(\ufb01 g 9.25)\n14 days\n(days\u2013years)\nYes\nSouth Asia, South and Central America, \nAfrica, Middle East\nP. malariae \n(\ufb01 g 9.26)\n30 days\n(28 days\u2013years)\nNo\nAfrica, South and Central America, \nSouth East Asia\nP. ovale\n11\u201316 days (years)\nYes\nAfrica\nP. knowlesi\n9\u201312 days\nNo\nSouth East Asia\nReproduced from Detels et al., Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health, 2015, with permission from Oxford \nUniversity Press.\nFig 9.25 P. vivax ring partly \nhidden by Schuff ner\u2019s dots.\nStained and examined in the \n\ufb01 eld by JML.\nFig 9.26 P. malariae ring and \nband forms from 2 specimens.\n\u00a9 S Upton, Kansas Univ.\nFig 9.24 P. falciparum \nsau sage-like gam eto cytes \nin RBC.\u00a9 S Upton, Kansas Univ.\nFig 9.23 Countries with malaria transmission.\nReproduced with permission from World Health Organization, World malaria report 2015. \u00a9 World Health \nOrganization 2015. http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/report/en/", "text_length": 2464, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 424/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 423, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.903623", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.904366", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
