In ~ \u2154, \nurine contains Bence Jones proteins, which are free Ig light chains of kappa (\u03ba) or \nlambda (\u03bb) type, \ufb01 ltered by the kidney.\nIncidence 5/100 000. Peak age: 70yrs. \ue032: \ue033 \u2248 1:1. Afro-Caribbeans:Caucasians \u2248 2:1.\nClinical features \u2022 Osteolytic bone lesions cause backache, pathological fractures \nand vertebral collapse. \ue007Do serum electrophoresis on all >50 with new back pain.\n  \n\u2022 Hypercalcaemia may be symptomatic (p676).  Lesions are due to \ue000osteoclast acti-\nvation, from signalling by myeloma cells.\n  \n\u2022 Anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia may result from marrow in\ufb01 ltra-\ntion by plasma cells, leading to symptoms of anaemia, infection, and bleeding.\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent bacterial infections due to immunoparesis, and also because of neutro-\npenia due to the disease and from chemotherapy.\n  \n\u2022 Renal impairment due to light chain deposition (p314 & p370) is seen in up to 20% \nat diagnosis. The light chains have a toxic and in\ufb02 ammatory eff ect on the proximal \ntubule cells, but the damage is mainly caused by precipitation of light chains in the \ndistal loop of Henle. Deposits may rarely be AL-amyloid (causing nephrotic syn-\ndrome, see p370). Monoclonal immunoglobulins also disrupt glomeruli.\nTests Bloods: FBC: normocytic normochromic anaemia. Film: rouleaux (p328). Per-\nsistently \ue000ESR (p372). \ue000Urea and creatinine, \ue000Ca\n2+ (in ~40%). Alk phos usually \ue009 unless \nhealing fracture. Bone marrow biopsy: See \ufb01 gs 8.70\u20138.73. Screening test: Serum \nand/or urine electrophoresis. \ue0202-microglobulin (prognostic). Imaging: X-rays: lytic \n\u2018punched-out\u2019 lesions, eg pepper-pot skull, vertebral collapse, fractures, or osteopo-\nrosis. CT or MRI may be useful to detect lesions not seen on XR. Diagnostic criteria: \nSee BOX \u2018Myeloma diagnosis\u2019.\nTreatment Supportive: \u2022 Analgesia for bone pain (avoid NSAIDS due to risk of renal \nimpairment). Give all patients a bisphosphonate (clod ronate, zolendronate, or pa-\nmidronate), as they reduce fracture rates and bone pain. Local radiotherapy can help \nrapidly in focal disease. Orthopaedic procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) \nmay be helpful in vertebral collapse. \u2022 Anaemia should be corrected with transfu-\nsion, and erythropoietin may be used. \u2022 Renal failure: rehydrate, and ensure adequate \n\ufb02 uid intake of 3L/day to prevent further light chain-induced renal impairment. Di-\nalysis may be needed in acute kidney injury. \u2022 Infections: Treat rapidly with broad-\nspectrum antibiotics until culture results are known. Regular IV immunoglobulin \ninfusions may be needed if recurrent.\nChemotherapy: Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexa-\nmethasone. In suitably \ufb01 t patients this may be followed by autologous stem-cell \ntransplantation. In those unsuitable for transplantation, induction therapy is typi-\ncally continued for 12\u201318 months, or until serum paraprotein levels have plateaued. \nTreatment is then typically held until (inevitably) paraprotein levels start to rise \nagain, at which point further chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be \nconsidered. NB: lenalidomide is a teratogenic immunomodulator which has multiple \nSE, notably neutropenia and thromboembolism: monitor for sepsis and consider as-\npirin or anticoagulation if risk \ue000, eg hyperviscosity or other comorbidities.\nPrognosis Worse if: >2 osteolytic lesions, \ue0202-microglobulin >5.5mg/L, Hb <11g/L; \nalbumin <30g/L. Risk strati\ufb01 cation increasingly based upon detection of speci\ufb01 c \ncytogenetic abnormalities associated with high risk of progression.
