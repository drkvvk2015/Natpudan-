Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway used in starva-\ntion states; it is far less effi  cient, and produces acetone as a byproduct (hence the \nfruity breath of patients in ketosis). In acute diabetic ketoacidosis, there is excessive \nglucose, but because of a lack of insulin, this cannot be taken up into cells to be \nmetabolized, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where ketoacidosis \nis the only mechanism of energy production. The combination of severe acidosis \nand hyperglycaemia can be deadly, so early recognition and treatment is important.\nTypical picture Gradual drowsiness, vomiting, and dehydration in type 1 diabetic \n(very rarely type 2). \ue007Do glucose in all those with unexplained vomiting, abdo pain, \npolyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, anorexia, ketotic breath, dehydration, coma, or deep \nbreathing (sighing \u2018Kussmaul\u2019 hyperventilation). Triggers: Infection, eg UTI; surgery; \nMI; pancreatitis; chemotherapy; antipsychotics; wrong insulin dose/non-compliance.\nDiagnosis\n1   Acidaemia (venous blood pH <7.3 or HCO3\n\u03a9 < 15.0mmol/L).\n2   Hyperglycaemia (blood glucose >11.0mmol/L) or known DM.\n3   Ketonaemia (\u22653.0mmol/L) or signi\ufb01 cant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick).\nTests: ECG, CXR. Urine: Dipstick and MSU. Blood: Capillary and lab glucose, ketones, pH \n(use venous blood; ABG only if \ue001GCS or hypoxia), U&E, HCO3\n\u03a9, osmolality, FBC, blood culture.\nSevere DKA If one or more of the following features is present on admission, con-\nsider transfer to HDU/ICU for monitoring and central venous access. Get senior help!\n  \n\u2022 Blood ketones >6mmol/L.\n  \n\u2022 Venous bicarbonate <5mmol/L.\n  \n\u2022 Venous/arterial pH <7.0.\n  \n\u2022 K <3.5mmol/L on admission.\n  \n\u2022 GCS <12.\n  \n\u2022 O2 sats <92% on air (assuming no res-\npiratory disease).\n  \n\u2022 Systolic BP <90mmHg.\n  \n\u2022 Pulse >100 or <60 bpm.\n  \n\u2022 Anion gap above 16 (p670).\nManagement \ue007Replace volume then correct metabolic defects,16 see \ufb01 g 19.23.\nPitfalls in diabetic ketoacidosis\n  \n\u2022 Plasma glucose is usually high, but not always, especially if insulin continued.\n  \n\u2022 High WCC may be seen in the absence of infection.\n  \n\u2022 Infection. Often there is no fever. Do MSU, blood cultures, and CXR. Start broad-\nspectrum antibiotics (eg co-amoxiclav, p386) early if infection is suspected.\n  \n\u2022 Creatinine. Some assays for creatinine cross-react with ketone bodies, so plasma \ncreatinine may not re\ufb02 ect true renal function.\n  \n\u2022 Hyponatraemia is common, due to osmolar compensation for the hyperglycaemia. \n\ue000 or \ue009 [Na\n+] indicates severe water loss. As treatment commences Na\n+ rises as \nwater enters cells. Na\n+ is also low due to an artefact; corrected plasma [Na\n+] = Na\n+ \n+ 2.4[(glucose \u03a95.5)/5.5].\n  \n\u2022 Ketonuria does not equate with ketoacidosis. Anyone may have up to ++ketonuria \nafter an overnight fast. Not all ketones are due to diabetes\u2014consider alcohol if \nglucose normal. Always check venous blood ketones.\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent ketoacidosis. Blood glucose may return to normal long before ketones \nare removed from the blood, and premature termination of insulin infusion may \nlead to lack of clearance and return to DKA. This may be avoided by maintaining \na constant rate of insulin infusion (with co-infusion of glucose 10% to maintain \nplasma glucose at 6\u201310mmol/L) until blood ketones <0 . 6mmol/L and pH >7.3.\n  \n\u2022 Acidosis but without gross elevation of glucose may occur, but consider overdose \n(eg aspirin) and lactic acidosis (in elderly diabetics).\n  \n\u2022 Serum amylase is often raised (up to \u224810) and non-speci\ufb01 c abdominal pain is com-\nmon, even in the absence of pancreatitis.\nComplications \ue007Cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline), aspiration pneu-\nmonia, hypokalaemia, hypo magnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, thromboembolism.\nPrevention \ue007Talk to the patient: evaluate compliance and educate about triggers.", "text_length": 4023, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 840/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 839, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.633733", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.634558", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
