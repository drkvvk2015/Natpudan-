Distal obstruction of the \nCBD causes proximal dilatation of the \nduct. It is important to correlate the \nwidth of the CBD with the ALP, as the \nnormal diameter varies with age and \nprevious interventions. Also check \nthat the distal CBD tapers as it enters \nthe duodenum. NB: the portal vein lies \nposterior to the duct (along with the \nhepatic artery) in the free edge of the \nlesser omentum. Next, ask \u2018What is \ncausing the obstruction?\u2019 and \u2018Where \ncan I get that information?\u2019\nCourtesy of Norwich Radiology \nDepartment.\nFig 16.24 Longitudinal ultrasound \nof the right lobe of the liver show-\ning a well-de\ufb01 ned small area of \nechogenicity.
