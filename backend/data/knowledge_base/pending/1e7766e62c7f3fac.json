Mortality and the risk of permanent brain damage increase with the \nlength of attack. Aim to terminate seizures lasting more than a few minutes as soon \nas possible (<20min).\nStatus usually occurs in patients with known epilepsy. If it is the 1st presentation, \nthe chance of a structural brain lesion is high (>50%). Diagnosis of tonic\u2013clonic status \nis usually clear. Non-convulsive status (eg absence status or continuous partial sei-\nzures with preservation of consciousness) may be more diffi  cult: look for subtle eye \nor lid movement. For other signs, see pp484, 490\u20133. An EEG can be very helpful. \ue007Could \nthe patient be pregnant (any pelvic mass)? If so, eclampsia (OHCS p48) is the likely \ndiagnosis, check the urine and BP: call a senior obstetrician\u2014immediate delivery may \nbe needed.\nInvestigations\n  \n\u2022 Bedside glucose, the following tests can be done once \ue014 has started: lab glucose, \nABG, U&E, Ca\n2+, FBC, ECG.\n  \n\u2022 Consider anticonvulsant levels, toxicology screen, LP, culture blood and urine, EEG, \nCT, carbon monoxide level.\n  \n\u2022 Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor.\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.20. Basic life support\u2014and these agents:14\n1   Lorazepam: 0.1mg/kg (usually 4mg) as a slow bolus into a large vein. If no re-\nsponse after 10\u201320min give a second dose. Beware respiratory arrest during the \nlast part of the injection. Have full resuscitation facilities to hand for all IV benzodi-\nazepine use. The rectal route is an alternative for diazepam if IV access is diffi  cult.\nBuccal midazolam is an easier to use oral alternative where no IV access (eg in \na community setting); dose for those 10yrs old and older 10mg; if 1\u20135yrs 5mg, if \n5\u201310yrs 7 . 5mg; squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on \neach side. While waiting for this to work, prepare other drugs. If \ufb01 ts continue \u2026\n2   Phenytoin infusion: 15\u201318mg/kg IVI (roughly 1g if 60kg, and 1 . 5g if 80kg; max 2g), \nat a maximum rate of 50mg/min (don\u2019t put diazepam in same line: they don\u2019t mix). \nBeware \ue001BP and do not use if bradycardic or heart block. Requires BP and ECG \nmonitoring. 100mg/6\u20138h is a maintenance dose (check levels). If \ufb01 ts continue \u2026\n3   Seek ICU help: Paralysis and anaesthesia with eg propofol is required. Close moni-\ntoring, especially respiratory function, is vital. Consider whether this could be \npseudoseizures (p490), particularly if there are odd features (pelvic thrusts; resist-\ning attempts to open lids and your attempts to do passive movements; arms and \nlegs \ufb02 ailing around).\n4   Dexamethasone: 10mg IV if vasculitis/cerebral oedema (tumour) possible.\nAs soon as seizures are controlled, start oral drugs (p492). Ask what the cause was, \neg hypoglycaemia, pregnancy, alcohol, drugs, CNS lesion or infection, hypertensive \nencephalopathy, inadequate anticonvulsant dose/compliance (p490).", "text_length": 3021, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 834/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 833, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.624090", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.624948", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
