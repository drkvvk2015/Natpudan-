Features of type 1 include \nweight loss; persistent hyper glycaemia despite diet and medications; presence of \nautoantibodies: islet cell antibodies (ICA) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase \n(GAD) antibodies; ketonuria.\nTable 5.1 Diff erences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nType 1 DM\nType 2 DM\nEpidemiology Often starts before puberty\nOlder patients (usually)\nGenetics\nHLA D3 and D4 linked\nNo HLA association\nCause\nAutoimmune \ue020-cell destruction\nInsulin resistance/\ue020-cell dysfunction\nPresentation\nPolydipsia, polyuria, \ue001weight, ketosis Asymptomatic/complications, eg MI\n\ue007Not all new-onset DM in older people is type 2: if ketotic \u00b1 a poor response to oral hy-\npoglycaemics (and patient is slim or has a family or personal history of autoimmunity), \nthink of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and measure islet cell antibodies.\nDiff erentiating type 1 and 2 diabetes\nDietary carbohydrate is a big determinant of postprandial glucose levels, and \nlow-carbohydrate diets improve glycaemic control. How do low-carbohydrate, ke-\ntogenic diets (<20g of carbohydrate daily; LCKD) compare with low-glycaemic in-\ndex, reduced-calorie diet (eg 500kcal/day de\ufb01 cit from weight maintenance diet)? \nIn one randomized study over 24 weeks, LCKD had greater improvements in HbA1c \n(\u03a915 vs \u03a95mmol/L), weight (\u03a911kg vs \u03a97kg), and HDL. Diabetes drugs were reduced \nor eliminated in 95% of LCKD vs 62% of LGID participants.6 NB: eff ects on renal func-\ntion and mortality are unknown so these diets remain controversial.\nMonitoring glucose control\n1   Fingerprick glucose if on insulin (type 1/2). NB: before a meal informs about \nlong-acting insulin doses; after meals inform about the dose of short-acting \ninsulin.\n2   Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relates to mean glucose level over previous \n8wks (RBC t\u00bd). Targets are negotiable, eg 48\u201357mmol/mol (depends on pa-\ntient\u2019s wish and arterial risk, eg past MI or stroke). If at risk from the eff ects of \nhypoglycaemia, eg elderly patients prone to falls, consider less tight control. \nTight control may not alter all-cause mortality.7 Complications rise with rising \nHbA1c, so any improvement helps.\n3   Be sure to ask about hypoglycaemic attacks (and whether symptomatic). \nHypoglycaemic awareness may diminish if control is too tight, or with time \nin type 1 DM, due to \ue001glucagon secretion. It may return if control is loosened.\nWhat is the best diet for obese patients with type 2 diabetes?", "text_length": 3356, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 215/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 214, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.331933", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.332638", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
