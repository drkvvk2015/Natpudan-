She noticed that \n\u2018blue babies\u2019 with a patent ductus arteriosus \n(PDA) tended to survive longer than those with-\nout. This was because many blue babies have \ncongenital obstruction to pulmonary blood \ufb02 ow \n(eg pulmonary stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot, \np157) and PDAs increase blood \ufb02 ow to the lungs, \nreducing cyanosis. She devised the Blalock\u2013Taus-\nsig shunt which creates a passage from the sub-\nclavian or carotid artery to one of the pulmonary \narteries, mimicing a PDA. This dramatically im-\nproved survival in babies with tetralogy of Fallot.\nOne of the joys of cardiology is how often solu-\ntions already exist in nature and much of our \nintervention involves trying to mimic circum-\nstances that can occur naturally. Hence, a good \ngrasp of the underlying physiology is essential \nfor understanding clinical cardiology; as well as \ninteresting to pursue in its own right.", "text_length": 2234, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 104/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 103, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.039008", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.039749", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
