Altered level of con-\nsciousness implies either:\n1   A diff use, bilateral, cortical dysfunction (usually producing loss of awareness \nwith normal arousal), or\n2   Damage to the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) located through-\nout the brainstem from the medulla to the thalami (usually producing loss of \narousal with unassessable awareness). The brainstem can be aff ected directly \n(eg pontine haemorrhage) or indirectly (eg compression from transtentorial \nor cerebellar herniation secondary to a mass or oedema).\nSystematic examination:\n  \n\u2022 Level of consciousness; describe using objective words/AVPU.\n  \n\u2022 Respiratory pattern (p53)\u2014Cheyne-Stokes (brainstem lesions or compression) \nhyperventilation (acidosis, hypoxia, or, rarely, neurogenic), ataxic or apneustic \n(breath-holding) breathing (brainstem damage with grave prognosis).\n  \n\u2022 Eyes\u2014almost all patients with ARAS pathology will have eye \ufb01 ndings:\n1   Visual \ufb01 elds\u2014in light coma, test \ufb01 elds with visual threat. No blink in one \ufb01 eld \nsuggests hemianopia and contralateral hemisphere lesion.\n2   Pupils\u2014normal direct and consensual re\ufb02 exes present = intact midbrain. \nMidposition (3\u20135mm) non-reactive \u00b1 irregular = midbrain lesion. Unilateral \ndilated and unreactive (\u2018\ufb01 xed\u2019) = 3rd nerve compression. Small, reactive = \npontine lesion (\u2018pin-point pontine pupils\u2019) or drugs. Horner\u2019s syndrome (p702, \n\ufb01 g 15.4) = ipsilateral lateral medulla or hypothalamus lesion, may precede \nuncal herniation. Beware patients with false eyes or who use eye drops for \nglaucoma.\n3   Extraocular movements (EOMS)\u2014observe resting position and spontaneous \nmovement; then test the vestibulo-ocular re\ufb02 ex (VOR) with either the doll\u2019s-\nhead manoeuvre (normal if the eyes keep looking at the same point in space \nwhen the head is quickly moved laterally or vertically) or ice water calorics \n(normal if eyes deviate towards the cold ear with nystagmus to the other \nside). If present, the VOR exonerates most of the brainstem from the VIIth \nnerve nucleus (medulla) to the IIIrd (midbrain). Don\u2019t move the head unless \nthe cervical spine is cleared.\n4   Fundi\u2014papilloedema, subhyaloid haemorrhage, hypertensive retinopathy, \nsigns of other disease (eg diabetic retinopathy).\n  \n\u2022 Examine for CNS asymmetry (tone, spontaneous movements, re\ufb02 exes). One way \nto test for hemiplegia in coma is to raise both arms together and compare how \nthey fall under gravity. If one descends fast, like a lead weight, but the other \ndescends more gracefully, you have found a valuable focal sign of cortical dys-\nfunction. The same applies to the legs.\nReproduced from 'Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness: a practical scale', Graham Teasdale \nand Bryan Jennett, The Lancet, Vol 304, No. 7872, 81\u201384 (1974), Elsevier.\nThe neurological examination in coma", "text_length": 2955, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 797/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 796, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.561024", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.561840", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
