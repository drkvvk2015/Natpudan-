If non-visible \n(previously microscopic) haematuria is found, but the patient has no related \nsymptoms, what does this mean? Before rushing into a barrage of investigations, \nconsider:\n  \n\u2022 One study found that incidence of urogenital disease (eg bladder cancer) was \nno higher in those with asymptomatic microhaematuria than in those without.\n  \n\u2022 Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria is the sole presenting feature in only 4% \nof bladder cancers, and there is no evidence that these are less advanced than \nmalignancies presenting with macroscopic haematuria.\n  \n\u2022 When monitoring those with treated bladder cancer for recurrence, non-visible-\nhaematuria tests have a sensitivity of only 31% in those with super\ufb01 cial bladder \nmalignancy, in whom detection would be most useful.\n  \n\u2022 Although 80% of those with \ufb02 ank pain due to a renal stone have microscopic \nhaematuria, so do 50% of those with \ufb02 ank pain but no stone.\nThe conclusion is not that urine dipstick testing is useless, but that results should \nnot be interpreted in isolation. \ue007Unexplained non-visible haematuria in those \n>50yrs should be referred under the 2-week rule. Smokers and those with +ve \nfamily history for urothelial cancer may also be investigated diff erently from \nthose with no risk factors. It is worth considering, that in a young, \ufb01 t athlete, the \ndiagnosis is more likely to be exercise-induced haematuria. Wise doctors work \ncollaboratively with their patients. \u2018Shall we let sleeping dogs lie?\u2019 is a reasonable \nquestion for some patients. \nIs asymptomatic non-visible haematuria signi\ufb01 cant?\nTable 13.19 TNM staging of bladder cancer (See also p523)\nTis\nCarcinoma in situ\nTa\nTumour con\ufb01 ned to epithelium\nT1\nTumour in submucosa or lamina propria\nT2\nInvades muscle\nT3\nExtends into perivesical fat\nT4\nInvades adjacent organs\nN0\nNo LN involved\nN1\u2013N3\nProgressive LN involvement\nM0\nNo metastases\nM1\nDistant metastasis\nReproduced with permission from Edge, SB et al.
