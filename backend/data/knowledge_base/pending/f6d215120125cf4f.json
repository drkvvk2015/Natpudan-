A single dose given before surgery \nhas been shown to be just as good as more prolonged regimens in biliary and colo-\nrectal surgery. Additional doses may be given if high-risk/prolonged procedures, or \nif major blood loss. \ue007Wound infections are not necessarily trivial since sepsis may \nlead to haemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and initiate a fatal chain of events, so take \nmeasures to minimize the risk of wound infection:\n  \n\u2022 Time administration correctly (eg IV prophylaxis should be given 30min prior to \nsurgery to maximize skin concentration; metronidazole PR is given 2h before).\n  \n\u2022 Use antibiotics which will kill anaerobes and coliforms.\n  \n\u2022 Consider use of peri-operative supplemental oxygen. This is a practical method \nof reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections.\n  \n\u2022 Practise strictly sterile surgical technique. (Ask for a hand with scrubbing up if \nyou are not sure\u2014theatre staff  will be more than pleased to help!)\nAntibiotic regimens \ue007Adhere to local guidelines. BNF examples include:\n  \n\u2022 Appendicectomy; colorectal resections and open biliary surgery: A single \ndose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h or gentamicin 1.5mg/kg + metronidazole \n500mg or co-amoxiclav 1.2g alone.\n  \n\u2022 Oesophageal or gastric surgery: 1 dose of IV gentamicin or piperacillin/tazo-\nbactam or co-amoxiclav (doses as for appendicectomy).\n  \u2022 Vascular surgery: 1 dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam or \ufb02 ucloxacillin 1\u20132g + \ngentamicin. Add metronidazole if risk of anaerobes (eg amputations, gangrene, \nor diabetes).\n  \u2022 MRSA: For high-risk patients add teicoplanin or vancomycin to the above-listed \nregimens.\nTable 13.1 Classi\ufb01 cation of surgical procedures and wound infection risk\nCategory\nDescription\nInfection risk\nClean\nIncising uninfected skin without opening a viscus\n<2%\nClean-contaminated\nIntra-operative breach of a viscus (but not colon)\n8\u201310%\nContaminated\nBreach of a viscus + spillage or opening of colon\n12\u201320%\nDirty\nThe site is already contaminated with pus or \nfaeces, or from exogenous contagion, eg trauma\n25%\nData from MRCS Core Modules: Essential Revision Notes, S.
