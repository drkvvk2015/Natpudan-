See table 4.11 and \ufb01 g 4.19.\nClinical features Dyspnoea on exertion; non-productive paroxysmal cough; ab-\nnormal breath sounds; abnormal CXR or high-resolution CT; restrictive pulmonary \nspirometry with \ue001DLCO (p164).\nPathological features Fibrosis and remodelling of the interstitium; chronic in\ufb02 am-\nmation; hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes.\nClassi\ufb01 cation The ILDS can be broadly grouped into three categories:\nThose with known cause, eg:\n  \n\u2022 Occupational/environmental, eg asbestosis, berylliosis, silicosis, cotton worker\u2019s \nlung (byssinosis).\n  \n\u2022 Drugs, eg nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan.\n  \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, eg hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n  \n\u2022 Infections, eg TB, fungi, viral.\n  \n\u2022 Gastro-oesophageal re\ufb02 ux.\nThose associated with systemic disorders, eg:\n  \n\u2022 Sarcoidosis.\n  \n\u2022 Rheumatoid arthritis.\n  \n\u2022 SLE, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\n  \n\u2022 Ulcerative colitis, renal tubular acidosis, autoimmune thyroid disease.\nIdiopathic, eg:\n  \n\u2022 Idiopathic pulmonary \ufb01 brosis (IPF, p200).\n  \n\u2022 Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n  \n\u2022 Non-speci\ufb01 c interstitial pneumonitis.\nExtrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)\nIn sensitized individuals, repetitive inhalation of allergens (fungal spores or avian \nproteins) provokes a hypersensitivity reaction which varies in intensity and clini-\ncal course depending on the antigen. In the acute phase, the alveoli are in\ufb01 ltrated \nwith acute in\ufb02 ammatory cells. Early diagnosis and prompt allergen removal can halt \nand reverse disease progression, so prognosis can be good. With chronic exposure, \ngranuloma formation and obliterative bronchiolitis occur.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Bird-fancier\u2019s and pigeon-fancier\u2019s lung (proteins in bird droppings).\n  \n\u2022 Farmer\u2019s and mushroom worker\u2019s lung (Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactino-\nmyces vulgaris).\n  \n\u2022 Malt worker\u2019s lung (Aspergillus clavatus).\n  \n\u2022 Bagassosis or sugar worker\u2019s lung (Thermoactinomyces sacchari ).\nClinical features 4\u20136h post-exposure: Fever, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, dyspnoea, \n\ufb01 ne bibasal crackles. Chronic: Finger clubbing (50%), increasing dyspnoea, \ue001weight, \nexertional dyspnoea, type I respiratory failure, cor pulmonale.\nTests Acute: Blood: FBC (neutrophilia); \ue000ESR; ABGS; serum antibodies (may indicate \nexposure/previous sensitization rather than disease). CXR: upper-zone mottling/con-\nsolidation; hilar lymph adenopathy (rare). Lung function tests: Reversible restrictive \ndefect; reduced gas transfer during acute attacks. Chronic: Blood tests: serum anti-\nbodies. CXR: upper-zone \ufb01 brosis; honeycomb lung. CT chest: nodules, ground glass ap-\npearance, extensive \ufb01 brosis. Lung function tests: restrictive defect. Bronchoalveolar \nlavage (BAL) \ufb02 uid shows \ue000lymphocytes and \ue000mast cells.\nManagement Acute: Remove allergen and give O2 (35\u201360%), PO prednisolone \n(40mg/24h PO), reducing course. Chronic: Allergen avoidance, or wear a facemask \nor +ve pressure helmet. Long-term steroids often achieve CXR and physiological im-\nprovement.
