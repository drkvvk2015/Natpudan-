Assess global vascular risk; start a high-intensity sta-\ntin (p115), eg atorvastatin as tolerated, control BP (p211). Give foot-care (p212). (Pre-)\npregnancy care should be in a multidisciplinary clinic (OHCS p23).

Avoid if eGFR \n\ue00536mL/min (due to risk lactic acidosis).\nDPP4 inhibitors/gliptins: (Eg sitagliptin.) Block the action of DPP-4, an enzyme which \ndestroys the hormone incretin.\nGlitazone: \ue000 insulin sensitivity; SE: hypo glycaemia, fractures, \ufb02 uid retention, \ue000LFT (do \nLFT every 8wks for 1yr, stop if ALT up >3-fold).
