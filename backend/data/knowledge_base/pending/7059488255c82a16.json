Refer to smoking ces-\nsation services. Check plasma lipids.\nLook for complications \u2022Check injection sites for infection or lipohypertrophy \n(fatty change): advise on rotating sites of injection if present.\n  \n\u2022 Vascular disease: Chief cause of death. MI is 4-fold commoner in DM and is more \nlikely to be \u2018silent\u2019. Stroke is twice as common. Women are at high risk\u2014DM re-\nmoves the vascular advantage conferred by the female sex. Address other risk \nfactors\u2014diet, smoking, hypertension (p93). Suggest a statin (eg atorvastatin 20mg \nnocte) for all, even if no overt IHD, vascular disease, or micro albuminuria. Aspirin \n75mg reduces vascular events (in context of secondary prevention). Safe to use in \ndiabetic retinopathy.11\n  \u2022 Nephropathy: (p314.) Microalbuminuria is when urine dipstick is \u03a9ve for protein \nbut the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UA:CR) is \ue0063mg/mmol (units vary, check lab) \nre\ufb02 ecting early renal disease and \ue000vascular risk. If UA:CR >3, inhibiting the renin\u2013\nangiotensin system with an ACE-i or sartan, even if BP is normal, protects the kidneys. \nSpironolactone may also help.12 Refer if UA:CR >7 \u00b1 GFR falling by >5mL/min/1.73m\n2/yr.13\n  \n\u2022 Diabetic retinopathy: Blindness is preventable. \ue007Annual retinal screening man-\ndatory for all patients. Refer to an ophthalmologist if pre-proliferative changes \nor if any uncertainty at or near the macula (the only place capable of 6/6 vision). \n\ue007Pre-symptomatic screening enables laser photocoagulation to be used, aimed to \nstop production of angiogenic factors from the ischaemic retina. Indications: macu-\nlopathy or proliferative retinopathy. See \ufb01 gs 5.6\u20135.9.\n  \n\u2022 Background retinopathy: Microaneurysms (dots), haemorrhages (blots), and \nhard exud ates (lipid deposits). Refer if near the macula, eg for intravitreal tri-\namcinolone. \n  \n\u2022 Pre-proliferative retinopathy: Cotton-wool spots (eg infarcts), haemorrhag-\nes, venous beading. These are signs of retinal ischaemia. Refer to a specialist.\n  \n\u2022 Proliferative retinopathy: New vessels form. Needs urgent referral.\n  \n\u2022 Maculopathy: (Hard to see in early stages.) Suspect if \ue001acuity. Prompt \nlaser, intra vitreal steroids, or anti-angiogenic agents may be needed in \nmacular oedema. Pathogenesis: Capillary endothelial change \ue003 vascular \nleak \ue003 microaneurysms \ue003 capillary occlusion \ue003 local hypoxia + ischae-\nmia \ue003 new vessel formation. High retinal blood \ufb02 ow caused by hypergly-\ncaemia (and \ue000BP and pregnancy) triggers this, causing capillary pericyte \ndamage. Microvascular occlusion causes cotton-wool spots (\u00b1 blot haemor-\nrhages at interfaces with perfused retina). New vessels form on the disc \nor ischaemic areas, proliferate, bleed, \ufb01 brose, and can detach the retina. \nAspirin\n2 (2mg/kg/d) may be recommended by ophthalmologists; there is no \nevidence that it \ue000 bleeding.\n  \n\u2022 Cataracts: May be juvenile \u2018snow\ufb02 ake\u2019 form, or \u2018senile\u2019\u2014which occur earlier in \ndiabetic subjects. Osmotic changes in the lens induced in acute hyperglycaemia \nreverse with normoglycaemia (so wait before buying glasses).\n  \n\u2022 Rubeosis iridis: New vessels on iris: occurs late and may lead to glaucoma.\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic complications: p832.\n  \n\u2022 Diabetic feet: p212.\n  \n\u2022 Neuropathy: p212.\n2 As DM has so many vascular events, particularly encourage statin use (p690), esp. if LDL >3mmol/L or systolic \nBP >140.
