Classi\ufb01 ca-\ntion is by autoantibodies (see table 6.12). AIH predominantly aff ects young or middle-\naged women (bimodal, ie 10\u201330yrs\u2014or >40yrs old). Up to 40% present with acute \nhepatitis and signs of autoimmune disease, eg fever, malaise, urticarial rash, polyar-\nthritis, pleurisy, pulmonary in\ufb01 ltration, or glomerulo nephritis. The remainder present \nwith gradual jaundice or are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with signs of \nchronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common and disease tends to attenuate during \npregnancy. Complications Those associated with cirrhosis (p276) and drug therapy.\nTests Serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP all usually \ue000, hypergammaglobulinaemia (esp. \nIgG), +ve autoantibodies (see table 6.12). Anaemia, \ue001WCC, and \ue001platelets indicate hy-\npersplenism. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Mononuclear in\ufb01 ltrate of portal and peripor-\ntal areas and piecemeal necrosis \u00b1 \ufb01 brosis; cirrhosis \u2248 worse prognosis. MRCP: (See \np742.) Helps exclude PSC if ALP \ue000 disproportionately.\nDiagnosis Depends on excluding other diseases (no lab test is pathognomonic). Di-\nagnostic criteria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in the absence \nof viral disease are helpful. Sometimes diagnosis is a challenge\u2014there is overlap \nwith other chronic liver disease: eg PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis.\nTable 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I\u2013II\nI Seen in 80%. Typical patient: \ue033 <40yrs. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve \nin 80% . Antinuclear antibody (ANA) +ve in 10%. \ue000IgG in 97%. Good response to \nimmunosuppression in 80%. 25% have cirrhosis at presentation.\nII Commoner in Europe than USA. More often seen in children, and more commonly \nprogresses to cirrhosis and less treatable. Typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal \ntype 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve. ASMA and ANA \u03a9ve.\nManagement Immunosuppressant therapy: Prednisolone 30mg/d PO for 1 \nmonth; \ue001 by 5mg a month to a maintenance dose of 5\u201310mg/d PO. Corticoster-\noids can sometimes be stopped after 2yrs but relapse occurs in 50\u201386%. Aza-\nthioprine (50\u2013100mg/d PO) may be used as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain \nremission. Remission is achievable in 80% of patients within 3yrs. 10- and 20yr \nsurvival rates are >80%. SES are a big problem (p376)\u2014partly ameliorated by a \nswitch to budesonide, eg in non-cirrhotic AIH. \nLiver transplantation: (See p277.) Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if \nthere is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is ef-\nfective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%).\nPrognosis Appears not to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at \npresentation (10yr survival ~80% for both). The presence of cirrhosis at presenta-\ntion reduces 10yr survival from 94% to 62%. Overlap syndromes: AIH-PBC (primary \nbiliary cholangitis) overlap is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis).\n33 Hepatotropic viruses (eg measles, herpes viruses) and some drugs appear to trigger AIH in geneti-\ncally predisposed individuals exposed to a hepatotoxic milieu int\u00e9rieur. Viral interferon can inactivate \ncytochrome P450 enzymes (\ue018 \ue001 metabolism of ex- or endogenous hepatotoxins). Resulting modi\ufb01 cations to \nproteins may generate autoantigens driving CD4 T-helper cell activation.", "text_length": 3724, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 292/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 291, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.675684", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.676583", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
