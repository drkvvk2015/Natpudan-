The \natrioventricular node (AVN) receives \nthis activity, pauses, then passes it \non, down the bundle of His which \nsplits into left and right bundle \nbranches. These cause depolariza-\ntion of the ventricular myocardium \nfrom bottom (apex) to top (out\ufb02 ow \ntracts).\nRegular rhythm tachycardia\nSee \ufb01 g 3.27.\nA. Sinus tachycardia: Conduction \noccurs as per \ufb01 g 3.26 but impulses \nare initiated at a high frequency. \nCauses include infection, pain, ex-\nercise, anxiety, dehydration, bleed, \nsystemic vasodilation (eg in sepsis), \ndrugs (caff eine, nicotine, salbuta-\nmol), anaemia, fever, PE, hyperthy-\nroidism, pregnancy, CO2 retention, \nautonomic neuropathy (eg inappro-\npriate sinus tachycardia).\nB. Focal atrial tachycardia: A \ngroup of atrial cells act as a pace-\nmaker, out-pacing the SAN. P-wave \nmorphology (shape) is diff erent to \nsinus.\nC. Atrial \ufb02 utter: Electrical activity circles the atria 300 times per minute, giving a \n\u2018sawtooth\u2019 baseline, see \ufb01 g 3.35. The AVN passes some of these impulses on, result-\ning in ventricular rates that are factors of 300 (150, 100, 75).\nD. Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia: (AVRT) An accessory pathway (eg in \nWolff -Parkinson-White (WPW), p133) allows electrical activity from the ventricles \nto pass to the resting atrial myocytes, creating a circuit: atria\u2013AVN\u2013ventricles\u2013\naccessory pathway\u2013atria. This direction is called \u2018orthodromic\u2019 conduction and \nresults in narrow QRS complexes as ventricular depolarization is triggered via the \nbundles of His. Conduction in the other direction is called \u2018antidromic\u2019 and results \nin broad QRS complexes.\nE. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia: (AVNRT) Circuits form within the \nAVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very common.\nF. Junctional tachycardia: Cells in the AVN become the pacemaker, giving nar-\nrow QRS complexes as impulses reach the ventricles through the normal routes; P \nwaves may be inverted and late.\nG. Bundle branch block: Any of the above conditions can result in broad complex \ntachycardias if there is bundle branch block (see p100).\nH. Ventricular tachycardia: (VT) This can result from circuits, similar to atrial \n\ufb02 utter, or from focuses of rapidly-\ufb01 ring cells. The QRS is broad. When a circuit \nis in action and its plane rotates, the ECG shows broad complex tachycardia with \nregularly increasing and decreasing amplitudes; this is called torsades de pointes.\nNormal conduction\nFig 3.26 Normal conduction. \nFig 3.27 Regular tachycardias. \nHis bundle\nSAN\nMV\nTV\nAVN\nLeft\nbundle\nbranch\nRight\nbundle\nbranch\nLeft\nanterior\nand\nposterior\nhemi fascicle\nA\nB\nC\nF\nE\nD\nH\nG\n+", "text_length": 2816, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 135/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 134, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.090675", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.091835", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
