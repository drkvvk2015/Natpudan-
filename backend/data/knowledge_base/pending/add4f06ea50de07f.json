Chronic renal infection of carrier animals: rodent, \ncattle, pigs. Spread by water/soil/food contaminated by infected animal urine. Pres-\nentation: Incubation ~7d (2\u201330d). 1st (acute/septicaemic) phase: fever, non-speci\ufb01 c \n\ufb02 u-like symptoms. Mild/subclinical in ~90%. Followed by recovery or 2nd (immune/\nleptospiruric) phase: conjunctival suff usion, myalgia (\ue000CK), jaundice, meningitis, uvei-\ntis, AKI, pulmonary haemorrhage, ARDS, myo/pericarditis. (Weil\u2019s disease described in \n1886: fever, jaundice splenomegaly, renal failure, CNS symptoms. Term now applied to \nall severe disease.) Diagnosis: In UK18 via National Leptospirosis Service (https://www.\ngov.uk/guidance/leptospira-reference-unit-services). Culture (blood/CSF) +ve during 1st phase. \nSerology. PCR. Treatment: Doxycycline, penicillin. Con\ufb02 icting evidence of bene\ufb01 t for \nsteroids in severe disease.\nYersinia pestis (plague)\nGram \u03a9ve, obligate intracellular pathogen transmitted by small animals and their \ufb02 eas \nby bite, direct contact, inhalation or ingestion (rare). ~300 cases/yr worldwide. Presen-\ntation: Incubation: 3\u20137d. Flu-like symptoms, then one of three disease forms:\n1   Bubonic: most common form. Yersinia pestis enters at bite and travels via lym-\nphatics. In\ufb02 amed, painful lymph node is termed \u2019bubo\u2019 and can suppurate.\n2   Septi caemic: direct spread without \u2018bubo\u2019, or advanced stage after \u2018bubo\u2019.\n3  Pneumonic: lung disease. Most virulent, least common. Usually from advanced bu-\nbonic form but can then transmit via droplets to other humans without \ufb02 eas/animals.\nDiagnosis: Culture bubo \ufb02 uid, blood, sputum. Rapid antigen testing available.\nTreatment: Reduces mortality from 60% to <15%: streptomycin, tetracycline.12 \nToxoplasmosis\nFig 9.34 Oocysts in cat faeces can \nstay in the soil for months, where \nrats eat them. The rats get infected, \nand, under the direction of Toxoplas-\nma in the amygdala, the rats lose \ntheir fear of cats, and so get eaten in \nturn. So the parasite ensure success \nby facilitating a jump from interme-\ndiate to de\ufb01 nitive host. How does \nthe parasite overwhelm the innate \nfear of cats? By causing a sexual \nattraction to normally aversive cat \nodour through limbic activity.\nFrom Fernando Monroy:\nwww2.nau.edu/~fpm/research/res.html\nCaused by protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. Found worldwide. Life cycle (\ufb01 g 9.34). \nInfection is lifelong (~\u2153 of population). HIV may cause reactivation (p400).\nPresentation: Asymptomatic in ~90%. Self-limiting cervical lymphadenopathy, low-\ngrade fever if normal immune system. Disseminated disease if immunosuppressed: \ncerebral abscess, encephalitis, choroidoretinitis, myocarditis, myositis, pneumoni-\ntis, hepatitis. Congenital infection: pregnancy loss, neurocognitive de\ufb01 cit, retinal \ndamage. Diagnosis: In UK via Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory (0179 228 5058). \nSerology: IgG=previous exposure (high avidity IgG suggests infection >3\u20135 months \nago, used in pregnancy); IgM=acute infection, false +ve or chronic infection with per-\nsistent IgM; IgA in cord serum=congenital infection. PCR: blood/CSF/urine/amniotic \n\ufb02 uid/aqueous/vitreous humour. Treatment: If eye disease, immunosuppressed or \nneonate: pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + folinic acid. Corticosteroids for eye in\ufb02 am-\nmation. Spiramycin reduces vertical transmission. Prophylaxis: co-trimoxazole (see \nHIV, p400).\nEchinococcosis (hydatid disease) p435. Rabies p437.
