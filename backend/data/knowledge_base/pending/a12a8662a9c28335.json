Eg respiratory depression from induction agents.\n  \n\u2022 From surgery in general: (p576.) Eg wound infection, haemorrhage, neurovas-\ncular damage, DVT/PE.\n  \n\u2022 From the speci\ufb01 c procedure: Eg saphenous nerve damage in stripping of the \nlong varicose vein.\nTailor the discussion towards the individual who, eg if an arteriopath, may have a \nsigni\ufb01 cant risk of cardiac ischaemia during hypotensive episodes while under the \nanaesthetic. For some other post-op complications, see:\n\u2022 Pain (p574) \u2022 DVT (p578) \u2022 Pulmonary embolus (p190; massive, p818) \u2022 Wound de-\nhiscence (p580) \u2022 Complications in post-gastric surgery (p622) \u2022 Other complica-\ntions of speci\ufb01 c operations (p580).\nTalking about post-op complications\u2026\nPrimary haemorrhage: Continuous bleeding, starting during surgery. Replace \nblood loss. If severe, return to theatre for adequate haemostasis. Treat shock \nvigorously (p790\u2013804).\nReactive haemorrhage: Haemostasis appears secure until BP rises and bleeding \nstarts. Replace blood and re-explore wound.\nSecondary haemorrhage (caused by infection) occurs 1\u20132wks post-op.\nPost-operative bleeding", "text_length": 1455, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 585/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 584, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.183637", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.184681", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
