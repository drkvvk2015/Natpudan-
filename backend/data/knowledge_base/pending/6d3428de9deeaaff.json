Think systematically. Is it in the brain-\nstem (eg MS) or outside, pressing on the brainstem? \nIs it the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia) or the \nmuscles (eg a dystrophy)? Cranial nerves may be af-\nfected singly or in groups. \ue007Face the patient (helps \nspot asymmetry). For causes of lesions see BOX \u2018Caus-\nes of cranial nerve lesions\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 I: Smell\u2014test ability of each nostril (separately) to \ndistinguish familiar smells, eg coff ee.\n  \u2022 II: Acuity\u2014test each eye separately, and its correct-\nability with glasses or pin-hole; use Snellen chart, or \nthe one inside the cover of this book. Visual \ufb01 elds\u2014 \ncompare with your own \ufb01 elds or formally via perim-\netry testing. Any losses/inattention? Sites of lesions: \nOHCS p428. Pupils (p72)\u2014size, shape, symmetry, reac-\ntion to light (direct and consensual) or accommoda-\ntion. Swinging light test for relative aff erent pupillary \ndefect. Ophthalmoscopy (OHCS, p414)\u2014best learnt from an ophthalmologist and dilat-\ning drops help! Darken the room, warn the patient you will need to get close to their \nface. Focus the lens on the optic disc (pale? swollen?). Follow vessels outwards to view \neach quadrant. If the view is obscured, examine the red re\ufb02 ex, with your focus on the \nmargin of the pupil, to look for a cataract. Try to get a view of the fovea by asking the \npatient to look directly at the ophthalmoscope \ue007Pathology here needs prompt oph-\nthalmic review. If in doubt, ask for slit lamp examination or photography of the retina.\n  \n\u2022 III p, IV, & VI\u2014eye movements. Ask the patient to keep their head still and follow \nyour \ufb01 nger as you trace an imaginary \u2018H\u2019. IIIrd nerve palsy\u2014ptosis, large pupil, \neye down and out. IVth nerve palsy\u2014diplopia on looking down and in (often no-\nticed on descending stairs)\u2014head tilting compensates for this (ocular torticollis). \nVIth nerve palsy\u2014horizontal diplopia on looking out. Nystagmus is involuntary, \noften jerky, eye oscillations. Horizontal nystagmus is often due to a vestibular le-\nsion (acute: nystagmus away from lesion; chronic: towards lesion), or cerebellar \nlesion (unilateral lesions cause nystagmus towards the aff ected side). If it is more \nin whichever eye is abducting, MS may be the cause (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, \nsee \ufb01 g 2.34). If also deafness/tinnitus, suspect a peripheral cause (eg VIIIth nerve \nlesion, barotrauma, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s, p462). If it varies with head position, suspect benign \npositional vertigo (p462). If it is up-and-down, ask a neurologist to review\u2014upbeat \nnystagmus classically occurs with lesions in the midbrain or at the base of the 4th \nventricle, downbeat nystagmus in foramen magnum lesions. Nystagmus lasting \u22642 \nbeats is normal, as is nystagmus at the extremes of gaze.\n  \n\u2022 V: Motor palsy\u2014\u2018Open your mouth\u2019; jaw deviates to side of lesion, muscles of mas-\ntication (temporalis, masseter and pterygoids). Sensory\u2014check all three divisions. \nConsider corneal re\ufb02 ex (lost \ufb01 rst).\n  \n\u2022 VII: p Facial nerve lesions cause droop and weakness. As the forehead has bilateral \nrepresentation in the brain, only the lower two-thirds is aff ected in UMN lesions, but \nall of one side of the face in LMN lesions. Ask to \u2018raise your eyebrows\u2019, \u2018show me your \nteeth\u2019, \u2018puff  out your cheeks\u2019. Test taste with salt/sweet solutions (supplies anterior \ntwo-thirds of tongue).\n  \n\u2022 VIII: Hearing\u2014p464. Ask to repeat a number whispered in an ear while you block \nthe other. Perform Weber\u2019s and Rinne\u2019s tests (p464). Balance/vertigo\u2014p462.\n  \n\u2022 IX p & X: p Gag re\ufb02 ex\u2014ask the patient to say \u2018Ah\u2019. Xth nerve lesions also cause the pal-\nate to be pulled to the normal side on saying \u2018Ah\u2019, uvula deviates away. Ask them to \nswallow a sip of water. Consider gag re\ufb02 ex\u2014touch the back of the soft palate with \nan orange stick. The aff erent arm of the re\ufb02 ex involves IX; the eff erent arm involves X.\n  \n\u2022 XI: Trapezii\u2014\u2018Shrug your shoulders\u2019 against resistance. Sternocleidomastoid: \n\u2018Turn your head to the left/right\u2019 against resistance.\n  \n\u2022 XII: Tongue movement\u2014the tongue deviates to the side of the lesion.\nI olfactory\nII optic\nIII oculomotor\nIV trochlear\nV1 ophthalmic division\nV2 maxillary division\nV3 mandibular division\nVI abducens\nVII facial\nVIII vestibulo cochlear\nIX glossopharyngeal\nX vagus\nXI accessory\nXII hypoglossal\nCranial nerve names", "text_length": 4468, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 82/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 81, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.003091", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.003927", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
