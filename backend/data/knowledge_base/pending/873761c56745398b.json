Do your best to help, and get social services involved \nif concerned. Continence depends on many factors\u2014mental function, stool (volume \nand consistency), anatomy (sphincter function, rectal distensibility, anorectal sensa-\ntion and re\ufb02 exes). Defects in any area can cause loss of faecal continence.\nCauses: Often multifactorial. Is it passive faecal soiling or urgency-related stool \nloss? Consider the following:\n  \n\u2022 Sphincter dysfunction:\n  \n\u2022 Vaginal delivery is the commonest cause due to sphincter tears or pudendal \nnerve damage.\n  \n\u2022 Surgical trauma, eg following procedures for \ufb01 stulas, haemorrhoids, \ufb01 ssures.\n  \n\u2022 Impaired sensation\u2014diabetes, MS, dementia, any spinal cord lesions (\ue022consider \ncord compression if acute faecal incontinence).\n  \n\u2022 Faecal impaction\u2014over\ufb02 ow diarrhoea, extremely common, especially in the el-\nderly, and very easily treated.\n  \n\u2022 Idiopathic\u2014although there is often no clear cause found, especially in elderly \nwomen, this is usually multifactorial, including a combination of poor sphincter \ntone and pudendal damage leading to poor sensation.\nAssessment:\n\ue007Do PR (over\ufb02 ow incontinence? poor tone?) and assess neurological function of legs, \nparticularly checking sensation.\nRefer to a specialist (esp. if rectal prolapse, anal sphincter injury, lumbar disc disease, \nor alarm symptoms for colon ca exist). Consider anorectal manometry, pelvic ultra-\nsound or MRI, and pudendal nerve testing may be needed.\nTreat according to cause and to promote dignity:\n\ue007Never let your own embarrassment stop you from off ering help. Knowledge and \nbehaviour are key factors:\n  \n\u2022 Ensure toilet is in easy reach. Plan trips in the knowledge of toilet locations.\n  \n\u2022 Obey call-to-stool impulses (esp. after meal, ie the gastro-colic re\ufb02 ex).\n  \n\u2022 Ensure access to latest continence aids and advice on use, refer to continence \nnurse specialist for assessment.\n  \n\u2022 Pelvic \ufb02 oor rehabilitation: eg can help faecal incontinence, squeeze pressure, and \nmaximal tolerated volume.\n  \n\u2022 Loperamide 2\u20134mg 45min before social engagements may prevent accidents out-\nside home. An anal cotton plug may help isolated internal sphincter weakness. Skin \ncare. Support agencies.\nIf all sensible measures fail, try a brake-and-accelerator approach: enemas to empty \nthe rectum (twice weekly) and codeine phosphate, eg 15mg/12h, on non-enema days \nto constipate. It\u2019s not a cure, but makes the incontinence manageable.\nFlatulence\nNormally, 400\u20131300mL of gas is expelled PR in 8\u201320 discrete (or indiscrete) episodes \nper day. If this, with any eructation (belching) or distension, seems excessive to the \npatient, they may complain of \ufb02 atulence. Eructation occurs in hiatus hernia\u2014but \nmost patients with \u2018\ufb02 atulence\u2019 have no GI disease. Air swal lowing (aerophagy) is the \nmain cause of \ufb02 atus; here N2 is the chief gas. If \ufb02 atus is mostly methane, H2 and CO2, \nthen fermentation by bowel bacteria is the cause, and reducing carbohydrate intake \n(eg less lactose and wheat) may help.", "text_length": 3171, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 70/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 69, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.982739", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.984374", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
