Examine for \ufb02 uid overload and check K\n+. If on PD \nare they well enough to perform it themselves? Refer urgently to renal on-call.\n2   When will they need dialysis? When are they due to dialyse next? Weigh them. \nAll patients on dialysis have a target weight at which they are considered \neuvolaemic. How much are they above it? Do they have any useful urine output \n(ie that may help them lose volume/K\n+)? Refer to renal in a timely manner.\n3   What is your diagnosis? History and examination as for any other patient. Do \nnot measure BP on \ufb01 stula arm. Remember \ue000risk for CVD but troponin has \n\ue001speci\ufb01 city in ESRF.\n4   Treat. Remember to dose adjust for renal failure\u2014includes antibiotics, opi-\nates, insulin, and low-molecular-weight heparin (see www.renaldrugdatabase.com, \np305). Care with \ufb02 uid replacement in sepsis: be guided by clinical examination \nand target weight. If unsure get expert help. If volume depleted give a 250mL \nbolus of (non-K\n+ containing) crystalloid over 15min with close observation. \nAvoid maintenance \ufb02 uids in those who normally have a \ufb02 uid restriction. Do \nnot use a dialysis line or \ufb01 stula for IV access\u2014if a cannula is necessary, \npreferentially use the back of the hand, save other vessels for future \ufb01 stulas.\n5   Surgery needs senior anaesthetic and renal input. Aim for pre-op K\n+ \n<5.5mmol/L (<5.0mmol/L if major surgery with risk of tissue breakdown/\nhaemolysis). Check K\n+ urgently post-op (venous gas in recovery). In elective \nsurgery, plan dialysis provision pre- and post-op. \nWhen a patient on dialysis presents...\nTen years is a long time. For those ten years, or just over 3,560 times, I attached \nmyself to a peritoneal dialysis machine and underwent nine hours and \ufb01 fty min-\nutes of nightly therapy. I subsequently learned to do a lot of crosswords and read \na ridiculous amount of books. In ten years I had just three incidents: an inguinal \nhernia due to thinking that I could move a sofa (I could not), a parathyroidectomy \n(my knees were much happier afterwards), and one unfortunate bout of peritoni-\ntis (once was enough). Statistically speaking, I am an anomaly: the \u2018average\u2019 life \nspan of a peritoneal dialysis patient is four years.\nAdmittedly, I did not initially cope well with needing to be on dialysis. After hav-\ning lived successfully with a transplant, a return to dialysis felt like failure. I did not \nwant the hassle of treatment. I did not want piles of boxes cluttering up our home. \nMostly, I did not want a PD catheter jutting out of my belly. But what I originally \nbelieved to be unacceptable, gradually became tolerable. This took time. It took \ncare and support. It took experiencing relative health, and seeing that dialysis life, \nalthough diff erent to existing with a transplant, could be lived well.\nNatasha Boone , author and illustrator, www.normalnotnormal.com; www.natashaboone.com\nWarning: there is no normal\nMostly we commute to work each day driven by motives we would rather not \nlook at too deeply. But one renal physician used a red canoe to commute each day \nfrom his houseboat to the hospital. He could have been a very rich man but instead \nBelding Scribner gave his invention away, and continued his modest existence.\nHe invented the Scribner shunt\u2014a U of te\ufb02 on connecting an artery to a vein, al-\nlowing haemodialysis to be something that could be repeated as often as needed. \nBefore Scribner, glass tubes had to be painfully inserted into blood vessels, which \nwould be damaged by the procedure so that haemodialysis could be done for \nonly a few cycles. Clyde Shields was his \ufb01 rst patient in 1960, and said that his \ufb01 rst \ntreatment \u2018took so much of the waste I\u2019d stored up out of me that it was just like \nturning on the light from darkness\u2019. Scribner took something that was 100% fatal \nand turned it into a condition with a 90% survival.\nOn 19 June 2003, his canoe was found a\ufb02 oat but empty. And like those ancient \nIndian burial canoes found at Wiskam which have been polished to an unimagina-\nble lustre by the action of the shifting sands around the Island of the Dead, so we \npolish and cherish the image of this man who gave everything away to help others.\nThe man in a red canoe who saved a million lives", "text_length": 4345, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 315/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 314, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.708342", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.709162", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
