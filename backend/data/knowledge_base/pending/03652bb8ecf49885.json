Classi\ufb01 ed according to protein: light chains in \nmyeloma = AL amyloid; serum amyloid A in chronic in\ufb02 ammation = AA amyloid; also \nrare familial types. Diagnosis: Congo red staining on biopsy, SAP scan. Treatment: \nUnderlying condition. New therapies target amyloid production, aggregation, and \nbreakdown.\nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)\nPresents with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Hb <100g/L, \ue000LDH, \n\ue001haptoglobin, fragments on blood \ufb01 lm), \ue001platelets and AKI due to thrombosis of the \nglomerular capillaries (microangiopathy). In children, primarily associated with \nhaemorrhagic colitis due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) eg O157:H7. Atypi-\ncal HUS caused by dysregulation/uncontrolled activation of complement = ~ 5% of \nHUS. Can be precipitated by pregnancy. Diagnosis: Triad of haemolytic anaemia, \n\ue001platelets, and AKI with haematuria/proteinuria. ?Evidence of STEC. Look for abnor-\nmalities in the complement pathway: levels of C3, C4, factors H and I, complement \nmutation screen. Treatment: STEC-HUS: supportive. aHUS: plasma infusion/exchange, \neculizumab (anti-C5) in England via the national aHUS centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)\nSymptoms overlap with HUS (see previous paragraph). Pentad: microangiopathic \nhaemolytic anaemia, \ue001platelets, AKI , neurological symptoms (headache, palsies, sei-\nzure, confusion, coma), and fever. Due to a congenital de\ufb01 ciency of, or acquired anti-\nbodies to, the ADAMTS13 protease which normally cleaves multimers of von Willebrand \nfactor (VWF). Large VWF multimers cause platelet aggregation and \ufb01 brin deposition \nin small vessels, leading to a multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy. Diagnosis: \nClinical. ADAMTS13 activity. Treatment: \ue007TTP is a haematological emergency: get \nexpert help. Plasma infusion/exchange removes antibodies/replaces ADAMTS13 and \nmay be life-saving. Corticosteroids. Consider rituximab for non-responders/relapse.\nAtherosclerotic renovascular disease\nPart of a systemic atheromatous vascular disease including cardio-, cerebro-, and \nperipheral vascular disease (ask about claudication, check foot pulses), \ue000BP, and \n\ue000lipids. Leads to renin\u2013angiotensin upregulation which causes treatment-resistant \n\ue000BP and/or a deterioration in renal function on ACE-i/ARB. Acute decompensated heart \nfailure (no LV impairment on echo) with \ufb02 ash pulmonary oedema in up to 10%. Di-\nagnosis: >1.5cm asymmetry in renal size (but \ue001sensitivity and \ue001speci\ufb01 city). Doppler \nstudies of native kidneys not consistently accurate for diagnosis. CT or MR (avoids \ncontrast) angiography. Treatment: Modi\ufb01 cation of CV risk factors: statin, aspirin, \nantihypertensive treatment. Historically, ACE-i/ARB were considered contraindicated \ndue to concern about renin\u2013dependent renal perfusion and deterioration in function \non ACE-i/ARB.

Large RCTs of medical treatment vs revascu-\nlarization have failed to show an advantage to revascularization \ue018 only considered in \n\ufb02 ash pulmonary oedema, rapid/oligo-anuric renal failure.\nScleroderma renal crisis\nOccurs in ~5% of systemic sclerosis. \ue000Risk with: diff use disease, anti-RNA polymerase \nIII antibodies and <2yr from diagnosis. Diagnosis: Accelerated hypertension (new \n>150/85mmHg) and AKI (\ue001eGFR by >30%). Biopsy: collapsed glomeruli, onion-skin \nthickening of arterioles. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB. IV vasodilators to \ue001vascular resistance \nand for digital ischaemia. Care with \ue020-blockers as \ue000HR compensating for \ue001stroke \nvolume. May recover renal function after many months.\nSickle cell nephropathy\nHbSS is associated with hyper\ufb01 ltration (lower than expected creatinine) and albumi-\nnuria. Although up to 75% of young patients will have some degree of CKD, progres-\nsion to renal failure is usually associated with another trigger, eg papillary necrosis, \ninfection. Diagnosis: Clinical. Biopsy only if looking for another diagnosis, eg AKI \nwithout clinical cause, nephrotic syndrome. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB.
