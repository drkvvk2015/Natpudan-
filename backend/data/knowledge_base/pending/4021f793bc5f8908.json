Unlike UC, there is unaff ected bowel between areas of active disease (skip \nlesions). Cause As with UC an inappropriate immune response against the (?abnor-\nmal) gut \ufb02 ora in a genetically susceptible individual.\n19 Prevalence 100\u2013200/100 000. \nIncidence 10\u201320/100 000/yr; typically presents ~20\u201340yrs. Associations Smoking \n\ue000risk \u22483\u20134; NSAIDS may exacerbate disease.\nSymptoms Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss/failure to thrive. Systemic \nsymptoms: fatigue, fever, malaise, anorexia.\nSigns Bowel ulceration (\ufb01 g 6.22); abdominal tenderness/mass; perianal abscess/\n\ufb01 stulae/skin tags; anal strictures. Beyond the gut: (\ufb01 g 6.21) Clubbing, skin, joint, & \neye problems.\nComplications Small bowel obstruction; toxic dilatation (colonic diameter >6cm, \ntoxic dilatation is rarer than in UC); abscess formation (abdominal, pelvic, or peri-\nanal); \ufb01 stulae (present in ~10%), eg entero-enteric, colovesical (bladder), colovagi-\nnal, perianal, enterocutaneous; perforation; colon cancer; PSC (p282), malnutrition.\nTests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, INR, ferritin, TIBC, B12, folate. Stool: MC&S and CDT \n(p258) to exclude eg C. dif\ufb01 cile, Campylobacter, E. coli; faecal calprotectin is a sim-\nple, non-invasive test for GI in\ufb02 ammation with high sensitivity. Colonoscopy + bi-\nopsy: Even if mucosa looks normal. Small bowel: To detect isolated proximal disease \nby eg capsule endoscopy (p248, use dummy patency capsule 1st that disintegrates if \nit gets stuck); MRI increasingly used to assess pelvic disease and \ufb01 stulae, small bowel \ndisease activity and strictures; US in skilled hands can provide small bowel imaging.\nTreatment (See BOX.8) Find out how your patient deals with what may be a brutal \ndisease (no intimacy...no sex...no hope...\u2018I live with this alone and will die alone\u2019). With \na collaborative approach, courage, attention to detail, and a dose of humour, this can \nchange. Help quit smoking. \ue007Optimize nutrition. Assess severity: \ue000T\u00b0, \ue000pulse, \ue000ESR, \n\ue000WCC, \ue000CRP, + \ue001albumin may merit admission for IV steroids.\nMild\u2013moderate: Symptomatic but systemically well. Prednisolone 40mg/d PO for \n1wk, then taper by 5mg every wk for next 7wks. An alternative dietary approach \nbased upon \u2018elemental\u2019 or \u2018polymeric\u2019 diets is eff ective in children but less used for \nadults. Plan maintenance therapy (see BOX).\nSevere: Admit for IV hydration/electrolyte replacement; IV steroids, eg hydrocorti-\nsone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h; thromboembolism prophylaxis \n(p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor T\u00b0, pulse, BP, and record stool frequency/character on a stool chart.\n  \n\u2022 Physical examination daily. Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, and plain AXR.\n  \n\u2022 Consider need for blood transfusion (if Hb <80g/L) and nutritional support.\n  \n\u2022 If improving switch to oral prednisolone (40mg/d). If not, biologics have a role.\n  \n\u2022 Consider abdominal sepsis complicating Crohn\u2019s disease especially if abdominal \npain (ultrasound, CT, & MRI are often required to assess this). Seek surgical advice.\nPerianal disease: Occurs in about 50%. MRI and examination under anaesthetic \n(EUA) are an important part of assessment. Treatment includes oral antibiotics, im-\nmunosuppressant therapy \u00b1 anti-TNF\ue025, and local surgery \u00b1 seton insertion.\n19 Much of the genetic risk is shared with UC\u2014small diff erences in genetics combined with environmental \nmodi\ufb01 ers may explain the very diff erent phenotypes.", "text_length": 3712, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 272/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 271, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.500168", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.502023", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
