Eff usions can be divided \nby their protein concentration into transudates (<25g/L) and exudates (>35g/L), see \nBOX. Blood in the pleural space is a haemothorax, pus in the pleural space is an em-\npyema, and chyle (lymph with fat) is a chylothorax. Both blood and air in the pleural \nspace is called a haemopneumothorax.\nCauses Transudates may be due to \ue000venous pressure (cardiac failure, constrictive \npericarditis, \ufb02 uid overload), or hypoproteinaemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, mal-\nabsorption). Also occur in hypothyroidism and Meigs\u2019 syndrome (right pleural eff usion \nand ovarian \ufb01 broma). Exudates are mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural cap-\nillaries secondary to infection, in\ufb02 ammation, or malignancy. Causes: pneumonia; TB; \npulmonary infarction; rheumatoid arthritis; SLE; bronchogenic carcin oma; malignant \nmetastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitis carcinomatosis.\nSymptoms Asymptomatic\u2014or dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain.\nSigns Decreased expansion; stony dull percussion note; diminished breath sounds \noccur on the aff ected side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are \ue001 (incon-\nstant and unreliable). Above the eff usion, where lung is compressed, there may be \nbronchial breathing. With large eff usions there may be tracheal deviation away \nfrom the eff usion. Look for aspiration marks and signs of associated disease: ma-\nlignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar); \nstigmata of chronic liver disease; cardiac failure; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthri-\ntis; butter\ufb02 y rash of SLE.\nTests CXR: Small eff usions blunt the costophrenic angles, larger ones are seen as \nwater-dense shadows with concave upper borders. A completely \ufb02 at horizontal up-\nper border implies that there is also a pneumothorax.\nUltrasound is useful in identifying the presence of pleural \ufb02 uid and in guiding diag-\nnostic or therapeutic aspiration.\nDiagnostic aspiration: Percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose \na site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (don\u2019t go too low or you\u2019ll be in the abdo-\nmen!). In\ufb01 ltrate down to the pleura with 5\u201310mL of 1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle \nto a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids \nneurovascular bundle). Draw off  10\u201330mL of pleural \ufb02 uid and send it to the lab for \nclinical chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amylase), bacteriology (microscopy \nand culture, auramine stain, TB culture), cytology, and, if indicated, immunology \n(rheumatoid factor, ANA, complement). See table 4.9.\nPleural biopsy: If pleural \ufb02 uid analysis is inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy. \nThoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling \ndirect visualization of the pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas).\nManagement is of the underlying cause.\n  \n\u2022 Drainage: If the eff usion is symptomatic, drain it, repeatedly if necessary. Fluid \nis best removed slowly (0.5\u20131.5L/24h). It may be aspirated in the same way as a \ndiagnostic tap, or using an intercostal drain (see p766).\n  \n\u2022 Pleurodesis with talc may be helpful for recurrent eff usions. Thorascopic mechani-\ncal pleurodesis is most eff ective for malignant eff usions. Empyemas (p170) are best \ndrained using a chest drain, inserted under ultrasound or CT guidance.\n  \n\u2022 Intra-pleural alteplase and dornase alfa may help with empyema.\n  \n\u2022 Surgery: Persistent collections and increasing pleural thickness (on ultrasound) \nrequires surgery. 50", "text_length": 3672, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 200/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 199, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.287727", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.288480", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
