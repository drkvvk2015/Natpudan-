Presentation: History of chronic \npain (headache, musculoskeletal). Often silent until advanced CKD. Diagnosis: Uri-\nnalysis: normal or sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria. USS: small and irregular kidneys. \nIVU: classic \u2018cup and spill\u2019 appearance. Non-contrast CT: \ue001renal mass, papillary cal-\nci\ufb01 cation. Biopsy: CTIN secondary to papillary necrosis. \ue000Risk of atherosclerosis. \nTreatment: Discontinue analgesia. Manage CKD (pp304\u20135). USS or CT urogram if \nsudden \ufb02 ank pain to exclude obstruction from sloughed papilla.\nAminoglycosides (gentamicin >tobramycin >amikacin >streptomycin)\nCause AKI due to tubular necrosis. Risk factors: \ue000dose, prolonged use, CKD, volume \ndepletion, other nephrotoxins. Presentation: Typically mild, non-oliguric AKI after \n1\u20132 weeks of therapy. Recovery can be delayed/incomplete. Treatment: Prevention. \nSingle daily dose may be less nephrotoxic \ue007Check levels (p756).\nRadiocontrast nephropathy\nAKI 48\u201372 hours after IV contrast. Risk factors: CKD, DM, \ue000dose of contrast, volume \ndepletion, other nephrotoxins. Treatment: None. \ue007Prevention is key: pre-hydrate \nwith IV cystalloid (no consistent bene\ufb01 t shown for bicarbonate above 0.9% sodium \nchloride). Use local protocol or consider 3mL/kg/h 1 hour before, and 1mL/kg/h for \n6h after. Acetylcysteine evidence is weak. Discontinue other nephrotoxic medication \nfor 24h pre- and post-procedure. Tell the radiologist about risk factors so they can \nuse the lowest dose of low/iso-osmolar contrast.\nRhabdomyolysis\nResults from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of intracellular contents (K\n+, \nmyoglobin) into the extracellular space. \ue000Cytokines and \ue001nitric oxide cause renal \nvasoconstriction. Myoglobin is \ufb01 ltered by the glomeruli causing obstruction and \nin\ufb02 ammation. Presentation: History of trauma, surgery, immobility, hyperthermia, \nseizures. Muscle pain, swelling, tenderness. AKI. Red-brown urine. Diagnosis: Serum \nmyoglobin: short half-life, may be missed. Plasma CK \u22485 upper limit. Myoglobinuria \n(tea- or cola-coloured urine) is falsely +ve for blood on dipstick with no RBC seen on \nmicroscopy. \ue000K\n+, \ue000\ue000PO4\n3\u03a9, \ue001Ca\n2+. Treatment: Supportive. Urgent treatment for hyper-\nkalaemia (p301). IV \ufb02 uid rehydration: maintain urine output 300mL/h until myoglobi-\nnuria has ceased; up to 1.5L \ufb02 uid/h may be needed. If oliguric, monitor CVP in HDU/ICU \nsetting. Renal replacement may be needed. (Alkalinization of urine hypothesized to \n\ue001crystallization and \ue001toxic metabolites but no RCT evidence to support use over other \ncrystalloids and beware \ue001Ca\n2+.)\nUrate nephropathy\nIn acute crystal nephropathy, uric acid crystals precipitate within the tubulointer-\nstitium causing \ue001GFR and secondary in\ufb02 ammation. Seen in tumour lysis syndrome \nwhen a high tumour burden and sensitivity to chemotherapy cause \ue000uric acid which \nprecipitates in association with \ue000phosphate. In addition, serum uric acid is a risk \nfactor for CKD: hypothesized stimulus for arterial disease with pathological autoregu-\nlation of renal blood \ufb02 ow, renin, and \ue000BP. Treatment: Tumour lysis: aggressive hy-\ndration, allopurinol/rasburicase to \ue001synthesis of uric acid. Chronic disease: unclear \nwhether diet/treatment to \ue001uric acid (allopurinol, febuxostat) improves outcome.\nRadiation nephritis\nRenal impairment due to ionizing radiation. Presents 6 months\u2013years after total body \nirradiation, local \ufb01 eld radiotherapy, or targeted radionucleotide therapy. Presents \nwith \ue000BP, proteinuria/haematuria, progression to renal failure. Prognosis linked to \ue000BP. \nTreatment: \ue001Radiation dose with shielding. As CKD (pp304\u20135) with strict BP control.\nAristolochic acid nephropathy\nHerbal remedies containing aristolochic acid can cause progressive CKD. Dispropor-\ntionate anaemia, mild proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Biopsy: extensive \ufb01 brosis \nand tubular atrophy. Risk of urothelial malignancy \u22485, occurs in up to 40%. Aris-\ntolochic acid thought to be underlying cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy: clus-\nter of CKD/renal failure in Balkan areas where aristolochic acid is detected in wheat. \nTreatment: Avoid exposure. Treat as CKD (pp304\u20135). Screen for malignancy. Consider \ntherapeutic trial of steroids (limited data).", "text_length": 4424, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 327/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 326, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.730529", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.731228", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
