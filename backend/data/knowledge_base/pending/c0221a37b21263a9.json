Any fever lasting >1wk in \nthose known to be at risk\n7 must prompt blood cultures.61 Acute infective endocarditis \n(IE) tends to occur on \u2018normal\u2019 valves and may present with acute heart failure \u00b1 emboli; \nthe commonest organism is Staph. aureus. Risk factors: skin breaches (dermatitis, IV \nlines, wounds); renal failure; immunosuppression; DM. Mortality: 5\u201350% (related to age \nand embolic events). Endocarditis on abnormal valves tends to run a subacute course. \nRisk factors: aortic or mitral valve disease; tricuspid valves in IV drug users; coarctation; \npatent ductus arteriosus; VSD; prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on prosthetic valves may \nbe \u2018early\u2019 (within 60d of surgery, usually Staph. epidermidis, poor prognosis) or \u2018late\u2019.\nCauses Bacteria: Bacteraemia occurs all the time, eg when we chew (not just during \ndentistry or medical interventions\u2014which is why routine prophylaxis for such pro-\ncedures does not make sense). 61 Strep. viridans is the commonest (usually subacute) \nfollowed by Staph. aureus, Strep. bovis (need colonoscopy ?tumour), Enterococci \nand Coxiella burnetii. Rarely: HACEK Gram \u03a9ve bacteria (Haemoph ilus\u2013Actinobacil-\nlus\u2013Cardiobact erium\u2013Eikenella\u2013Kingella); diphtheroids; Chlamydia. Fungi: Candida; \nAspergillus; Histoplasma. Usually in IV drug abusers, immunocompromised patients \nor those with prosthetic valves. High mortality, need surgical management. Other: \nSLE (Libman\u2013Sacks endocarditis); malignancy.\nSigns Septic signs: Fever, rigors, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, anaemia, \nspleno meg aly, and clubbing (\ufb01 g 3.46). Cardiac lesions: Any new murmur, or a \nchange in pre-existing murmur, should raise the suspicion of endocarditis. Vegeta-\ntions may cause valve destruction and severe regurgitation, or valve obstruction. An \naortic root abscess causes prolongation of the PR interval, and may lead to complete \nAV block. LVF is a common cause of death. Immune complex deposition: Vasculitis \n(p556) may aff ect any vessel. Microscopic haematuria is common; glomerulonephri-\ntis and acute kidney injury may occur. Roth spots (boat-shaped retinal haemorrhage \nwith pale centre); splinter haemorrhages (\ufb01 g 3.47); Osler\u2019s nodes (painful pulp in-\nfarcts in \ufb01 ngers or toes). Embolic phenomena: Emboli may cause abscesses in the \nrelevant organ, eg brain, heart, kidney, spleen, gut (or lung if right-sided IE) or skin: \ntermed Janeway lesions (\ufb01 g 3.48; painless palmar or plantar macules), which, to-\ngether with Osler\u2019s nodes, are pathognomonic.\nDiagnosis Use the Modi\ufb01 ed Duke criteria (BOX \u2018Modified Duke criteria\u2019).62, 63 Blood \ncultures: Do three sets at diff erent times from diff erent sites at peak of fever. 85\u2013\n90% are diagnosed from the 1st two sets; 10% are culture-negative. Blood tests: \nNormochromic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP. Rheumatoid factor \npositive (an immunological phenomenon). Also check U&E, Mg\n2+, LFT. Urinalysis: For \nmicroscopic haematuria. CXR: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. Regular ECGs: To \nlook for heart block. Echocardiogram: TTE (p110) may show vegetations, but only if \n>2mm. TOE (p110) is more sensitive, and better for visualizing mitral lesions and pos-\nsible development of aortic root abscess. CT: To look for emboli (spleen, brain, etc.).\nTreatment Liaise early with microbiologists and cardiologists.62 Antibiotics: see BOX \n\u2018Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis\u2019. Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular ob-\nstruction; repeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess; \nunstable infected prosthetic valve. 64\nPrognosis 50% require surgery. 20% inhospital mortality (Staphs 30%; bowel bac-\nteria 14%; Streps 6%). 15% recurrence at 2yrs.\nPrevention Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for those at risk of \nIE undergoing invasive procedures. However, if they are given antibiotics for other \nreasons during a procedure, the antibiotic should cover the common IE organisms.\nRecommendations Give clear information about prevention, including:\n  \n\u2022 The importance of maintaining good oral health.\n  \n\u2022 Symptoms that may indicate IE and when to seek expert advice.\n  \n\u2022 The risks of invasive procedures, including non-medical procedures such as body \npiercing or tattooing.65\n7 Past IE or rheumatic fever; IV drug abuser; damaged or replaced valve; PPM or ICD; structural congenital \nheart disease (but not simple ASD, fully repaired VSD, or patent ductus); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "text_length": 4623, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 158/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 157, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.127641", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.128301", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
