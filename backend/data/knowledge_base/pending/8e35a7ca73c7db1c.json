Seek a cause for each.\n\n--- Page 686 ---\n672\nClinical chemistry\nH ypernatraemia\nSigns and symptoms Lethargy, thirst, weakness, irritability, confusion, coma, and \n\ufb01 ts, along with signs of dehydration (p666). Laboratory features: \ue000Na\n+, \ue000PCV, \ue000alb, \n\ue000urea.\nCauses\nUsually due to water loss in excess of Na\n+ loss:\n  \n\u2022 Fluid loss without water replacement (eg diarrhoea, vomit, burns).\n  \n\u2022 Diabetes insipidus (p240). Suspect if large urine volume. This may follow head in-\njury, or CNS surgery, especially pituitary.\n  \n\u2022 Osmotic diuresis (for diabetic coma, see p832).\n  \n\u2022 Primary aldosteronism: rarely severe, suspect if \ue000BP, \ue001K\n+, alkalosis (\ue000HCO3\n\u03a9).\n  \n\u2022 Iatrogenic: incorrect IV \ufb02 uid replacement (excessive saline).\nManagement Give water orally if possible. If not, give glucose 5% IV slowly (1L/6h) \nguided by urine output and plasma Na\n+. Use 0.9% saline IV if hypovolaemic, since \nthis causes less marked \ufb02 uid shifts and is hypotonic in a hypertonic patient. Avoid \nhypertonic solutions.\nH yponatraemia\nPlasma Na\n+ concentration depends on the amount of both Na\n+ and water in the \nplasma. Hyponatraemia therefore does not necessarily imply Na\n+ depletion. Assess-\ning \ufb02 uid status is the key to diagnosis (see \ufb01 g 14.3).\nSigns and symptoms Look for anorexia, nausea, and malaise initially, followed by \nheadache, irritability, confusion, weakness, \ue001GCS, and seizures, depending on the se-\nverity and rate of change in serum Na\n+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indi-\ncate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls in the elderly. 3\nCauses See \ufb01 g 14.3. Artefactual causes include: \u2022blood sample was from a drip arm \n\u2022high serum lipid/protein content causing \ue000serum volume, with \ue001Na\n+ concentration \nbut normal plasma osmolality \u2022if hyperglycaemic (\ue00620mmol/L) add ~4.3mmol/L to \nplasma Na\n+ for every 10mmol/L rise in glucose above normal.\nIatrogenic hyponatraemia If 5% glucose is infused continuously without adding \n0.9% saline, the glucose is quickly used, rendering the \ufb02 uid hypotonic and causing hy-\nponatraemia, esp. in those on thiazide diuretics, women (esp. pre-menopausal), and \nthose undergoing physiological stress (eg post-operative, septic). In some patients, \nonly marginally low plasma Na\n+ levels cause serious eff ects (eg ~128mmol/L)\u2014don\u2019t \nattribute odd CNS signs to non-existent strokes/TIAS if \ue001Na\n+.\nManagement\n  \n\u2022 Correct the underlying cause; never base treatment on Na\n+ concentration alone. \nThe presence of symptoms, the chronicity of the hyponatraemia, and state of hy-\ndration are all important. Replace Na\n+ and water at the same rate they were lost.\n  \n\u2022 Asymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia, \ufb02 uid restriction is often suffi  cient if \nasymptomatic, although demeclocycline (ADH antagonist) may be required. If hy-\npervolaemic (cirrhosis, CCF), treat the underlying disorder \ufb01 rst.\n  \n\u2022 Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, or if dehydrated, cautious rehydration \nwith 0.9% saline may be given, but do not correct changes rapidly as central pontine \nmyelinolysis\n2 may result. Maximum rise in serum Na\n+ 15mmol/L per day if chronic, \nor 1mmol/L per hour if acute. Consider using furosemide when not hypovolaemic \nto avoid \ufb02 uid overload.\n  \n\u2022 Vasopressor receptor antagonists (\u2018vaptans\u2019, eg tolvaptan) promote water excre-\ntion without loss of electrolytes, and appear to be eff ective in treating hypervolae-\nmic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia but are expensive. 4\n \n\ue022In emergency: (Seizures, coma) seek expert help. Consider hypertonic saline (eg \n1.8% saline) at 70mmol Na\n+/h \u00b1 furosemide. Aim for a gradual increase in plasma \nNa\n+ to \u2248125mmol/L. Beware heart failure and central pontine myelinolysis.\n2 \n2 Central pontine myelinolysis: irreversible and often fatal pontine demyelination seen in malnourished \nalcoholics or rapid correction of \ue001Na\n+. There is subacute onset of lethargy, confusion, pseudobulbar palsy, \npara- or quadriparesis, \u2018locked-in\u2019 syndrome, or coma.", "text_length": 3974, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 680/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 679, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.336450", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.337689", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
