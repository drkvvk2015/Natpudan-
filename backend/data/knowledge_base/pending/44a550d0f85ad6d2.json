Repeat with hands laid on upper chest.\n  \n\u2022 Tactile vocal fremitus: Palpate the chest wall with \nyour \ufb01 ngertips and ask the patient to repeat \u201899\u2019, \neach time they feel your hand, comparing right to \nleft. This is rarely used.\n  \n\u2022 Percussion: Percuss over diff erent respiratory seg-\nments, comparing right and left (see \ufb01 g 2.21, p53).\n  \n\u2022 Auscultation: Ask patient to \u2018take steady breaths \nin and out through your mouth\u2019 and listen with \ndiaphragm from apices to bases, comparing right \nand left (see table 2.8, p52).\n  \n\u2022 Vocal resonance: Repeat auscultation, asking pa-\ntient to repeat \u201899\u2019 each time they feel the stetho-\nscope. If marked \ue000resonance heard, repeat with \nasking patient to whisper \u201899\u2019; if clearly heard this \nis termed \u2018whispering pectoriloquy\u2019 and is a sensi-\ntive sign for consolidation. Outside of exams, the \nchoice of vocal resonance or tactile vocal fremitus \nis a personal preference. Many clinicians prefer vo-\ncal resonance as it provides more information than \ntactile vocal fremitus.\nFig 2.20 Ankle oedema.\n  \n\u2022 Whispering pectoriloquy is a classic and speci\ufb01 c sign of consolidation.\n  \n\u2022 If you don\u2019t adequately expose the chest you may miss small scars, eg from \nvideo thoracoscopy.\n  \n\u2022 If you see Horner\u2019s syndrome, check for wasting of the small muscles of the hand; \nsee p702 and p708.\nTop tips", "text_length": 2232, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 63/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 62, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.970086", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.971012", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
