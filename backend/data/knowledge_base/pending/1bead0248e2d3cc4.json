Good for delirium and\nmay be combined with midazolam), propofol (intra\nvenous access required, may be used temporarily)\n\u0002\nETHICS\npalliative sedation is permissible when\nthe primary intention is relief of suffering, even if\nsurvival may be shortened (i.e. the doctrine of\ndouble effect)\nSPECIFIC ENTITIES\nDEATH RATTLE\ndue to patient\u2019s inability to clear\nupper respiratory secretions. Patient\u2019s family should be\nreassured that this does not indicate that the patient is\ndyspneic or in distress. Treatments to decrease respira\ntory secretions include glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg SC q4 6h\nor 0.4 1.2 mg/day SC/IV, or hyoscine hydrobromide/\nscopolamine 0.8 mg SC initially, then 0.2 0.6 mg SC\nq1h PRN, total 0.8 2 mg/day (note: hyoscine hydrobro\nmide/Scopolamine is frequently confused with hyoscine\nbutylbromide/Buscopan, which is used to relieve GI/\nbladder spasms and is dosed very differently)\nBREATHING\nPATTERN\nCHANGES\nIN\nDYING\nPATIENTS\nreassurance should be provided to the\npatient\u2019s family that breathing pattern changes\ndescribed below are not associated with dyspnea as\nthe patient is unconscious\n\u0002 CHEYNE\u2013STOKES BREATHING\ncyclic variation in rate\nand depth of breathing with apneic spells.
