Our ability to be self-aware, to think, and to reason has formed \nthe basis of scienti\ufb01 c inquiry and philosophical speculation for millennia, as we \nattempt to rationalize and de\ufb01 ne this cognitive capability. What is the mind? \nLess tangible than other aspects of our being, throughout time humans have \nlooked to explanations from philosophy, folklore, religion, and now science. The \nconcept of the sense of self and being that de\ufb01 nes us a\u00ac\u00ac\u2014whether it be called \nthe ego, nous, or the soul\u2014remains intriguing yet elusive to explain. Aristotle \nheld that the psyche (Greek: \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae=soul) was not separate to its housing body, \nas one could not exist without the other. This view was directly contradicted by \nthe 17th-century French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He proposed the theory of \n\u2018mind\u2013body dualism\u2019 in which the mind, located in the pineal gland, is an entirely \nseparate entity to the material being, and controls the avatar of the physical \nbody like a puppeteer.\nThese con\ufb02 icting viewpoints well illustrate the spectrum of neurological disease \nand its blurred boundaries with psychiatry and psychology. Jean Martin Charcot \n(1825\u20131893), often credited as the father of neurology, appeared to be more inter-\nested in this crossover than neuronal dysfunction: he spent two decades of his \ncareer studying hysteria in Paris, initially attributing symptoms of crying, fainting, \nand temporary blindness to an organic, inherited cause, before revising his view \nin later life to conclude that this was a psychological disease. His controversial \nwork in this \ufb01 eld inspired his student Sigmund Freud\u2019s psychoanalytical theories, \nand illustrated the very real power of the conscious, or sub-conscious, to produce \nphysical symptoms, a phenomenon familiar to all physicians. Perhaps re\ufb02 ecting \nour frustration with this challenging area as much as his limited success, we re-\nmember Charcot for his more tangible outputs, for example, in giving the inau-\ngural description of, among other things, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, and of course \nhis eponymous misshapen joint resulting from proprioceptive loss.\nHowever, both Aristotle and Charcot would have surely agreed with Descartes\u2019 \nproposition of \u2018cogito ergo sum\u2019: I think, therefore I am. Whether mind and brain \nare dual or one, they are inextricably linked and the very nature of awareness \nproves its existence. \nI think, therefore I am", "text_length": 2662, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 453/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 452, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.949306", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.950243", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
