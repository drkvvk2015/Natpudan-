See p752 for a guide to normal values.\nRaised levels of speci\ufb01 c enzymes can be a useful indicator of a disease. However, \nremember that most can be raised for other reasons too. Levels may be raised due \nto cellular damage, \ue000cell turnover, cellular proliferation (malignancy), enzyme induc-\ntion, and \ue001clearance. The major causes of raised enzymes:\nAlkaline phosphatase (Several distinguishable isoforms exist, eg liver and bone.)\n  \u2022 Liver disease (suggests cholestasis; also cirrhosis, abscess, hepatitis, or malignancy).\n  \n\u2022 Bone disease (isoenzyme distinguishable, re\ufb02 ects osteoblast activity) especially \nPaget\u2019s, growing children, healing fractures, bone metastases, osteomalacia, os-\nteomyelitis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism.\n  \n\u2022 Congestive cardiac failure (moderately raised).\n  \n\u2022 Pregnancy (placenta makes its own isoenzyme).\nAlanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST)\n  \n\u2022 Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).\n  \n\u2022 AST also \ue000 in MI, skeletal muscle damage (especially crush injuries), and haemolysis.\n\ue025-Amylase\n  \n\u2022 Acute pancreatitis (smaller rise in chronic pancreatitis as less tissue remaining).\n  \n\u2022 Also: severe uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe gastroenteritis, and peptic ulcer.\nCreatine kinase (CK) \ue007A raised CK does not necessarily mean an MI.\n  \n\u2022 Myocardial infarction (p118; isoenzyme \u2018CK-MB\u2019. Diagnostic if CK-MB >6% of total CK, \nor CK-MB mass >99 percentile of normal). CK returns to baseline within 48h (unlike \ntroponin, which remains raised for ~10 days), \ue018 useful for detecting re-infarction.\n  \n\u2022 Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis, p319; prolonged running; haematoma; seizures; \nIM injection; de\ufb01 brillation; bowel ischaemia; myxoedema; dermatomyositis, p552)\u2014\nand drugs (eg statins).\nGamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, \ue034GT)\n  \n\u2022 Liver disease (particularly alcohol-induced damage, cholestasis, drugs).\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\n  \n\u2022 Myocardial infarction (p118).\n  \n\u2022 Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).\n  \n\u2022 Haemolysis (esp. sickle cell crisis), pulmonary embolism, and tumour necrosis.\nTroponin\n  \n\u2022 Subtypes troponin T and troponin I are used clinically.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac damage or strain (MI\u2014p118, pericarditis, myocarditis, PE, sepsis, CPR).\n  \n\u2022 Chronic kidney disease (troponin T only; elevation less marked; aetiology unknown).", "text_length": 2469, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 696/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 695, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.366761", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.367427", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
