Aortic valve incom-\npetence, inferior MI, and cardiac arrest may develop if dissection moves proximally. \nType A (70%) dissections involve the ascending aorta, irrespective of site of the tear, \nwhile if the ascending aorta is not involved it is called type B (30%). \ue022All patients \nwith type A thoracic dissection should be considered for surgery: get urgent cardio-\nthoracic advice. De\ufb01 nitive treatment for type B is less clear and may be managed \nmedically, with surgery reserved for distal dissections that are leaking, ruptured, or \ncompromising vital organs. Management: \u2022Crossmatch 10U blood. \u2022ECG & CXR (exp-\nanded mediast inum is rare). \u2022CT or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Take \nto ITU; hypotensives: keep systolic at ~100\u2013110mmHg: labetalol (p140) or esmolol \n(t\u00bd is ultra-short) by IVI is helpful here (calcium-channel blockers may be used if \n\ue020-blockers contraindicated). Acute operative mortality: <25%.\nFig 13.52 Stenting: not an open or closed \ncase \u2026 this is a digital subtraction angiogram \nshowing correct positioning of an endovas-\ncular stent at the end of the procedure. Al-\nthough less invasive than open repair, some \nare unsuited to this method, owing to the \nanatomy of their aneurysm. Lifelong moni-\ntoring is needed: stents may leak and the an-\neurysm progress (the risk can be reduced by \ncoiling the internal iliac arteries, as shown).\nImage courtesy of Norwich Radiology Dept.", "text_length": 1843, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 663/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 662, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.312208", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.313162", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
