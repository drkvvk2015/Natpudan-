Anuria is de\ufb01 ned as \n<50mL/24h. In a catheterized patient with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage, \nwith slow decline of oliguria to anuria renal dysfunction is more likely.\nPolyuria\nIncreased urine volume, eg >3L/24h. Causes: Over-enthusiastic IV \ufb02 uid therapy; diabe-\ntes mellitus & insipidus (diabetes is Greek for fountain);\ue000Ca\n2+; psycho genic polydipsia/\nPIP syndrome (p240); polyuric phase of recovering acute tubular necrosis.\nIrritative or obstructive bladder symptoms\n(See also p642.) Symptoms of prostate enlargement are miscalled \u2018prost atism\u2019; it is \nbetter to talk about irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms, as bladder neck \nobstruction or a stricture may be the cause.\n1   Irritative bladder symptoms: Urgency, dysuria, frequency, nocturia \n6 (the last \ntwo are also associated with causes of polyuria).\n2   Obstructive symptoms: Reduced size and force of urinary stream, hesitancy and \ninterruption of stream during voiding and terminal dribbling\u2014the usual cause is \nenlargement of the prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), but other causes include \na urethral stricture, tumour, urethral valves, or bladder neck contracture. The \nmaximum \ufb02 ow rate of urine is normally ~18\u201330mL/s.\nTerminal dribbling\nDribbling at the end of urination, often seen in conjunction with incontinence follow-\ning incomplete urination, associated with prostatism.\nUrinary changes\nCloudy urine suggests pus (UTI) but is often normal phosphate precipitation in an \nalkaline urine. Pneumaturia (bubbles in urine as it is passed). Occurs with UTI due to \ngas-forming organisms or may signal an enterovesical (bowel\u2013bladder) \ufb01 stula from \ndiverticulitis, Crohn\u2019s disease or neoplastic disease of the bowel. Nocturia occurs \nwith \u2018irritative bladder\u2019, diabetes mellitus, UTI, and reversed diurnal rhythm (seen in \nrenal and cardiac failure). Haematuria (RBC in urine) is due to neoplasia or glomeru-\nlonephritis (p310) until proven otherwise. Rule out UTI.\nVoiding diffi  culty\nThis includes poor \ufb02 ow, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittent stream, incontinence \n(eg over\ufb02 ow), retention (acute or chronic), incomplete emptying (\u00b1UTI from residual \nurine). \ue007Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with over\ufb02 ow. Causes: \nObstructive: prostatic hyperplasia, early oedema after bladder neck repair, uterine \nprolapse, retroverted gravid uterus, \ufb01 broids, ovarian cysts, urethral foreign body, \nectopic ureterocele, bladder polyp, or cancer. Bladder overdistension\u2014eg after epi-\ndural for childbirth. Detrusor weakness or myopathy causes incomplete emptying \n+ dribbling over\ufb02 ow incontinence (do cystometry/electro myography; causes include \nneurological disease and interstitial cystitis (OHCS p306); it may lead to a contr acted \nbladder, eg requiring substitution enterocystoplasty). Drugs: epidural anaesthesia; \ntricyclics, anticholinergics. CNS: suprapontine (stroke); cord lesions (cord injury, mul-\ntiple sclerosis); peripheral nerve (prolapsed disc, diabetic or other neuropathy); or \nre\ufb02 ex, due to pain (eg with herpes infections).", "text_length": 3638, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 93/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 92, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.021776", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.022820", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
