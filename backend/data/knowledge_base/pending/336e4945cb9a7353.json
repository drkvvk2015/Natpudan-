Prevalence highest in \nNorthern Europe, eg UK: 10\u201320/10\n5 population. Usually aff ects adults aged 20\u201340yrs, \nmore common in women. African\u2013Caribbeans are aff ected more frequently and \nmore severely than Caucasians, particularly by extra-thoracic disease. Associated \nwith HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. For other causes of granuloma see table 4.10.\nClinical features In 20\u201340%, the disease is discovered incidentally, after a routine \nCXR, and is thus asymptomatic. Acute sarcoidosis often presents with fever, erythe-\nma nodosum (\ufb01 g 12.21, p563),\n6 polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar lymphodenopathy \n(BHL), also called L\u00f6fgren syndrome, which usually resolves spontaneously.\nPulmonary disease: 90% have abnormal CXRs with BHL (\ufb01 g 4.18) \u00b1 pulmonary in\ufb01 l-\ntrates or \ufb01 brosis; see later in topic for staging. Symptoms: Dry cough, progressive \ndyspnoea, \ue001exercise tolerance, and chest pain. In 10\u201320%, symptoms progress, with \nconcurrent deterioration in lung function.\nNon-pulmonary signs: These are legion: lymphadenopathy; hepatomegaly; sple-\nnomegaly; uveitis; conjunctivitis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; glaucoma; terminal \nphalangeal bone cysts; enlargement of lacrimal & parotid glands (\ufb01 g 8.49, p355); \nBell\u2019s palsy; neuropathy; meningitis; brainstem and spinal syndromes; space-occupy-\ning lesion; erythema nodosum (\ufb01 g 12.21, p563); lupus pernio; subcutaneous nodules; \ncardio myopathy; arrhythmias; hypercalcaemia; hypercalciuria; renal stones; pitui-\ntary dysfunction.\nTests Blood: \ue000ESR, lymphopenia, \ue000LFT, \ue000serum ACE in ~60% (non-speci\ufb01 c), \ue000Ca\n2+, \n\ue000immun oglobulins. 24h urine: \ue000Ca\n2+. CXR is abnormal in 90%: Stage 0: normal. Stage \n1: BHL. Stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary in\ufb01 ltrates. Stage 3: peripheral pulmonary \nin\ufb01 ltrates alone. Stage 4: progressive pulmonary \ufb01 brosis; bulla formation (honey-\ncombing); pleural involvement. ECG may show arrhythmias or bundle branch block. \nLung function tests may be normal or show reduced lung volumes, impaired gas \ntransfer, and a restrictive ventilatory defect. Tissue biopsy (lung, liver, lymph nodes, \nskin nodules, or lacrimal glands) is diagnostic and shows non-caseating granulo-\nmata.\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): Shows \ue000lymphocytes in active disease; \ue000neutrophils \nwith pulmonary \ufb01 brosis. Transbrochial biopsy: May be diagnostic.\nUltrasound: May show nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly.\nBone X-rays: Show \u2018punched out\u2019 lesions in terminal phalanges.\nCT/MRI: May be useful in assessing severity of pulmonary disease or diagnosing \nneurosarcoidosis. Ophthalmology assessment (slit lamp examination, \ufb02 uorescein \nangiography) is indicated in ocular disease.\nManagement \ue007Patients with BHL alone don\u2019t need treatment as most recover spon-\ntaneously.53, 54 Acute sarcoidosis: bed rest, NSAIDS.\nIndications for corticosteroids:\n  \n\u2022 Parenchymal lung disease (symptomatic, static, or progressive).\n  \n\u2022 Uveitis.\n  \n\u2022 Hypercalcaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Neurological or cardiac involvement.\nPrednisolone (40mg/24h) PO for 4\u20136 wks, then \ue001dose over 1yr according to clinical \nstatus. A few patients relapse and may need a further course or long-term therapy.\nOther therapy: In severe illness, IV methylprednisolone or immuno suppressants \n(methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide) may be needed. \nAnti-TNF\ue025 therapy may be tried in refractory cases, or lung transplantation.\nPrognosis 60% of patients with thoracic sarcoidosis resolve over 2yrs. 20% respond \nto steroid therapy; in the rest, improvement is unlikely despite therapy.\n7\n6 A detailed history and exam (including for synovitis) + CXR, 2 ASO (antistreptolysin-O) titres and a tuber-\nculin skin test are usually enough to diagnose erythema nodosum.\n7 ACE is also \ue000 in: hyperthyroidism, Gaucher\u2019s, silicosis, TB, hyper sensitivity pneumonitis, asb es tosis, pneu-\nmocystosis.55 \ue000ACE levels in CSF help diagnose CNS sarcoidosis (when serum ACE may be normal).56 ACE is lower \nin: Caucasians; and anorexia.57", "text_length": 4098, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 204/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 203, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.297688", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.298385", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
