Their needs become more \ncomplex and they become increasingly dependent. Currently, informal (mostly fam-\nily) carers of people with dementia save the UK \u00a311 billion a year. Yet this is not an \neasy task: most dementia suff erers display behavioural or psychological symptoms, \nwhich can be particularly distressing for the carer. Carer stress is inevitable and \ncauses \ue000morbidity and mortality. Ameliorate this with:\n  \n\u2022 A care coordinator (via Social Services or the local Old Age Community Mental \nHealthcare Team); vital to coordinate the various teams and services available:\n  \n\u2022 Laundry services for soiled linen\n  \n\u2022 Attendance allowance\n  \n\u2022 Car badge giving priority parking\n  \n\u2022 Respite care in hospital\n  \n\u2022 Help from occupational therapist, district \nnurses, and community psychiatric nurses\n  \u2022 Council tax rebate (forms \nfrom local council offi  ce).\n  \n\u2022 Day services can be invaluable for stimulating patients and providing regular, \nmuch-needed breaks for carers.\n  \n\u2022 Moral support Support groups, telephone helplines, and charities can all ease the \nburden, eg UK Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Society.\n  \n\u2022 Combatting challenging behaviour: First rule out pain, infection, and depres-\nsion. Then consider trazodone (50\u2013300mg at night) or lorazepam (0.5\u20131mg/12\u201324h \nPO). Haloperidol (0.5\u20134mg) can be useful in the short term. \nWho will care for the carers?", "text_length": 1668, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 495/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 494, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.024682", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.025720", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
