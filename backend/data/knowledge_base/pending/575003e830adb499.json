Cells lack the \nglycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that binds the surface proteins to cell \nmembranes. This causes uncontrolled ampli\ufb01 cation of the complement system \nand leads to destruction of the RBC membrane and release of haemoglobin into \nthe circulation (\ufb01 g 15.8). NB: the phenomenom of haemoglobinuria\n3 is not all that \nreliable. A much better test even than a marrow biopsy (right-hand panel, show-\ning a clone of PNH cells) is \ufb02 ow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored proteins on \nperipheral blood cells. This can determine the size of the PNH clone and type of GPI \nde\ufb01 ciency (complete or partial). \ue057: Most bene\ufb01 t from supportive measures\u2014but \nallogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure. Eculizumab is a monoclonal \nantibody that targets the C5 protein of the complement system. Blockade prevents \nactivation of the complement distal pathway, reducing haemolysis, stabilizing \nhaemoglobin, and reducing transfusion requirements.54\nParoxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: the darkest hour\n  \n\u2022 \ue001Inhibitions (risk taking; \ue000unsafe sex)\n  \n\u2022 Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy\n  \n\u2022 Korsakoff \u2019s syndrome\n  \n\u2022 Hepatic encephalopathy\n  \n\u2022 Cerebral atrophy (dementia)\n  \n\u2022 Central pontine myelinolysis\n  \n\u2022 Cerebellar atrophy (eg falls)\n  \n\u2022 Stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic)\n  \n\u2022 Seizures\n  \n\u2022 Marchiafava\u2013Bignami syndrome.\nAdverse eff ects of alcohol on the CNS\nFig 15.8 Urine and blood in PNH.
