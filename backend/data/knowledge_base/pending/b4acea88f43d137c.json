Also used as\ninitial workup of acute TIA or stroke and other brain\ntumors although not as sensitive as MRI\nMRI HEAD\nparticularly useful for evaluation of\nstroke (acute, subacute, chronic), hemorrhage (sub\nacute and chronic), white matter lesions (multiple\nsclerosis), and lesions of the posterior fossa, brain\nstem, and spinal cord. Also useful for most tumors,\nepilepsy, demyelinating diseases, inflammatory and\ninfectious conditions (e.g. HSV encephalitis), degen\nerative diseases, and congenital abnormalities\nMRI WITH GADOLINIUM\nimproved differentiation\nbetween pathologic and normal tissues (especially T1\nrelaxation). This increases the sensitivity and specifi\ncity. Contrast may also provide physiologic and func\ntional information in addition to lesion delineation\nCT/MR ANGIOGRAPHY\nused for evaluation of\nocclusive cerebrovascular disease, dissection, and in\nthe detection of intracerebral aneurysms as small as\n5 mm in diameter. However, cerebral angiogram\nremains the gold standard\nCT/MR VENOGRAPHY\nextremely sensitive and\nspecific in the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis\nAPPROACH TO CT HEAD\nBRAIN PARENCHYMA\n\u0002\nANY SUSPICIOUS, ASYMMETRIC LESIONS\nhypodensity\nwithin the parenchyma suggests infarction or fluid.\nHyperdensity\nrepresents\neither\nhematoma\n(hemorrhage) or calcification.
