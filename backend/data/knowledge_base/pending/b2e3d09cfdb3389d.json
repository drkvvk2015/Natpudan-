Inspect \nskin (hair loss, etc.). Look between toes and lift up heels to inspect for ulcers.\n3 Auscultation for carotid, femoral, renal iliac, \nand aortic bruits.\n4 Special tests\nBuerger\u2019s test: Lift both legs to 45\u00b0 above the horizontal, \nsupporting at heels. Allow a minute for legs to become \npale. If they do, ask patient to sit up and swing around \nto lower legs to ground\u2014observe colour change.\n5 Complete examination\nDoppler probe to detect pulses and measure ankle \u2013brachial pressure index; con-\nduct neurological examination of lower limbs.\n2 Palpation\n  \u2022 Temperature: Bilaterally in thighs, legs, and feet.\n  \n\u2022 Capillary re\ufb01 ll: Press/squeeze great toe until \nblanches, release, and measure time for colour \nto return (normal <2s).\n  \n\u2022 Peripheral pulses: Radial, bra chial (medial to \nbiceps tendon), carotid, femoral (mid-inguinal \npoint), popliteal (\ufb02 ex patient\u2019s knees slightly, \npress into centre of popliteal fossa; \ufb01 g 2.48), \nposterior tibial (just posterior & inferior to \nmedial malleolus) and dorsalis pedis (between \nbases of 1st & 2nd metatarsals, lateral to exten-\nsor hallucis longus); assess whether palpable \nbilaterally. Detect rate and rhythm. For brachial \nand carotid, determine volume and character.\n  \n\u2022 Abdominal aorta: Palpate midline above \numbilicus; position \ufb01 ngers either side of outer-\nmost palpable margins (\ufb01 g 2.49).\nFig 2.48 Peripheral pulses: pop-\nliteal.\nReproduced from Thomas J, et al.

Inspect, initially with patient standing, for \nvaricosities and skin changes.\n3 Tap test Percuss lower limit of varicosity and feel for impulse at SFJ.\n4 Auscultation Listen for bruits over any varicosities.\n5 Doppler Place probe over SFJ, squeeze calf and listen. Repeat with probe at SPJ.\n2 Palpation \u2022Temperature of varicosities. \u2022Ask patient to cough while you \npalpate for impulse at SFJ and SPJ.\n6 Tourniquet test Elevate leg and massage veins to empty varicosities. Apply \ntourniquet to upper thigh. Ask patient to stand. If not controlled, repeat, placing \ntourniquet below knee.\n7 Finish with examinations of abdomen; rectum; pelvis (\ue033); genitals (\ue032).", "text_length": 2680, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 91/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 90, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.017293", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.019447", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
