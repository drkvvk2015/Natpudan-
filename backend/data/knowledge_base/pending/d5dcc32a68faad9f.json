The latter usually requires muscle relaxation with a depolarizing/\nnon-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (OHCS p622).\n  \n\u2022 Maintenance of anaesthesia: Either a volatile agent added to N2O/O2 mixture, \nor high-dose opiates with mechanical ventilation, or IV infusion anaesthesia (eg \npropofol 4\u201312mg/kg/h IVI).\n  \n\u2022 Recovery: Change inspired gases to 100% oxygen only, then discontinue any an-\naesthetic infusions and reverse muscle paralysis. Extubate once spontaneously \nbreathing, place patient in recovery position, and give oxygen by facemask.\n  \n\u2022 For further details, see the Anaesthesia chapter in OHCS (p612).\nPrinciples and practical conduct of anaesthesia\nAnaesthetists are masters of the drug dose by weight! It is important to remem-\nber the maximum doses for local anaesthetics, not least because we use them so \nfrequently, but because the eff ects of overdose can be lethal.\nHandy to remember (though it can be worked out with a pen, paper, and SI \nunits) is that a 1% concentration is equivalent to 10mg/mL. Local anaesthetics are \nalso basic, and so do not work well in acidic environments, eg abscesses.\nTable 13.4 Example of maximum doses for local anaesthetic\n% concn\nLidocaine concn \n(mg/mL)\nApprox. allowable \nvolume (mL/kg)\nApprox. allowable volume \nfor 70kg adult (mL)\n0.25%\n2.5\n1.12\n\u226480\n0.5%\n5\n0.56\n\u226440\n1%\n10\n0.28\n\u226420\n2%\n20\n0.14\n\u226410\nLocal anaesthetic toxicity starts with peri-oral tingling and paraesthesiae, pro-\ngressing to drowsiness, seizures, coma, and cardiorespiratory arrest.
