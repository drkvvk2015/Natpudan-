These are averages: black females tend to have \nmore proximal neoplasms. White men tend to have more distal neoplasms.\nPolyps are growths that appear above the mucosa and can be in\ufb02 ammatory, \nhamartomatous, or neoplastic. Left in situ, polyps carry a risk of malignant trans-\nformation that will relate to size and histology (tubular or villous adenomas, esp. \nif >2cm). Patients with polyps may have no symptoms and thus a colonoscopy is \nrequired to detect and remove. Colonscopy allows the opportunity to detect colo-\nrectal cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more eff ective.\nHowever, population-based colonoscopic screening is costly and some studies \nhave suggested that the test does not impact on deaths from right-sided can-\ncers which are rarer and harder to detect (\ufb01 g 13.34). Therefore, the NHS has intro-\nduced a one-off  screening \ufb02 exible sigmoidoscopy off ered to all people in their 55th \nyear. Trial results have shown the incidence of colorectal cancer in the intervention \n(screening) group is reduced by 33% and mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced \nby 43%. Number needed to screen to prevent one diagnosis (=191); or death (=489). \nIn parallel, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (introduced in 2006) of-\nfers colonoscopy to all men and women aged 60\u201375 who test positive for faecal \noccult blood (FOB) using a home testing kit performed every 2 years. This FOB-\nstrati\ufb01 cation targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting \ndetection of more advanced adenomas and early stage cancers. The relative risk \nof death from colorectal cancer in patients undergoing screening is reduced by \n16%. A 11% increase in incidence rates since 2006 for people aged 60\u201369 is almost \ncertainly due to earlier detection through the screening programme. \nPolyps, the challenges of screening, and the NHS\nSplenic \ufb02exure 2%\nHepatic \ufb02exure 3%\nAscending colon 7%\nCaecum 14%\nAppendix 1%\nAnus 2%\nDescending colon 3%\n Transverse colon 5%\nSigmoid colon 20%\nRectum 27%\nOther and unspeci\ufb01ed 9%\nRight side\nLeft side\nTable 13.13 Colorectal cancer: TNM staging\nTx\nPrimary tumour cannot be assessed\nNx\nNodes cannot be assessed\nTis\nCarcinoma in situ\nN0\nNo node spread\nT1\nInvading submucosa\nN1\nMetastases in 1\u20133 regional nodes\nT2\nInvading muscularis propria\nN2\nMetastases in >3 regional nodes\nT3\nInvading subserosa and beyond (not \nother organs)\nM0\nNo distant spread\nT4\nInvasion of adjacent structures\nM1\nDistant metastasis\nReproduced with permission from Edge, SB et al.
