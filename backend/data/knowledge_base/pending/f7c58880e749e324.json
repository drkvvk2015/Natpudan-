It includes diff erent \naetiologies and may be multifactorial.\nDiff erent de\ufb01 nitions of AKI exist. In 2012, there was an attempt to amalgamate \ndiff erent diagnostic criteria into a single de\ufb01 nition and staging system. The Kidney \nDiseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines2 de\ufb01 ne AKI as:\n  \n\u2022 rise in creatinine >26\u03bcmol/L within 48h.\n  \n\u2022 rise in creatinine >1.5 \u2248 baseline (ie before the AKI) within 7 days.\n  \n\u2022 urine output <0.5mL/kg/h for >6 consecutive hours.\nThe severity of AKI is then staged according to the highest creatinine rise or longest \nperiod/severity of oliguria (table 7.3).\nTable 7.3 KDIGO staging system for AKI\nStage\nSerum creatinine\nUrine output\n1\n>26.5\u03bcmol/L (0.3mg/dL) or\n1.5\u20131.9 \u2248 baseline\n<0.5mL/kg/h for 6\u201312h\n2\n2.0\u20132.9 \u2248 baseline\n<0.5mL/kg/h for >12h\n3\n>353.6\u03bcmol/L (4.0mg/dL) or\n>3.0 \u2248 baseline or\nrenal replacement therapy\n<0.3mL/kg/h for >24h or\nanuria for >12h\nAlthough there are limitations to the use of serum creatinine, including the eff ects \nof muscle mass and dilution, no other biomarker has been able to supersede it (yet). \nThe clinical approach to AKI is shown in \ufb01 g 7.3.3\nEpidemiology\nAKI is common, occurring in up to 18% of hospital patients and ~50% of ICU patients. \nRisk factors for AKI include pre-existing CKD, age, male sex, and comorbidity (DM, \ncardiovascular disease, malignancy, chronic liver disease, complex surgery).\nCauses\nCommonest causes:\n1   Sepsis.\n2   Major surgery.\n3   Cardiogenic shock.\n4   Other hypovolaemia.\n5   Drugs.\n6   Hepatorenal syndrome.\n7   Obstruction.\nAetiology can be divided according to site (table 7.4) as:\n  \n\u2022 pre-renal: \ue001perfusion to the kidney.\n  \n\u2022 renal: intrinsic renal disease.\n  \n\u2022 post-renal: obstruction to urine.\nTable 7.4 Aetiology of AKI\nWhere?\nPathology\nExample\nPre-renal\n\ue001Vascular volume\nHaemorrhage, D&V, burns, pancreatitis\n\ue001Cardiac output\nCardiogenic shock, MI\nSystemic vasodilation\nSepsis, drugs\nRenal vasoconstriction\nNSAIDs, ACE-i, ARB, hepatorenal syndrome\nRenal\nGlomerular (pp310\u201313)\nGlomerulonephritis, ATN (prolonged renal hypo-\nperfusion causing intrinsic renal damage)\nInterstitial (p318)\nDrug reaction, infection, in\ufb01 ltration (eg sarcoid)\nVessels (pp314\u20135)\nVasculitis, HUS, TTP, DIC \nPost-renal\nWithin renal tract\nStone, renal tract malignancy, stricture, clot\nExtrinsic compression\nPelvic malignancy, prostatic hypertrophy, retro-\nperitoneal \ufb01 brosis", "text_length": 2673, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 306/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 305, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.697204", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.697769", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
