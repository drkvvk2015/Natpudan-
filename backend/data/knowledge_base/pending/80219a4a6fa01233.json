NB: don\u2019t use this image for identi\ufb01 cation!\nIn the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by hepatocytes, making \nit water-soluble. Conjugated bilirubin is secreted in bile and passes into the gut. \nSome is taken up again by the liver (via the enterohepatic circulation) and the rest \nis converted to urobilinogen by gut bacteria. Urobilinogen is either reabsorbed and \nexcreted by the kidneys, or converted to stercobilin, which colours faeces brown.\nThe pathway of bilirubin metabolism\nFig 6.25 Bilirubin is formed by the \nbreakdown of haemoglobin in a \n3-step process: hepatic uptake, con-\njugation, and excretion.\nFig 6.24 It\u2019s easy to miss mild jaundice, especially under \ufb02 uo-\nrescent light, so take your patient to the window, and as you \nboth gaze at the sky, use the opportunity to broaden the hori-\nzons of your enquiries ... where have you been ... where are you \ngoing ...who are you with ... what are you taking ...?
