Type 2 (immune) starts between\ndays 4 and 14. It is usually more severe (platelet\ndrop >50%) and has great clinical significance. The\npathogenesis is as follows: heparin complexes with\nPF4 (from platelets) ! IgG against heparin PF4\ncomplex ! these megacomplexes bind to plate\nlets and activate them, producing more PF4 !\nplatelet aggregation ! thrombosis\n\u0002\nCAUSES\nheparin, LMWH (much less likely)\n\u0002\nCLINICAL\nFEATURES (type II)\nthrombocytopenia,\nthrombosis, ischemia\n\u0002\nTREATMENTS (type II)\nstop heparin. If patient has\nindication for anticoagulation (acute thrombosis,\natrial fibrillation), consider danaparoid, lepirudin,\nargatroban. Since the risk of thrombosis due to HITT\napproaches 50%, one should also consider primary\nprophylaxis with these agents until platelets return\nto normal. If both HITT and DVT, avoid warfarin until\nplatelets >150\u0003103/mL and overlap warfarin with\nthe alternative anticoagulant for 5 days (this reduces\nrisk of venous limb gangrene).
