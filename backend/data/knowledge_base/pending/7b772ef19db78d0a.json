The main known risk factor is \nsmoking. The eye disease may not correlate with thyroid disease and the patient \ncan be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid at presentation. Eye disease may \nbe the \ufb01 rst presenting sign of Graves\u2019 disease, and can also be worsened by treat-\nment, typically with radioiodine (usually a transient eff ect). Retro-orbital in\ufb02 am-\nmation and lymphocyte in\ufb01 ltration results in swelling of the orbit.\nSymptoms Eye discomfort, grittiness, \ue000tear production, photophobia, diplopia, \n\ue001acuity, aff erent pupillary defect (p72) may mean optic nerve compression: \ue007Seek \nexpert advice at once as decompression may be needed. Nerve damage does not \nnecessarily go hand-in-hand with protrusion. Indeed, if the eye cannot protrude \nfor anatomical reasons, optic nerve compression is more likely\u2014a paradox!\nSigns Exophthalmos\u2014appearance of protruding eye; proptosis\u2014eyes protrude \nbeyond the orbit (look from above in the same plane as the forehead); conjunctival \noedema; corneal ulceration; papilloedema; loss of colour vision. Ophth almoplegia \n(especially of upward gaze) occurs due to muscle swelling and \ufb01 brosis.\nTests Diagnosis is clinical. CT/MRI of the orbits may reveal enlarged eye muscles.\nManagement Get specialist help. Treat hyper- or hypothyroidism. Advise to stop \nsmoking (worse prognosis). Most have mild disease that can be treated sympto-\nmatically (arti\ufb01 cial tears, sunglasses, avoid dust, elevate bed when sleeping to \n\ue001periorbital oedema). Diplopia may be managed with a Fresnel prism stuck to one \nlens of a spectacle (aids easy changing as the exophthalmos changes). In more se-\nvere disease, try high-dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone is better than predniso-\nlone 100mg/day PO)18\u2014decreasing according to symptoms. Surgical decomp ression \nis used for severe sight-threatening disease, or for cosmetic reasons once the activ-\nity of eye disease has reduced (via an inferior orbital approach, using space in the \nethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses). Eyelid surgery may improve cosmesis \nand function. Orbital radiotherapy can be used to treat ophthalmoplegia but has lit-\ntle eff ect on proptosis. Future options: Anti-TNF\ue025 antibodies (eg in\ufb02 iximab).\nThyroid eye disease\nFig 5.14 Thyroid eye dis-\nease: lid retraction causing a \n\u2018staring\u2019 appearance.\nFig 5.15 Goitre.\n*Emotional or tactile stimuli cause spasms; seen in any autoimmune state (eg type 1 DM); \ue014: baclofen\u00b1 IV Ig.\nTable 5.3 Manifestations of Graves\u2019 disease\u2014and pathophysiology\nPituitary\nSuppressed TSH\n\ue001Expression of thyrotropin \ue020 subunit\nHeart\n\ue000Rate; \ue000contractility\n\ue000Serum atrial natriuretic peptide\nLiver\n\ue000Peripheral T3; LDL\ue001 (p690)\n\ue000Type 1 5\u2019-deiodinase; LDL receptors\nBone\n\ue000Bone turnover; osteoporosis\n\ue000Osteocalcin; \ue000ALP; \ue000urinary N-telopeptide\nGenital \ue032\n\ue001Libido; erectile dysfunction\n\ue000Sex hormone globulin; \ue001testosterone\nGenital \ue033\nIrregular menses\nOestrogen antagonism\nMetabolic\n\ue000Thermogenesis; \ue000O2 use\n\ue000Fatty acid oxidation; \ue000Na-K ATPase\nWhite fat\n\ue001Fat mass\n\ue000Adrenergic-mediated lipolysis\nCNS \nStiff  person syndrome (rare)* Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase\nMuscle\nProximal myopathy\n\ue000Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\n2+-activated ATPase\nThyroid\n\ue000Secretion of T3 and T4\n\ue000Type 2 5\u2019-deiodinase activity in thyroid\nDiffuse\n  \n\u2022 Physiological\n  \n\u2022 Graves\u2019 disease\n  \n\u2022 Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis\n  \n\u2022 Subacute (de Quervain\u2019s) \nthyroiditis (painful).\nNodular\n  \n\u2022 Multinodular goitre\n  \n\u2022 Adenoma\n  \n\u2022 Carcinoma.\nCauses of goitre", "text_length": 3587, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 227/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 226, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.373974", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.374874", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
