Minimal trauma to the leg leads to ulceration which often takes many months \nto heal. Ulcers on the sacrum, greater trochanter, or heel suggest pressure sores \n(OHCS p604), particularly if the patient is bed-bound with suboptimal nutrition.\nTemperature The ulcer and surrounding tissues are cold in an ischaemic ulcer. If \nthe skin is warm and well perfused then local factors are more likely.\nSurface area Draw a map of the area to quantify and time any healing (a wound \n>4wks old is a chronic ulcer as distinguished from an acute wound).\nShape Oval, circular (cigarette burns), serpiginous (Klebsiella granulomatis, p412); \nunusual morphology can be secondary to mycobacterial infection, eg cutaneous \ntuberculosis or scrofuloderma (tuberculosis colliquativa cutis, where an infected \nlymph node ulcerates through to the skin).\nEdge Shelved/sloping \u2248 healing; punched-out \u2248 ischaemic or syphilis; rolled/evert-\ned \u2248 malignant; undermined \u2248 TB.\nBase Any muscle, bone, or tendon destruction (malignancy; pressure sores; is-\nchaemia)? There may be a grey-yellow slough, beneath which is a pale pink base. \nSlough is a mixture of \ufb01 brin, cell breakdown products, serous exudate, leucocytes, \nand bacteria\u2014it need not imply infection, and can be part of the normal wound \nhealing process. Granulation tissue is a deep pink gel-like matrix contained within \na \ufb01 brous collagen network and is evidence of a healing wound.\nDepth If not uncomfortable for the patient (eg in neuropathic ulceration), a probe \ncan be used to gauge how deep the ulceration extends.\nDischarge Culture before starting any antibiotics (which usually don\u2019t work). A \nwatery discharge is said to favour TB; \ue007bleeding can \u2248 malignancy.\nAssociated lymphadenopathy Suggests infection or malignancy.\nSensation Decreased sensation around the ulcer implies neuropathy.\nPosition in phases of extension/healing Healing is heralded by granulation, \nscar formation, and epithelialization.
