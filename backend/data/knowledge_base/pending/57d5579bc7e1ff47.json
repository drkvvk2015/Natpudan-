Thirst, thermal regulation, \nappetite, sleep cycles, menstrual cycle, and stress/mood are all controlled by the \nhypothalamus. Releasing factors produced by the hypothalamus reach the pituitary \nvia the portal system (pituitary stalk), see \ufb01 g 5.3. The releasing factors stimulate or \ninhibit the production of hormones from the anterior pituitary, \ufb01 g 5.4. Vasopressin \nand oxytocin are produced in the hypothalamus and stored and released from the \nposterior pituitary.\nFig 5.3 Hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\nPosterior pituitary\nOxytocin\nOvaries and \ntestes\nMany \ntissues\nBreasts/\ngonads\nAdrenals\nGH\nTSH\nACTH\nThyroid\nRenal \ntubules\nBreasts/\nuterus\nProlactin\nTestosterone/\noestrogens\nThyroxine\nLactation\nSteroids\nAnterior pituitary\nVasopressin\nLH/FSH\nHypothalamus\nReleasing factors", "text_length": 1476, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 212/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 211, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.322634", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.323524", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
