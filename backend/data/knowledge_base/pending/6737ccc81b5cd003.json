Stool: Sudan stain for fat globules; stool microscopy (infestation); \nelastase. Breath hydrogen analysis: For bacterial overgrowth.\n20 Take samples of end-\nexpired air; give glucose; take more samples at \u00bdh intervals; early \ue000exhaled hydrogen \n= overgrowth. Endoscopy + small bowel biopsy.\nInfectious malabsorption Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Isospora belli, Cyclospora \ncayetanensis, microsporidia. Tropical sprue: Villous atrophy + malabsorption occur-\nring in the Far and Middle East and Caribbean\u2014the cause is unknown. Tetracycline \n250mg/6h PO + folic acid 5mg/d PO for 3\u20136mnths may help. \nCoeliac disease\n\ue007Suspect this if diarrhoea + weight loss or anaemia (esp. if iron or B12 \ue001). T-cell-\nresponses to gluten (alcohol-soluble proteins in wheat, barley, rye \u00b1 oats) in the small \nbowel causes villous atrophy and malabsorption. Associations HLA DQ2 in 95%; the \nrest are DQ8; autoimmune disease; dermatitis herpetiformis. Prevalence 1 in 100\u2013300 \n(commoner if Irish). Any age (peaks in childhood and 50\u201360yrs). \ue033:\ue032 >1:1. Relative \nrisk in 1st-degree relatives is 6\u2248.\nPresentation Stinking stools/steatorrhoea; diarrhoea; abdominal pain; bloating; nau-\nsea + vomiting; aphthous ulcers; angular stomatitis (p327, \ufb01 g 8.5); \ue001weight; fatigue; \nweakness; osteomalacia; failure to thrive (children). ~30% less severe: may mimic IBS.\nDiagnosis \ue001Hb; \ue000RCDW (p325); \ue001B12, \ue001ferritin. Antibodies: anti-transglutaminase is \nsingle preferred test (but is an IgA anti body\u2014check IgA levels to exclude subclass de\ufb01 -\nciency). Where serology positive or high index of suspicion proceed to duodenal biopsy \nwhile on a gluten-containing diet: expect subtotal villous atrophy, \ue000intra-epithelial WBCS \n+ crypt hyperplasia. Where doubt persists, HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping may help.\nTreatment Lifelong gluten-free diet\u2014patients become experts. Rice, maize, soya, \npotatoes, and sugar are OK. Limited consumption of oats (\u226450g/d) may be toler-\nated in patients with mild disease. Gluten-free biscuits, \ufb02 our, bread, and pasta are \nprescribable. Monitor response by symptoms and repeat serology.9\nComplications Anaemia; dermatitis herpetiformis (OHCS p588); osteopenia/os-\nteoporosis; hyposplenism (off er \u2018\ufb02 u and pneumococcal vaccinations); GI T-cell \nlymphoma (rare; suspect if refractory symptoms or \ue001weight); \ue000 risk of malignancy \n(lymphoma, gastric, oesophageal, colorectal); neuropathies.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nIBS denotes a mixed group of abdominal symptoms for which no organic cause can \nbe found. Most are probably due to disorders of intestinal motility, enhanced visceral \nperception (the \u2018brain\u2013gut\u2019 axis: see BOX \u2018Managing IBS\u2019), or microbial dysbiosis. Sev-\neral diagnostic criteria exist (see BOX \u2018De\ufb01 ning gastrointestinal dysfunction\u2019 p261). \n Prevalence 10\u201320%; age at onset: \ue00540yrs; \ue033:\ue032 \u22652:1.\nDiagnosis Only diagnose IBS if recurrent abdominal pain (or discomfort) associated \nwith at least 2 of: \u2022 relief by defecation \u2022 altered stool form \u2022 altered bowel frequen-\ncy (constipation and diarrhoea may alternate). Other features: urgency; incomplete \nevacuation; abdominal bloating/distension; mucus PR; worsening of symptoms after \nfood. Symptoms are chronic (>6 months), and often exacerbated by stress, men-\nstruation, or gastroenteritis (post-infectious IBS). Signs: Examination may be nor-\nmal, but general abdominal tenderness is common. Insuffl  ation of air during lower \nGI endoscopy (not usually needed) may reproduce the pain. Think of other diagnoses \nif: Age >60yrs; history <6 months; anorexia; \ue001weight; waking at night with pain/diar-\nrhoea; mouth ulcers; abnormal CRP, ESR.", "text_length": 4118, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 274/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 273, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.510219", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.511411", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
