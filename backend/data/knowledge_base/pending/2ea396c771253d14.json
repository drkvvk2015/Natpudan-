Hyperglycae-\nmia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious \nmicrovascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems: \nstroke, MI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia. So think of DM as a vascular dis-\nease:\n1 adopt a holistic approach and consider other cardiovascular risk factors too.\nCategories of diabetes and dyslipidaemia\nType 1 DM: Usually adolescent onset but may occur at any age. Cause: insulin de-\n\ufb01 ciency from autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic \ue020 cells. Pa-\ntients must have insulin, and are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss. Associated \nwith other autoimmune diseases (>90% HLA DR3 \u00b1 DR4). Concordance is only ~30% in \nidentical twins, indic ating environmental in\ufb02 uence. Four genes are important: one \n(6q) determines islet sensitivity to damage (eg from viruses or cross-reactivity from \ncows\u2019 milk-induced antibodies). Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a \nform of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.\nType 2 DM: (Formerly non-insulin-dependent DM, NIDDM) is at \u2018epidemic\u2019 levels in many \nplaces, mainly due to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and \nimproved long evity.4 Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%). \nMost are over 40yrs, but teenagers are now getting type 2 DM (OHCS p156). Cause: \n\ue001insulin secretion \u00b1 \ue000insulin resistance. It is associated with obesity, lack of exercise, \ncalorie and alcohol excess. \ue00680% concordance in identical twins, indicating stronger \ngenetic in\ufb02 uence than in type 1 DM. Typically progresses from a preliminary phase of \nimpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). (\ue007This is a unique \nwindow for lifestyle intervention.) Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a \nrare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM aff ecting young people.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT): Fasting plasma glucose <7mmol/L and OGTT (oral \nglucose tolerance) 2h glucose \u22657.8mmol/L but <11.1mmol/L.\nImpaired fasting glucose (IFG): Fasting plasma glucose \u2265 6.1mmol/L but <7mmol/L \n(WHO criteria). Do an OGTT to exclude DM. The cut-off  point is somewhat arbitrary.\nIGT and IFG denote diff erent abnormalities of glucose regulation (post-prandial and \nfasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both \nwith lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG and HbA1C at high \nend of normal (37\u201346mmol/mol) is ~25%.5\nOther causes of DM \ue007Steroids; anti-HIV drugs; newer antipsychotics. \n  \n\u2022 Pancreatic: pancreatitis; surgery (where >90% pancreas is removed); trauma; \npancreatic destruction (haemochromatosis, cystic \ufb01 brosis); pancreatic cancer.\n  \n\u2022 Cushing\u2019s disease; acromegaly; phaeochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; pregnancy.\n  \n\u2022 Others: congenital lipodystrophy; glycogen storage diseases.\nMetabolic syndrome (syndrome x) De\ufb01 nition from International Diabetes Federa-\ntion: central obesity (BMI >30, or \ue000 waist circ, ethnic-speci\ufb01 c values), plus two of BP \u2265130/85, \ntriglycerides \u22651.7mmol/L, HDL \u2264 1.03\ue032/1.29\ue033mmol/L, fasting glucose \u22655.6mmol/L or \ntype 2 DM. ~20% are aff ected; weight, genetics, and insulin resistance important in aetiol-\nogy. Vascular events\u2014but probably not beyond the combined eff ect of individual risk \nfactors. \ue057: Exercise; \ue001weight; treat individual components.\n1 Chicken or egg? Most type 2 diabetes-associated genes have a function in the vasculature, and str ess in \n\ue020-cells can result from vascular defects in the pancreas, so maybe vascular events trigger DM.6", "text_length": 3793, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 214/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 213, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.330789", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.331479", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
