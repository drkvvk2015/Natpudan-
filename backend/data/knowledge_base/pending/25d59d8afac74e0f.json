Antoni van \nLeeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723) was an unlikely scholar: \na draper with no academic education. He mixed \nuncomfortably in a scienti\ufb01 c world made up of \nthose better educated, wealthier, and with more \nre\ufb01 ned manners. He felt unworthy of publication \nbut submitted hundreds of letters to the Royal \nSociety, always asking his readers to account for \nhis humble origins. Despite his self-deprecation, \nhis microscopy was sophisticated. His surviv-\ning lens magni\ufb01 ed \u2248266 and resolved down to \n1.35\u03bcm, comparable to that of a modern com-\npound microscope. With it he gained one of the \n\ufb01 rst insights into the \u2018invisible\u2019 living creatures \nof the microscopic world. His microscopes were \ncheap and easy to produce\u2014he made 500 for his \npersonal use. He plated them in gold and silver to \nadd a prestige that the scienti\ufb01 c world felt they \nlacked. But that world failed to see beyond the \nend of its turned up nose. Bloodletting, purging, \nand emetics would continue to fail patients for a \nfurther 150 years.\nWe thank Dr Chris Conlon, our Specialist Reader for this chapter.", "text_length": 2325, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 386/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 385, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.832363", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.833139", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
