Lung damage and release of in\ufb02 ammatory mediators cause \nincreased capillary permeability and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, often ac-\ncompanied by multiorgan failure.\nCauses Pulmonary: Pneumonia; gastric aspiration; inhalation; injury; vasculitis \n(p556); contusion. Other: Shock; septicaemia; haemorrhage; multiple transfusions; \nDIC (p352); pancreatitis; acute liver failure; trauma; head injury; malaria; fat embo-\nlism; burns; obstetric events (eclampsia; amniotic \ufb02 uid embolus); drugs/toxins (as-\npirin, heroin, paraquat).\nClinical features Cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; peripheral vasodilation; bilat-\neral \ufb01 ne inspiratory crackles. Investigations FBC, U&E, LFT, amylase, clotting, CRP, \nblood cultures, ABG. CXR shows bilateral pulmonary in\ufb01 ltrates. Pulmonary artery \ncatheter to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).\nDiagnostic criteria One consensus requires these four to exist:45 1 Acute onset. \n2 CXR: bilateral in\ufb01 ltrates (\ufb01 g 4.15). 3 PCWP <19mmHg or a lack of clinical congestive \nheart failure. 4 Refractory hypoxaemia with PaO2: FiO2 <200 for ARDS. Others include \ntotal thoracic compliance <30mL/cmH2O.\nManagement Admit to ITU; give supportive therapy; treat the under lying cause.\n  \n\u2022 Respiratory support: In early ARDS, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) \nwith 40\u201360% oxygen may be adequate to maintain oxygenation. But most patients \nneed mechanical ventilation. Indications for ventilation: PaO2: <8.3kPa despite 60% \nO2; PaCO2: >6kPa. The large tidal volumes (10\u201315mL/kg) produced by conventional \nventilation plus reduced lung compliance in ARDS may lead to high peak airway pres-\nsures \u00b1 pneumothorax. A low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either \nlow or moderate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improves outcome.\n  \n\u2022 Circulatory support: Invasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and \nSwan\u2013Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and \ncardiac output. A conservative \ufb02 uid management approach improves outcome. \nMaintain cardiac output and O2 delivery with inotropes (eg dobutamine 2.5\u201310mcg/\nkg/min IVI), vasodilators, and blood transfusion. Consider treating pulmonary hyper-\ntension with low-dose (20\u2013120 parts per million) nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodila-\ntor. Haemo \ufb01 ltration may be needed in renal failure and to achieve a negative \ufb02 uid \nbalance. 46, 49\n  \n\u2022 Sepsis: Identify organism(s) and treat. If septic, but no organisms cultured, use \nempirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (p167). Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics.\n  \n\u2022 Other: Nutritional support: enteral is best: p584 & p586, with high-fat, antioxidant \nformulations. Steroids protect those at risk of fat embolization and with pneumo-\ncystosis and may improve outcome in subacute ARDS. Their role in established ARDS \nis controversial. 50, 51\nPrognosis Overall mortality is 50\u201375%. Prognosis varies with age of patient, cause \n(pneumonia 86%, trauma 38%), and number of organs involved (three organs in-\nvolved for >1wk is \u2018invariably\u2019 fatal).", "text_length": 3803, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 194/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 193, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.272279", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.273131", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
