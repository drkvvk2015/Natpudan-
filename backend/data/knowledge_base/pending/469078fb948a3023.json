Peak incidence: 5\u201315yrs. Tends to recur unless prevented. Pharyngeal \ninfection with Lance\ufb01 eld group A \ue020-haemolytic streptococci triggers rheumatic fe-\nver 2\u20134wks later, in the susceptible 2% of the population. An antibody to the car-\nbohydrate cell wall of the streptococcus cross-reacts with valve tissue (antigenic \nmimicry) and may cause permanent damage to the heart valves.\nDiagnosis Use the revised Jones criteria (may be over-rigorous). There must be \nevidence of recent strep infection plus 2 major criteria, or 1 major + 2 minor.\nEvidence of group A \ue058-haemolytic streptococcal infection:\n  \n\u2022 Positive throat culture (usually negative by the time RF symptoms appear).\n  \n\u2022 Rapid streptococcal antigen test +ve.\n  \n\u2022 Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titre (eg anti-streptolysin O (ASO) or \nDNase B titre).\n  \n\u2022 Recent scarlet fever.\nMajor criteria:\n  \n\u2022 Carditis: tachycardia, murmurs (mitral or aortic regurgitation, Carey Coombs\u2019 \nmurmur, p46), pericardial rub, CCF, cardiomegaly, conduction defects (45\u201370%). An \napical systolic murmur may be the only sign.52\n  \n\u2022 Arthritis: a migratory, \u2018\ufb02 itting\u2019 polyarthritis; usually aff ects larger joints (75%).\n  \n\u2022 Subcutaneous nodules: small, mobile, painless nodules on extensor surfaces of \njoints and spine (2\u201320%).\n  \n\u2022 Erythema marginatum: (\ufb01 g 3.42) geographical-type rash with red, raised edges \nand clear centre; occurs mainly on trunk, thighs and arms in 2\u201310% (p562).\n  \n\u2022 Sydenham\u2019s chorea (St Vitus\u2019 dance): occurs late in 10%. Unilateral or bilateral \ninvoluntary semi-purposeful movements. May be preceded by emotional lability \nand uncharacteristic behaviour. \nMinor criteria:\n  \n\u2022 Fever.\n  \n\u2022 Raised ESR or CRP.\n  \n\u2022 Arthralgia (but not if arthritis is one of the major criteria).\n  \n\u2022 Prolonged PR interval (but not if carditis is major criterion).\n  \n\u2022 Previous rheumatic fever.\nManagement\n  \n\u2022 Bed rest until CRP normal for 2wks (may be 3 months).\n  \u2022 Benzylpenicillin 0.6\u20131.2g IV stat, then phenoxymethylpenicillin 250\u2013500mg 4 times daily \nPO for 10 days (if allergic to penicillin, give erythromycin or azithromycin for 10 days). \n  \u2022 Analgesia for carditis/arthritis: aspirin 100mg/kg/d PO in divided doses (max 4\u20138g/d) \nfor 2d, then 70mg/kg/d for 6wks. Monitor salicylate level. Toxicity causes tinnitus, \nhyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. Risk of Reye syndrome in children. Alterna-\ntive: NSAIDS (p546). If moderate-to-severe carditis is present (cardiomegaly, CCF, or \n3rd-degree heart block), add oral prednisolone to salicylate therapy. In case of heart \nfailure, treat appropriately (p136), with severe valve disease, surgery may be required.\n  \n\u2022 Immobilize joints in severe arthritis.\n  \n\u2022 Haloperidol (0.5mg/8h PO) or diazepam for the chorea.\nPrognosis 60% with carditis develop chronic rheumatic heart disease. This cor-\nrelates with the severity of the carditis. 53 Acute attacks last an average of 3 months. \nRecurrence may be precipitated by further streptococcal infections, pregnancy, or \nuse of the oral contraceptive pill. Cardiac sequelae aff ect mitral (70%), aortic (40%), \ntricuspid (10%), and pulmonary (2%) valves. Incompetent lesions develop during the \nattack, stenoses years later.\nSecondary prophylaxis Penicillin V 250mg/12h PO. Alternatives: sulfadiazine 1g dai-\nly (0.5g if <30kg) or erythromycin 250mg twice daily (if penicillin allergic). Duration: \nIf carditis+persistent valvular disease, continue at least until age of 40 (sometimes \nlifelong). If carditis but no valvular disease, continue for 10yrs. If there is no carditis, \n5yrs of prophylaxis (until age of 21) is suffi  cient.", "text_length": 3831, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 150/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 149, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.114813", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.115601", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
