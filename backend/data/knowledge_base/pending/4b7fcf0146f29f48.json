Titrate the amount guided by the patient\u2019s SaO2 and \nclinical condition. Humidi\ufb01 cation is only required for longer-term delivery of O2 at \nhigh \ufb02 ow rates and tracheostomies, but may \ue000 expectoration in bronchiectasis.\nNasal cannulae: Preferred by patients, but O2 delivery is relatively imprecise and \nmay cause nasal soreness. The \ufb02 ow rate (1\u20134L/min) roughly de\ufb01 nes the concentra-\ntion of O2 (24\u201340%). May be used to maintain SaO2 when nebulizers need to be run \nusing air, eg COPD.\nSimple face mask: Delivers a variable amount of O2 depending on the rate of \nin\ufb02 ow. Less precise than venturi masks\u2014so don\u2019t use if hypercapnia or type II \nrespiratory failure. Risk of CO2 accumulation (within the mask and so in inspired \ngas) if \ufb02 ow rate <5L/min. \ue007Be careful in those with COPD (p812).\nVenturi mask: Provides a precise percentage or fraction of O2 (FiO2) at high \ufb02 ow \nrates. Start at 24\u201328% in COPD. Colours of masks:\nBLUE = 24%,  WHITE  = 28%, YELLOW = 35%, RED = 40%, GREEN = 60%.\nNon-rebreathing mask: These have a reservoir bag and deliver high concentra-\ntions of O2 (60\u201390%), determined by the in\ufb02 ow (10\u201315L/min) and the presence of \n\ufb02 ap valves on the side. They are commonly used in emergencies, but are imprecise \nand should be avoided in those requiring controlled O2 therapy.\nPromoting oxygenation: Other ways to \ue000 oxygenation to reach the target SaO2 \n(this should be given as a number on the drug chart):\n  \n\u2022 Treat anaemia (transfuse if essential).\n  \n\u2022 Improve cardiac output (treat heart failure).\n  \n\u2022 Chest physio to improve ventilation/perfusion mismatch.\nAdministering oxygen\nNormal pH is 7.35\u20137.45. pH <7.35 indicates acidosis and >7.45 indicates alkalosis. \nIf the pCO2 is in keeping with the pH, the problem is likely to be a respiratory \nproblem (eg high pCO2 and pH <7.35 = likely a respiratory acidosis). If the HCO3\n\u03a9 \nis in keeping with the pH, this is suggestive of a metabolic problem (eg high \nHCO3\n\u03a9 and pH > 7.45 = metabolic alkalosis).\nTable 4.7 Interpreting blood gas analysis\npH\nPaCO2\nHCO3\n\u03a9\nMetabolic acidosis\nLow\nNormal/low\nLow\nRespiratory acidosis\nLow\nHigh\nNormal/high\nMetabolic alkalosis\nHigh\nNormal/high\nHigh\nRespiratory alkalosis\nHigh\nLow\nNormal/low\nSteps to ABG interpretation:\n1  pH: acidosis or alkalosis?\n2  pCO 2: high/low?
