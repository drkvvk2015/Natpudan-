Also, \nremember that a normal LFT does not exclude liver disease.\nTests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis\nAminotransferases: (AST, ALT) Released in the bloodstream after hepatocellular \ninjury. ALT is more speci\ufb01 c for hepatocellular injury (but also expressed in kidney \nand muscle). AST is also expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and RBCS. \nAlkaline phosphatase: May originate from liver, bone (so raised in growing chil-\ndren) or placenta.\nGamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; \ue083GT): Present in liver, pancreas, renal tubules, \nand intestine\u2014but not bone, so it helps tell if a raised ALP is from bone (GGT\ue009) or \nliver (GGT\ue000). NB: it is not speci\ufb01 c to alcohol damage to the liver.\nTests of hepatic function Serum albumin, serum bilirubin, PT (INR).\nHepatocellular predominant liver injury \ue000AST & \ue000ALT. Evaluate promptly, consid-\ner medications, collateral history from family (\u2018Could he be consuming \ue000alcohol?\u2019); \nultrasound for fatty liver, metastases , viral serology (hepatitis A, B, C, E, EBV, CMV).\nAlcoholic liver disease: AST/ALT ratio is typically 2:1 or more. When the history is \nnot reliable, normal ALP, \ue000GGT, and macrocytosis suggest this condition. \nAcute viral hepatitis: \ue000ALT; bilirubin may be \ue009. NB: AST may be \ue000\ue000, p278, p281.\nChronic viral hepatitis: \ue000ALT; HBV & C are a leading cause worldwide.\nAutoimmune hepatitis (AIH): Occurs mainly in young and middle-aged females.\nFatty in\ufb01 ltration of the liver: (See p285.) Probably the chief cause of mildly \nraised LFTS in the general population and may be recognized on ultrasound.\nIschaemic hepatitis: Can be seen in conditions when eff ective circulatory volume \nis low (eg MI, hypotension, haemorrhage). \ue000\ue000\ue000ALT, as well as LDH. \nDrug-induced hepatitis: As no speci\ufb01 c serology identi\ufb01 es most culprits, a good \nhistory is vital. Paracetamol overdose causes most acute liver failure in the UK.\nCholestasis predominant liver injury ALP and GGT are \ue000; AST and ALT mildly\ue000.\nManagement For each speci\ufb01 c diagnosis, manage accordingly. If asymptomatic \nand other tests are \u03a9ve, try lifestyle modi\ufb01 cation. Help reduce weight and alcohol \nuse (p280 & OHCS p512); control DM & dyslipidaemia; stop hepatotoxic drugs.\nFollow-up Repeat tests after 1\u20132 months; if still \ue000, do US (\u00b1 abdominal CT).  If di-\nagnosis still unclear, get help: is biopsy needed? Consider (if you haven\u2019t already) \n\ue0251-antitrypsin levels, serum caeruloplasmin (Wilson\u2019s disease), coeliac serology, \nANA and ASMA (AIH, p284). \nApproaches to abnormal liver function tests (LFTS)", "text_length": 2681, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 299/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 298, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.687831", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.688543", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
