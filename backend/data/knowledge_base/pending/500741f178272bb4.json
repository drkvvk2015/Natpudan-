Selective intra-\narterial calcium infusions (IACS) showed a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion after \ninfusion of the splenic and superior mesenteric arteries, so setting the stage for \n\u2018hunt the insulinoma\u2019.\nBut cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic ultrasound were normal. At lapa-\nrotomy, no lesion was found despite mobilization of the pancreas, or during intra-\noperative ultrasound. \u2018Time to sew up and go home?\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 said the surgeon, \u2018I\u2019m \ngoing to do a distal pancreatectomy\u2019. Histology showed no discrete insulinoma, \nbut diff use islet cell hyper plasia (nesidioblastosis). How much pancreas to resect? \nToo little and nothing is gained: too much spells pancreatic endocrine disaster. \nLuckily the surgeon guessed right, and the patient was cured by the procedure.16\nPursuing a voyage to the islets of Langerhans to the bitter end\nInsulinoma\nThis often benign (90\u201395%) pancreatic islet cell tumour is sporadic or seen with MEN-1 \n(p223).
