Sick minds must be healed as well as sick bodies.\u2019 C Jeff  Miller, 1931.\nMental state examination: ASEPTIC\n  \n\u2022 Appearance and behaviour: dress, hygiene, eye contact, rapport.\n  \n\u2022 Speech: volume, rate, tone.\n  \n\u2022 Emotion: mood (subjective and objective), aff ect (how mood is expressed with \nbehaviour\u2014appropriate or incongruent?).\n  \n\u2022 Perception: hallucinations\u2014auditory (in the second or third person)?, visual?\n  \n\u2022 Thought:\n  \n\u2022 Form: block, insertion, broadcast, \ufb02 ight of ideas, knight\u2019s move.\n  \n\u2022 Content: delusions, obsessions, phobias, preoccupations, self-harm, suicide.\n  \n\u2022 Insight: ask the patient why they have presented today.\n  \n\u2022 Cognition: orientation, registration, recall, concentration, knowledge.\nDo not be afraid to ask about suicidal thoughts and plans. Remove yourself from the \nsituation if you feel threatened.\nDepression\nTwo questions can be used to identify depression:19\n1   During the last month, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, \nor hopeless?\n2   During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest \nor pleasure in doing things?\nIf a person answers \u2018yes\u2019 to either question they should undergo mental health as-\nsessment including a risk assessment of self-harm and suicide. Appropriate treat-\nments include psychosocial intervention (guided self-help, cognitive behavioural \ntherapy, structured physical activity) and medication. Treatment choice depends on \ndisease severity, previous psychiatric history, response to treatment, and patient \npreference. If medication is indicated, a generic SSRI should be considered \ufb01 rst line \nafter consideration of GI bleeding risk, drug interactions, toxicity, overdose, and dis-\ncontinuation symptoms. The full eff ect of medication is gradual, over 4\u20136 weeks.\nCapacity\nThe Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 has a two-stage test for lack of capacity:\n1   There is an impairment or disturbed functioning of the mind.\n2   The patient is unable to make a decision.\nDecision-making is impaired if the patient is unable to: understand the relevant \ninformation, retain it for long enough to make a decision, weigh up the informa-\ntion, communicate their decision. Capacity is decision-speci\ufb01 c not patient-speci\ufb01 c. \nWhen treatment is proposed to those who lack capacity, a capacity advocate should \nbe provided. Even patients without capacity should be as involved as possible in \ndecision-making.\nMental Health Act (MHA) and common law\nA patient can be detained under common law (subject to a test of reasonableness) \nor under the MHA, only if they lack capacity to remain informally and are a danger \nto themselves or others. You will have more experience in verbal and non-verbal \ncommunication, than in detention under the MHA, so use these skills \ufb01 rst to try and \nde-escalate the situation. If rapid tranquillization is needed, be familiar with dosage, \nside-eff ects, and the need for ongoing observation. If there is no history to guide \nchoice of medication, intramuscular lorazepam can be used.20\nDoctors and mental health\nSuicide rates are three times higher in doctors compared to the general population. \nUp to 7% of doctors will have a substance abuse problem within their lifetime. Do \nnot ignore feeling low, poor concentration, and reduced energy levels. Do not self-\ndiagnose and manage. Avoid \u2018corridor consultations\u2019. Trust your GP.
