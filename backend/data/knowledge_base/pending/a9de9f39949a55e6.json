Destruction of the adrenal cortex leads to glucocorticoid (cortisol) \nand mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) de\ufb01 ciency (see \ufb01 g 5.21). Signs are capricious: \nit is \u2018the unforgiving master of non-speci\ufb01 city and disguise\u2019.23 You may diagnose \na viral infection or anorexia nervosa in error (K\n+ is \ue001 in the latter but \ue000 in Addison\u2019s).\nPhysiology:\nCauses: 80% are due to autoimmunity in the UK. Other causes: TB (commonest cause \nworldwide), adrenal metastases (eg from lung, breast, renal cancer), lymphoma, op-\nportunistic infections in HIV (eg CMV, Mycobacterium avium, p400); adrenal haem-\norrhage (\ue022Waterhouse\u2013Friderichsen syndrome p714; antiphospho lipid syndrome; \nSLE), congenital (late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia).\nSecondary adrenal insuffi  ciency The commonest cause is iatrogenic, due to long-\nterm steroid therapy leading to suppression of the pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. This only \nbecomes apparent on withdrawal of the steroids. Other causes are rare and include \nhypothalamic\u2013pituitary disease leading to \ue001ACTH production. Mineralocorticoid pro-\nduction remains intact, and there is no hyperpigmentation as \ue001ACTH.\nSymptoms Often diagnosed late: lean, tanned, tired, tearful \u00b1 weakness, anorexia, \ndizzy, faints, \ufb02 u-like myalgias/arthralgias. Mood: depression, psychosis. GI: nausea/\nvomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/constipation. Think of Addison\u2019s in all with un-\nexplained abdominal pain or vomiting. Pigmented palmar creases & buccal mucosa \n(\ue000ACTH; cross-reacts with melanin receptors). Postural hypotension. Vitiligo. \ue022Signs \nof critical deterioration (p836): Shock (\ue001BP, tachycardia), T\u00b0\ue000, coma.\nTests \ue001Na\n+ & \ue000K\n+ (due to \ue001mineralocorticoid), \ue001glucose (due to \ue001cortisol). Also: urae-\nmia, \ue000Ca\n2+, eosinophilia, anaemia. \ue031: Short ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen\u00ae test): \nDo plasma cortisol before and \u00bdh after tetracosactide (Synacthen\u00ae) 250mcg IM. \nAddis on\u2019s is excluded if 30min cortisol >550nmol/L. Steroid drugs may interfere \nwith assays: ask lab. NB: in pregnancy and contraceptive pill, cortisol levels may \nbe reass uring but falsely \ue000, due to \ue000cortisol-binding globulin. Also: \u2022ACTH: In Addi-\nson\u2019s, 9AM ACTH is \ue000 (>300ng/L: inappropriately high). It is low in secondary causes \n\u202221-Hydroxylase adrenal autoantibodies: +ve in autoimmune disease in >80% \n\u2022Plasma renin & aldosterone: to assess mineralocortocoid status. AXR/CXR: Any \npast TB, eg upper zone \ufb01 brosis or adrenal calci\ufb01 cation? If no autoantibodies, con-\nsider further tests (eg adrenal CT) for TB, histoplasma, or metastatic disease. \nTreatment \ue022See p836 for Addisonian crisis (shocked). Replace steroids: ~15\u201325mg \nhydrocortisone daily, in 2 \u20133 doses, eg 10mg on waking, 5mg lunchtime. Avoid giving \nlate (may cause insomnia). Mineralocorticoids to correct postural hypotension, \ue001Na\n+, \n\ue000K\n+: \ufb02 udrocortisone PO from 50\u2013200mcg daily. Adjust both on clinical grounds. If \nthere is a poor response, sus pect an associated auto immune disease (check thyroid, \ndo coeliac serology: p266). \nFig 5.21 Pathways involved in adrenal function.", "text_length": 3270, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 234/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 233, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.396495", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.397166", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
