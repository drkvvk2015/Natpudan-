Monitor PSA.\nMale hypogonadism\n\n--- Page 246 ---\n232\nEndocrinology\nHypopituitarism\nHypopituitarism entails \ue001secretion of anterior pituitary hormones (\ufb01 gs 5.3, 5.22). They \nare aff ected in this order: growth hormone (GH), gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating \nhormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and \nadreno corticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL). Panhypo pituitarism is de\ufb01 cien-\ncy of all anterior hormones, usually caused by irradiation, surgery, or pituitary tumour.\nCauses are at three levels. 1 Hypothalamus: Kallman\u2019s syndrome (p231), tumour, \nin\ufb02 am mation, infection (meningitis, TB), ischaemia. 2 Pituitary stalk: Trauma, sur-\ngery, mass lesion (craniopharyngioma, p234), meningioma, carotid artery aneurysm. \n3 Pituitary: Tumour, irradiation, in\ufb02 ammation, autoimmunity,\n7 in\ufb01 ltration (haemo-\nchromatosis, amy loid, metastases), ischaemia (pituitary apoplexy, p234; DIC \n8; Shee-\nhan\u2019s syndrome\n9).\nFeatures are due to:\n1 Hormone lack: \u2022GH: central obesity, atherosclerosis, dry wrinkly skin, \ue001strength, \n\ue001bala nce, \ue001well-being, \ue001exercise ability, \ue001cardiac output, osteoporosis, \ue001glucose. \n\u2022Gonadotropin (FSH; LH): \ue033 oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, \ue001fertility, \ue001libido, os-\nteoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia. \ue032 Erectile dysfunction, \ue001libido, \ue001muscle bulk, \nhypogonadism (\ue001hair, all over; small testes; \ue001ejaculate volume; \ue001spermatogenesis). \n\u2022Thyroid: as for hypothyroidism (p220). \u2022Corticotropin: as for adrenal insuffi  ciency \n(p226). NB: no \ue000skin pigmentation as \ue001ACTH. \u2022Prolactin: rare: absent lactation.\n2 Causes: Eg pituitary tumour (p234), causing mass eff ect, or hormone secretion \nwith \ue001secretion of other hormones\u2014eg prolactinoma, acromegaly, rarely Cushing\u2019s.\nTests (The triple stimulation test is now rarely done.)\n  \n\u2022 Basal tests: LH and FSH (\ue001 or \ue009), testosterone or oestradiol (\ue001); TSH (\ue001 or \ue009), T4 (\ue001); \nprolactin (may be \ue000, from loss of hypothalamic dopamine that normally inhibits its \nrelease), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; \ue001\u2014used as a measure of GH axis, p238), \ncortisol (\ue001). Also do U&E (\ue001Na\n+from dilution), \ue001Hb (normochromic, normocytic).\n  \n\u2022 Dynamic tests: 1 Short Synacthen\u00ae test: (p226) to assess the adrenal axis. \n2 Insulin tolerance test (ITT): done in specialist centres to assess the adrenal and GH \naxes. CI: epilepsy, heart disease, adrenal failure. Consult lab \ufb01 rst. It involves IV insu-\nlin to induce hypoglycaemia, causing stress to \ue000cortisol and GH secretion. It is done \nin the morning (water only taken from 22:00h the night before). Have 50% glucose \nand hydrocortisone to hand and IV access. Glucose must fall below 2.2mmol/L and \nthe patient should bec ome symptomatic when cortisol and GH are taken. Normal: \nGH >20mU/L, and peak cortisol >550nmol/L.\n3 Arginine + growth hormone-releasing hormone test.\n4 Glucagon stimulation test is alternative when ITT is contraindicated.\n  \n\u2022 Investigate cause: MRI scan to look for a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion.\nTreatment Refer to an endocrinologist for assessment of pituitary fuction and to \noversee hormone replacement and treatment of underlying cause.\n  \n\u2022 Hydrocortisone for 2\u00b0 adrenal failure (p226) \ue007before other hormones are given.\n  \n\u2022 Thyroxine if hypothyroid (p220, but TSH is useless for monitoring).\n  \n\u2022 Hypogonadism (for symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis). \ue032: options include \ntestosterone enan thate 250mg IM every 3 weeks, daily topical gels or buccal \nmuco adhesive tablets. Patches (eg Testogel\u00ae) are also used. \ue033: (premenopausal). \nOestrogen: transdermal oestradiol patches, or contra ceptive pill (exceeds replace-\nment needs) \u00b1 testosterone or dehydroepi androsterone (DHEA, in hypo androgenic \nwomen; a small amount may improve well-being and sexual function, and help \nbone mineral density and lean body mass).\n  \n\u2022 Gonadotropin therapy is needed to induce fertility in both men and women.\n  \n\u2022 Growth hormone (GH). Somatotrophin mimics human GH. It addresses problems \nof \ue000fat mass, \ue001bone mass, \ue001lean body mass (muscle bulk), \ue001exercise capacity, and \nproblems with heat intolerance.\n7 Autoimmune hypophysitis (=in\ufb02 amed pituitary) mimics pituitary adenoma. It may be triggered by preg-\nnancy or immunotherapy blocking CTLA-4. No pituitary auto-antigen is yet used diagnostically.\n8 Snake bite is a common cause in India (eg when associated with acute kidney injury).\n9 Sheehan\u2019s syndrome is pituitary necrosis after postpartum haemorrhage.", "text_length": 4457, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 240/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 239, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.410116", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.410877", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
