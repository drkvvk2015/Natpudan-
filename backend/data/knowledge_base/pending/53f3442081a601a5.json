Tachycar-\ndia means rate >100bpm. See p127.\nSinus bradycardia Sinus rhythm at a rate <60bpm. Causes: Physical \ufb01 tness, vas-\novagal attacks, sick sinus syndrome, drugs (\ue020-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone), hypo-\nthyroidism, hypothermia, \ue000intracranial pressure, cholestasis. See p122.\nAF (ECG p125) Common causes: IHD, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, obesity, heart fail-\nure, alcohol. See p130.\nHeart block (HB) (See \ufb01 g 3.5.) Disrupted passage of electrical impulse through the \nAV node.\n1st-degree HB: The PR interval is prolonged and unchanging; no missed beats.\n2nd-degree HB: Mobitz I: The PR interval becomes longer and longer until a QRS is \nmissed, the pattern then resets. This is Wenckebach phenomenon.\n2nd-degree HB: Mobitz II: QRSs are regularly missed. eg P - QRS - P - - P - QRS - P - - this \nwould be Mobitz II with 2:1 block (2P:1QRS). This is a dangerous rhythm as it may \nprogress to complete heart block.\n1st- and 2nd-degree HB may be caused by: normal variant, athletes, sick sinus syn-\ndrome, IHD (esp inferior MI), acute myocarditis, drugs (digoxin, \ue020-blockers).\n3rd-degree HB: Complete heart block: No impulses are passed from atria to ventri-\ncles so P waves and QRSS appear independently of each other. As tissue distal to the \nAVN paces slowly, the patient becomes very bradycardic, and may develop haemo-\ndynamic compromise. Urgent treatment is required. Causes: IHD (esp inferior MI), \nidiopathic (\ufb01 brosis), congenital, aortic valve calci\ufb01 c ation, cardiac surgery/trauma, \ndigoxin toxicity, in\ufb01 ltration (abscesses, granulomas, tumours, parasites).\nST elevation Normal variant (high take-off ), acute MI (STEMI), Prinzmetal\u2019s angina \n(p708), acute pericarditis (saddle-shaped), left ventricular aneurysm.\nST depression Normal variant (upward sloping), digoxin toxicity (downward sloping), \nischaemic (horizontal): angina, NSTEMI, acute posterior MI (ST depression in V1\u2013V3).\nT inversion In V1\u2013V3: normal (black patients and children), right bundle branch block \n(RBBB), RV strain (eg secondary to PE). In V2\u2013V5: anterior ischaemia, HCM, subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage, lithium. In V4\u2013V6 and aVL: lateral ischaemia, LVH, left bundle branch \nblock (LBBB). In II, III and aVF: inferior ischaemia.\nNB: ST- and T-wave changes are often non-speci\ufb01 c, and must be interpreted in the \nlight of the clinical context.\nMyocardial infarction (See p118 and \ufb01 g 3.21; example ECGs \ufb01 gs 3.9, 3.10)\n  \n\u2022 Within hours, the T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise.\n  \n\u2022 Within 24h, the T wave inverts. ST elevation rarely persists, unless a left ventricular \naneurysm develops. T-wave inversion may or may not persist.\n  \n\u2022 Within a few days, pathological Q waves begin to form. Q waves usually persist, but \nmay resolve in 10% of patients.\n  \n\u2022 The location of these changes indicates the ischaemic area location, see table 3.2.\nPulmonary embolism (\ufb01 g 3.11) ECG \ufb01 ndings may include: sinus tachycardia (com-\nmonest), RBBB (p100), right ventricular strain pattern (R-axis deviation, dominant R \nwave and T-wave inversion/ST depression in V1 and V2,). Rarely, the \u2018SIQIIITIII\u2019 pattern \noccurs: deep S waves in I, pathological Q waves in III, inverted T waves in III.\nMetabolic abnormalities Digoxin effect: Down-sloping ST depression and inverted \nT wave in V5\u2013V6 (\u2018reversed tick\u2019, see \ufb01 g 3.19). In digoxin toxicity, any arrhythmia may \noccur (ventricular ectopics and nodal bradycardia are common). Hyperkalaemia: \nTall, tented T wave, widened QRS, absent P waves, \u2018sine wave\u2019 appearance (see \ufb01 g 14.4, \np675). Hypokal aemia: Small T waves, prominent U waves, peaked P waves. Hypercal-\ncaemia: Short QT interval. Hypocalcaemia: Long QT interval, small T waves.
