The patient\u2019s memory, perception, \nor speech may be aff ected by the disorder, making the history diffi  cult to obtain. \nNote the progression of the symptoms and signs: gradual deterioration (eg tumour) \nvs intermittent exacerbations (eg multiple sclerosis) vs rapid onset (eg stroke). Ask \nabout age, occupation, and ethnic origin. Right- or left-hand dominant?\nPresenting symptoms\n  \n\u2022 Headache: (p456 & p780.) Diff erent to usual headaches? Acute/chronic? Speed \nof onset? Single/recurrent? Unilateral/bilateral? Associated symptoms (eg aura \nwith migraine, p458)? Any meningism (p822)? Worse on waking (\ue000ICP)? Decreased \nconscious level? \ue007Take a \u2018worst-ever\u2019 headache very seriously. (See p749.)\n  \n\u2022 Muscle weakness: (p466.) Speed of onset? Muscle groups aff ected? Sensory loss? \nAny sphincter disturbance? Loss of balance? Associated spinal/root pain?\n  \n\u2022 Visual disturbance: (OHCS p410.) eg blurring, double vision (diplopia), photophobia, \nvisual loss. Speed of onset? Any preceding symptoms? Pain in eye?\n  \n\u2022 Change in other senses: Hearing (p464), smell, taste? Abnormalities are not al-\nways due to neurological disease, consider ENT disease.\n  \n\u2022 Dizziness: (p462.) Illusion of surroundings moving (vertigo)? Hearing loss/tinnitus? \nAny loss of consciousness? Positional?\n  \n\u2022 Speech disturbance: (p86.) Diffi  culty in expression, articulation, or comprehension \n(can be diffi  cult to determine)? Sudden onset or gradual?\n  \n\u2022 Dysphagia: (p250.) Solids and/or liquids? Intermittent or constant? Diffi  culty in \ncoordination? Painful (odynophagia)?\n  \n\u2022 Fits/faints/\u2018funny turns\u2019/involuntary movements: (p468.) Frequency? Durat ion? \nMode of onset? Preceding aura? Loss of consciousness? Tongue biting? Inconti-\nnence? Any residual weakness/confusion? Family history?\n  \n\u2022 Abnormal sensations: Eg numbness, \u2018pins & needles\u2019 (paraesthesiae), pain, odd \nsensations. Distribution? Speed of onset? Associated weakness?\n  \n\u2022 Tremor: (p65.) Rapid or slow? Present at rest? Worse on deliberate movement? \nTaking \ue020-agonists? Any thyroid problems? Any family history? Fasciculations?\nCognitive state If there is any doubt about the patient\u2019s cognition, cognitive testing \nshould be undertaken. There are a number of tools including MMSE (subject to strict \ncopyright), GPCOG, TYM, and 6-CIT. The Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) is a \ncommonly used screening questionnaire for cognitive impairment:12\n1   Tell patient an address to recall at the end \n(eg 42 West Street)\nA score of \u22646 suggests poor cognit-\nion, acute (delirium), or chronic (de-\nmentia). AMTS correlates well with \nthe more detailed Mini-Mental State \nExamination (MMSE\u2122) NB: deaf, dys-\nphasic, depressed, and uncoop erative \npatients, as well as those who do not \nunderstand English, will also get low \nscores.13\n2   Age\n3   Time (to nearest hour)\n4   What year is it?\n5  Recognize 2 people (eg doctor & nurse)\n6   Date of birth\n7   Dates of the Second World War\n8   Name of current monarch/prime minister\n9   Where are you now? (Which hospital?)\n10   Count backwards from 20 to 1\nPast medical history Ask about meningitis/encephalitis, head/spine trauma, sei-\nzures, previous operations, risk factors for vascular disease (p470, AF, hypertension, \nhyperlipidaemia, diabetes, smoking), and recent travel, especially exotic destina-\ntions. Is there any chance that the patient is pregnant (eclampsia, OHCS p48)?\nDrug history Any anticonvulsant/antipsychotic/antidepressant medication? Any \npsychotropic drugs (eg ecstasy)? Any medication with neurological side-eff ects (eg \nisoniazid which can cause a peripheral neuropathy)?\nSocial and family history What can the patient do/not do, ie activities of daily \nliving (ADLs)? What\u2019s the Barthel Index score? Any family history of neurological \nor psychiatric disease? Any consanguinity?
