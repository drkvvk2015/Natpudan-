Initially 100mg/12h, increase by 200mg/d eve-\nry 2wks up to max 1000mg/12h. SE: leucopenia, diplopia, blurred vision, impaired \nbalance, drowsi ness, mild generalized erythematous rash, SIADH (rare; see p673).\nLamotrigine: As monotherapy, initially 25mg/d, \ue000 by 50mg/d every 2wks up to \n100mg/12h (max 250mg/12h). \ue007Halve monotherapy dose if on valproate; double if \non carbamazepine or pheny toin (max 350mg/12h). SE: maculopapular rash\u2014occurs \nin 10% (but 1/1000 develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necroly-\nsis) typically in 1st 8wks, especially if on valproate; warn patients to see a doctor at \nonce if rash or \ufb02 u symptoms develop; Other SES: diplopia, blurred vision, photosen-\nsitivity, tremor, agit ation, vomiting, aplastic anaemia.\nLevetiracetam: Initially 250mg/24h, increase by 250mg/12h every 2wks up to max \n1 . 5g/12h (if eGFR >80). SE: psychiatric side-eff ects are common, eg depression, agi-\ntation. Other SES: D&V, dyspepsia, drowsiness, diplopia, blood dyscrasias.\nSodium valproate: Initially 300mg/12h, increase by 100mg/12h every 3d up to max \n30mg/kg (or 2 . 5g) daily. SE: teratogenic. Nausea is very common (take with food). \nOther SES: liver failure (watch LFT especially during 1st 6 months), pancreatitis, hair \nloss (grows back curly), oedema, ataxia, tremor, thrombocytopenia, encephalopa-\nthy (hyperammonaemia).\nPhenytoin: No longer 1st line due to toxicity (nystagmus, diplopia, tremor, dys-\narthria, ataxia) and SE: \ue001intellect, depression, coarse facial features, acne, gum \nhyper trophy, polyneuropathy, blood dyscr asias. Blood levels required for dosage.\n\ue007Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are liver enzyme inducing.\nEpilepsy and pregnancy\nEpilepsy carries a 5% risk of fetal abnormalities, so good seizure control prior to \nconception and during pregnancy is vital. Yet some anti-epileptics are teratogenic: \nthe patient must be given accurate information and counselling about contracep-\ntion, conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in order to make informed deci-\nsions. In particular:\n  \n\u2022 Advise women of child-bearing age to take folic acid 5mg/d.\n  \n\u2022 Strictly avoid sodium valproate and polytherapy prior to conception and during \npregnancy (lamotrigine is preferred but transition needs to be planned).\n  \n\u2022 Advise that most AEDS except carbamazepine and valproate are present in \nbreast milk. Lamotrigine is not thought to be harmful to infants.\n  \n\u2022 Discuss contraceptive methods, bearing in mind that: enzyme-inducing AEDS \nmake progesterone-only contraception unreliable, and oestrogen-containing \ncontraceptives lower lamotrigine levels\u2014an increased dose may be needed to \nachieve seizure control.\nAnti-epileptic drugs (AEDS): typical adult doses and side-eff ects", "text_length": 2858, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 501/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 500, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.035391", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.036846", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
