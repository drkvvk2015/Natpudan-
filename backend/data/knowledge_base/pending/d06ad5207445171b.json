Only 1 in 400 episodes of fatigue leads \nto visiting the doctor. \ue007Don\u2019t miss depression (p15). Even if depressed, still rule out \ncommon treatable causes\u2014eg anaemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes. After history \nand examination: FBC, ESR, U&E, plasma glucose, TFT, \u00b1 CXR. Follow up to see what \ndevelops, and to address emotional problems. Take a sleep history.\nFatigue\nWhile some night sweating is common in anxiety, drenching sweats requiring \nchanges of night-clothes are a more ominous symptom associated with infection \n(eg TB, brucellosis), lymphoproliferative disease, or other malignancies. Patterns \nof fever may be relevant (see p442).\nRigors are uncontrolled paroxysms of shivering which occur as a patient\u2019s tem-\nperature rises rapidly.\nSweating excessively (hyperhidrosis) may be primary (eg hidradenitis sup-\npurativa may be very distressing to the patient)\u2014or secondary to fever, pain or \nanxiety (cold & sweaty) or a systemic condition: the menopause, hyperthyroidism \n(warm & sweaty), acromegaly, malignancy, phaeochromocytoma, amyloidosis, or \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome (+hyper thermia). Or it may re\ufb02 ect gabapentin \nor opiate withdrawal, or a cholin er gic or parasympathomimetic side-eff ect (ami-\ntriptyline, bethanechol, distigmine, spider bites)\u2014also hormonal drugs, eg levo-\nthyroxine, gonadorelin or somatostatin analog ues, vasopressin, and ephedrine. Also \namiodarone, cipro\ufb02 oxacin, levodopa, lisinopril, rivastigmine, ritonavir, pioglitazone, \nvenlafaxine. At the bedside: ask about all drugs, examine all over for nodes; any \nsigns of hyperthyroidism? Any spleno megaly? Test the urine; do T\u00b0, ESR, TSH, FBC, & \nblood culture. \ue057: Antiperspirants (aluminium chloride 20%=Driclor\u00ae), sympathec-\ntomy, or iontophoresis may be tried.\nFevers, rigors, sweats\nThis is trivial\u2014until we ourselves have a few sleepless nights. Then sleep becomes \nthe most desirable thing imaginable, and bestowing it the best thing we can do, \nlike relieving pain. But don\u2019t give drugs without looking for a cause.\n  \n\u2022 Self-limiting: Jet lag; stress; shift work; in hospital. We need less sleep as we age.\n  \n\u2022 Psychic: Depression; anxiety; mania; grief; psychomotor agitation/psychosis.\n  \n\u2022 Organic: Drugs (many; eg caff eine; me\ufb02 oquine; nicotine withdrawal); nocturia; \nalcohol; pain (eg acid re\ufb02 ux\u2014worse on lying down); itch; tinnitus; asthma; dys-\ntonias; obstructive sleep apnoea (p194); dementia; restless leg syndrome (p698, \ncheck ferritin). Rarer: encephalitis (eg West Nile virus) and encephalopathy \n(Whipple\u2019s; pellagra; HIV; prion diseases, eg CJD, p696, and fatal familial insomnia).\n\ue057:Sleep hygiene. No daytime naps; don\u2019t turn in till you feel sleepy; regular bed-\ntime routines. Keep a room for sleep; don\u2019t eat or work in it (not viable for much \nof the world). Less caff eine, nicotine, late exercise (but sexual activity may give \nexcellent torpor!), and alcohol (its abuse causes paradoxical pro-adrenergic trem-\nor and insomnia). Try monitoring quality with a sleep diary (unless already over-\nobsessive). Music and relaxation may make sleep more restorative and augment \npersonal resources.\nHypnotic drugs. Give for a few nights only (addictive and cause daytime somno-\nlence \u00b1 rebound insomnia on stopping). Warn about driving/machine use. Exam-\nple: zopiclone 3.75\u20137.5mg. Obstructive sleep apnoea, p194. Parasomnias, sleep \nparalysis, etc. OHCS p371.
