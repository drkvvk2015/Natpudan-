Make sure the patient details are at the top of every side of \npaper. Write legibly\u2014this may save more than the patient.\n  \n\u2022 A problem list will help you structure your thoughts and guide others.\n  \n\u2022 BODEX: Blood results, Observations, Drug chart, ECG, X-rays. Look at these. If you \nthink there is something of concern, make sure someone else looks at them too.\n  \n\u2022 Document what information has been given to the patient and relatives.\nHandover\n  \n\u2022 Make sure you know when and where to attend.\n  \n\u2022 Make sure you understand what you need to do and why. \u2018Check blood results\u2019 or \n\u2018Review warning score\u2019 is not enough. Better to: \u2018Check potassium in 4 hours and \ndiscuss with a senior if it remains >6.0mmol/L\u2019 .\nOn call\n  \n\u2022 Write it down.\n  \n\u2022 The ABCDE approach (p779) to a sick patient is never wrong.\n  \n\u2022 Try and establish the clinical context of tasks you are asked to do. Prioritize and let \nstaff  know when you are likely to get to them.\n  \n\u2022 Learn the national early warning score (NEWS) (p892, \ufb01 g A1).\n  \n\u2022 Smile, even when talking by phone. Be polite.\n  \n\u2022 Eat and drink, preferably with your team.\nMaking a referral\n  \n\u2022 Have the clinical notes, observation chart, drug chart, and investigation results to \nhand. Read them before you call.\n  \n\u2022 Use SBAR: Situtation (who you are, who the patient is, the reason for the call), \nBackground, Assessment of the patient now, Request.\n  \n\u2022 Anticipate: urine dip for the nephrologist, PR exam for the gastroenterologist.\nWith the going down of the sun we can momentarily cheer ourselves up by the \nthought that we are one day nearer to the end of life on earth\u2014and our respon-\nsibility for the unending tide of illness that \ufb02 oods into our corridors, and seeps \ninto our wards and consulting rooms. Of course you may have many other quiet \nsatisfactions, but if not, read on and wink with us as we hear some fool telling us \nthat our aim should be to produce the greatest health and happiness for the great-\nest number. When we hear this, we don\u2019t expect cheering from the tattered ranks \nof on-call doctors; rather, our ears detect a decimated groan, because these men \nand women know that there is something at stake in on-call doctoring far more \nelemental than health or happiness: namely survival.\nWithin the \ufb01 rst weeks, however brightly your armour shone, it will now be \nsmeared and spattered, if not with blood, then with the fallout from the many \ndecisions that were taken without suffi  cient care and attention. Force majeure on \nthe part of Nature and the exigencies of ward life have, we are suddenly stunned \nto realize, taught us to be second-rate; for to insist on being \ufb01 rst-rate in all areas \nis to sign a death warrant for ourselves and our patients. Don\u2019t keep re-polishing \nyour armour, for perfectionism does not survive untarnished in our clinical world. \nRather, to \ufb02 ourish, furnish your mind and nourish your body. Regular food makes \nmidnight groans less intrusive. Drink plenty: doctors are more likely to be oliguric \nthan their patients. And do not voluntarily deny yourself the restorative power of \nsleep, for it is our natural state, in which we were \ufb01 rst created, and we only wake \nto feed our dreams.\nWe cannot prepare you for \ufb01 nding out that you are not at ease with the person \nyou are becoming, and neither would we dream of imposing a speci\ufb01 c regimen of \nexercise, diet, and mental \ufb01 tness. Finding out what can lead you through adversity \nis the art of living.\nLiving with blood spattered armour", "text_length": 3839, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 22/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 21, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.893811", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.894523", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
