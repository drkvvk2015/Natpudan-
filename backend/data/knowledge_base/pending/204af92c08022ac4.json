The oxidative \npathways are catalysed by the family of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, the most \nimportant of which is the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme. The cytochrome P450 pathway may \nbe either induced or inhibited by a range of commonly used drugs and foods (table \n14.7).\nThis can lead to important interactions or side-eff ects. For example, phenytoin \nreduces the eff ectiveness of the contraceptive pill due to more rapid oestrogen \nmetabolism, and cipro\ufb02 oxacin retards the metabolism of methylxanthines (ami-\nnophylline) which leads to higher plasma levels and potentially more side-eff ects. \nThe BNF contains a list of the major interactions between drugs.\nTable 14.7 Common inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes\nEnzyme inducers\nEnzyme inhibitors\nPhenytoin\nSSRIS\nAmiodarone\nRifampicin\nCipro\ufb02 oxacin\nDiltiazem\nCarbamazepine\nIsoniazid\nVerapamil\nAlcohol\nMacrolides\nOmeprazole\nSt John\u2019s wort\nHIV protease inhibitors\nGrapefruit juice\nBarbiturates\nImidazole and triazole antifungal agents\nEnzyme inducers and inhibitors", "text_length": 1180, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 697/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 696, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.368041", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.370606", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
