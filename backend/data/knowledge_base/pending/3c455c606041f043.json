HIF1a is hydroxylated\nin normoxic conditions, which is then ubiquiti\nnated by VHL protein complex and destroyed.\nAccumulation of HIF1a happens with hypoxic\nconditions or mutated VHL protein, which then\nheterodimerizes with HIF1b and activates tran\nscription of various genes such as VEGF. Devel\nopment of targeted therapy for renal cell carci\nnoma was facilitated by our understanding of\nthe VHL HIF1a VEGF pathway\nBladder Cancer\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nCLASSIFICATION BY HISTOLOGY\n\u0002\nTRANSITIONAL CELL (90%)\n\u0002\nSQUAMOUS (8%)\n\u0002\nADENOCARCINOMA (2%)\n\u0002\nRHABDOMYOSARCOMA\n\u0002\nLYMPHOMA\n\u0002\nCARCINOID\nNATURAL HISTORY OF SUPERFICIAL TUMORS\nlow grade superficial tumors have high recurrence\nrate (80%) and low risk of becoming invasive (10%).\nHigh grade\nsuperficial\ntumors\nare\nfrequently\nassociated with carcinoma in situ, which is usually\nmultifocal and has a high chance of becoming inva\nsive (80% within 10 years)\nRISK FACTORS\n\u0002\nPERSONAL\nage\n\u0002\nENVIRONMENTAL\nsmoking (4\u0003), occupation (dye,\nrubber, textiles, leather, and petroleum industries\nwith exposure to aniline, arylamines such as ben\nzidine and 2 naphthylamine and amides), drugs\n(cyclophosphamide), pelvic radiation\n\u0002\nFAMILY HISTORY\naffected relatives\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY (CONT\u2019D)\n208\nBladder Cancer", "text_length": 3677, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 218/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 217, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.546308", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.547291", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
