Whatever \ufb02 uid you \nare sampling, a green needle carries far less risk \nthan a formal drain. It also allows you to decide \nwhether a drain is required.\nAscites may be sampled to give a cytological \nor bacterial diagnosis, eg to exclude spontaneous \nbacterial peritonitis (SBP; p276). Before starting, \nknow the patient\u2019s platelets + clotting times. If \nthey are abnormal, seek help before proceeding.\n  \u2022 Place the patient \ufb02 at and tap out the ascites, \nmarking a point where \ufb02 uid has been identi\ufb01 ed, \navoiding vessels, stomas, and scars (adhesions to \nthe anterior abdominal wall). The left side may \nbe safer\u2014less chance of nicking liver (\ufb01 g 18.5).\n  \n\u2022 Clean the skin. In\ufb01 ltrate some local anaes-\nthetic, eg 1% lidocaine (see p573).\n  \n\u2022 Insert a 21G needle on a 20mL syringe into the \nskin and advance while aspirating until \ufb02 uid is \nwithdrawn, try to obtain 60mL of \ufb02 uid.\n  \n\u2022 Remove the needle, apply a sterile dressing.\n  \n\u2022 Send \ufb02 uid to microbiology (15mL) for microscopy and culture, biochemistry \n(5mL for protein, see p192), and cytology (40mL). Call microbiology to forewarn \nthem if urgent analysis of the specimen is required.\nDiagnostic aspiration of a pleural eff usion\n  \n\u2022 If not yet done, a CXR may help evaluate the side and size of the eff usion.\n  \n\u2022 Ideally use US guidance at the bedside (\ue000 chance of successful aspirate and \ue001 \nchance of organ puncture). If this is unavailable, ask an ultrasonographer to \nmark a spot, or percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose a site \n1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (usually posteriorly or laterally).\n  \n\u2022 Clean the area around the marked spot with 2% chlorhexidine solution.\n  \n\u2022 In\ufb01 ltrate down to the pleura with 5\u201310mL of 1% lidocaine.\n  \n\u2022 Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of the \nrib below the mark to avoid the neurovascular bundle (\ufb01 g 18.6). Aspirate whilst \nadvancing the needle. Draw off  10\u201330mL of pleural \ufb02 uid. Send \ufb02 uid to the lab \nfor chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH); bacteriology (microscopy and culture, \nauramine stain, TB culture); cytology, and, if indicated, amylase and immunology \n(rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, complement).\n\ue022If you cannot obtain \ufb02 uid with a 21G needle, seek help.\n  \n\u2022 If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.\nDiagnostic taps\nFig 18.5 Always tap out the ascites, \nbut aim approximately for 5cm me-\ndial to and superior to the anterior \nsuperior iliac spine. If in doubt, ask \nfor an ultrasound to mark the spot.\nFig 18.6 Safe approach to entering the pleura by the intercostal route.", "text_length": 2762, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 773/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 772, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.510037", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.511059", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
