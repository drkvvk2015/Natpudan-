The glands are \ncontrolled by \u03a9ve feedback via Ca\n2+ levels. PTH acts by: \u2022\ue000osteoclast activity releasing \nCa\n2+ and PO4\n3\u03a9 from bones \u2022\ue000Ca\n2+ and \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9 reabsorption in the kidney \u2022active \n1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 production is \ue000. Overall eff ect is \ue000Ca\n2+ and \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism Causes: ~80% solitary adenoma, ~20% hyper plasia of \nall glands, <0.5% parathyroid cancer. Presentation: Often \u2018asymp tomatic\u2019 (\ue007not in retro-\nspect!), with \ue000Ca\n2+ on routine tests. Signs relate to: 1 \ue000Ca\n2+ (p676): weak, tired, depressed, \nthirsty, dehydrated-but-polyuric; also renal stones, abdominal pain, \npanc reatitis, and ulcers (duodenal : gast ric \u2248 7:1). 2 Bone resorption \neff ects of PTH can cause pain, fractures, and osteopenia/osteopo-\nrosis. 3 \ue000BP: \ue007so check Ca\n2+ in everyone with hypertension. Associa-\ntion: MEN-1 (BOX \u2018Multiple endocrine neoplasia\u2019). Tests: \ue000Ca\n2+ & \ue000PTH or \ninappropriately normal (other causes of this: thiazides, lithium, fa-\nmilial hypo calciuric hypercalcaemia, ter tiary hyper parathyroidism). \nAlso \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9 (unless in renal failure), \ue000ALP from bone activity, 24h uri-\nnary \ue000Ca\n2+. Imaging: osteitis \ufb01 brosa cystica (due to severe resorp-\ntion; rare) may show up as subperiosteal erosions, cysts, or brown \ntumours of phal anges \u00b1 acro-osteolysis (\ufb01 g 5.17) \u00b1 \u2018pepper-pot\u2019 \nskull. DEXA (p683; for osteopor osis, p682). \ue057: If mild: advise \ue000\ufb02 uid in-\ntake to prevent stones; avoid thiazides + high Ca\n2+ & vit D intake; \nsee 6-monthly. Excision of the adenoma or of all four hyperplastic \nglands prevents fractures and peptic ulcers. Indications: high se-\nrum or urinary Ca\n2+, bone disease, osteo por osis, renal calculi, \ue001renal \nfunction, age \ue00550yrs. Complications: Hypo para thy roidism, recur-\nrent laryngeal nerve damage (\ue018 hoarse), sympto matic Ca\n2+\ue001 (hungry \nbones syndr ome; check Ca\n2+ daily for \u226514d post-op). Pre-op US and \nMIBI scan may localize an adenoma; intra-operative PTH sampling is \nused to con\ufb01 rm removal. Recurrence: ~8% over 10yrs.19 Cinacalcet \n(a \u2018calcimimetic\u2019) \ue000sensitivity of parathyroid cells to Ca\n2+ (\ue018 \ue001PTH secret ion); monitor Ca\n2+ \nwithin 1 week of dose changes; SE: myalgia; \ue001testosterone.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism \ue001Ca\n2+, \ue000PTH (appropriately). Causes: \ue001vit D intake, \nchronic renal failure. \ue057 : Correct causes. Phosphate binders; vit D; cinacalcet if PTH \n\u226585pmol/L and parathyroidectomy tricky.\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism \ue000Ca\n2+, \ue000\ue000PTH (inappropriately). Occurs after pro-\nlonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, causing glands to act autonomously having \nundergone hyperplastic or adenomatous change. This causes \ue000Ca\n2+ from \ue000\ue000secretion \nof PTH unlimited by feedback control. Seen in chronic renal failure.\nMalignant hyperparathyroidism Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) is produced \nby some squamous cell lung cancers, breast and renal cell carcinomas. This mimics \nPTH resulting in \ue000Ca\n2+ (PTH is \ue001, as PTHrP is not detected in the assay).\nHypoparathyroidism\nPrimary hypoparathyroidism PTH secretion is \ue001 due to gland failure. Tests: \ue001Ca\n2+, \n\ue000PO4\n3\u03a9or \ue009, \ue009ALP. Signs: Those of hypocalcaemia, p678 \u00b1 autoimmune co morbid ities \n(BOX \u2018Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes\u2019). Causes: Autoimmune; congenital (Di \nGeorge syn., OHCS p642). \ue057 : Ca\n2+ supplements + calcitriol (or synthetic PTH /12h SC: it \nprevents hypercalciuria). \nSecondary hypoparathyroidism Radiation, surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroid-\nectomy), hypomagnesaemia (magnesium is required for PTH secretion).\nPseudohypoparathyroidism Failure of target cell response to PTH. Signs: Short \nmetacarpals (esp. 4th and 5th, \ufb01 g 5.18), round face, short stature, calci\ufb01 ed basal \nganglia (\ufb01 g 5.19), \ue001IQ. Tests: \ue001Ca\n2+, \ue000PTH, \ue009 or \ue000ALP. \ue057: As for 1\u00b0 hypoparathyroidism.\nPseudopseudohypoparathyroidism The morphological features of pseudo hypo-\nparathyroidism, but with normal biochemistry. The cause for both is genetic. \nFig 5. 17 Acro-\nosteo lysis.\n\u00a9Dr I Maddison \nmyweb.lsbu.ac.uk.", "text_length": 4222, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 230/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 229, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.385530", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.386642", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
