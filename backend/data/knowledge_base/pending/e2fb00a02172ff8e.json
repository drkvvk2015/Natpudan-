For simplicity, a single-item question has \nmuch to recommend it, such as \u2018How many times in the past year have you had \ufb01 ve \n(four for \ue033) or more drinks in a day?\u2019 (+ve if >0; 82% sensitive, 79% speci\ufb01 c). This can \nbe followed up with the easily remembered CAGE questions: Ever felt you ought to \ncut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? \nEver felt guilty about your drinking? Ever had an eye-opener in the morning? Those \nanswering \u2018yes\u2019 to \u22652 may be exhibiting dependency (sensitivity 43\u201394%; speci\ufb01 city \n70\u201397%), but accuracy does change according to background population. Those who \nrefuse, or give unconvincing answers may have more to tell in their biochemistry: \nlook for \ue000\ue034GT, \ue000ALT, \ue000MCV, AST:ALT>2, \ue001urea, \ue001platelets.\nScreening for unhealthy alcohol use\nThe patient: Malaise; \ue000TPR; anor exia; D&V; tender hepatomegaly \u00b1 jaundice; bleed-\ning; ascites.
