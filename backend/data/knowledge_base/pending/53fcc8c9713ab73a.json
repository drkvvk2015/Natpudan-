Positive\nblood cultures and corresponding radiologic findings\nmay support diagnosis and sometimes replace bone\nbiopsy. Consider holding off antibiotic therapy if not\nlife threatening infection to facilitate identification of\norganisms.

Consider vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h if\nhigh local MRSA rates. Once organism identified,\ntreat with specific antibiotic (total 6 12 weeks of\nantibiotics guided by susceptibility from time of\nbiopsy or definitive surgery, with at least 2 weeks of\nIV therapy).
