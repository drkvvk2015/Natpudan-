Get expert help if unsure or if patient remains shocked.\n3   Further boluses of 250\u2013500mL crystalloid with clinical review after each.\n4   Stop when euvolaemic or seek expert help when 2L given.\nWhich crystalloid? Any crystalloid can be used (follow local guidelines). 0.9% \n(\u2018normal\u2019) saline is non-buff ered, contains \ue000chloride, and may cause hyperchlo-\nraemic acidosis. \u2018Balanced\u2019 or buff ered crystalloids include Hartmann\u2019s, Ringer\u2019s \nlactate, and Plasma-Lyte\u00ae. Because they are \u2018balanced\u2019 they are often used prefer-\nentially. However, they contain 4\u20135mmol/L of K\n+ so caution if \ue000K\n+and oligo/anuria.\nWhat about colloid? Blood components should be used in resuscitation due to \nhaemorrhage. Human albumin solutions may be given only under specialist advice \nin hepatorenal syndrome and as second line to crystalloids in septic shock.\nHypervolaemia, \ufb02 uid overload:\nOccurs due to aggressive \ufb02 uid resuscitation, oliguria, and in sepsis due to \ue000capillary \npermeability. Monitor weight daily in patients receiving IV \ufb02 uids. Treat with:\n  \n\u2022 Oxygen supplementation if required.\n  \n\u2022 Fluid restriction. Consider oral and IV volumes. Give antibiotics in minimal \ufb02 uid \nand consider concentrated nutritional support preparations.\n  \n\u2022 Diuretics. Only in symptomatic \ufb02 uid overload. They are ineff ective and poten-\ntially harmful if used to treat oliguria without \ufb02 uid overload.\n  \n\u2022 Renal replacement therapy (p306). AKI with \ufb02 uid overload and oligo/anuria needs \nurgent referral to renal/critical care.\nFluid balance\n  \n\u2022 Mild = pH 7.30\u20137.36 (~bicarbonate >20mmol/L).\n  \n\u2022 Moderate = pH 7.20\u20137.29 (~bicarbonate 10\u201319mmol/L).\n  \n\u2022 Severe = pH <7.2 (~bicarbonate <10mmol/L): refer to renal/critical care.\nTreatment is of the underlying disorder which will stop acid production. Where \nthe eff ect of treatment may be delayed, acidosis will persist and renal replace-\nment may be indicated (p306).\nMedical management of acidosis is controversial. Giving sodium bicarbonate will \ngenerate CO2. Adequate ventilation is therefore needed to prevent respiratory acido-\nsis worsening the clinical picture. Sodium bicarbonate also represents a sodium and \na volume load which can precipitate \ufb02 uid overload in the vulnerable patient.\nAcidosis", "text_length": 3802, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 308/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 307, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.699354", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.699940", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
