There is also dorsal column degeneration, with loss of positional and vibration \nsense. Pes cavus and scoliosis occur. Cardiomyopathy may cause CCF. Typical age at \ndeath: ~50yrs. \ue057: There is no cure.

Georges Froin, 1874\u20131932 (French physician)\nGardner\u2019s syndrome A dominant variant of familial adenomatous polyposis, \ncaused by mutations in the APC gene (5q21). There are multiple colon polyps (which \ninevitably become malignant; p520),37 benign bone osteomas, epidermal cysts, \ndermoid tumours, \ufb01 bromas, and neuro\ufb01 bromas. Fundoscopy reveals black spots \n(congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium); this helps pre-symptomatic \ndetection. Presentation: Can present from 2\u201370yrs with colonic (eg bloody diar-\nrhoea) or extracolonic symptoms. Prophylactic surgery (eg proctocolectomy) is the \nonly curative treatment. Endoscopic polypectomy with long-term celecoxib therapy \nhas been used to postpone prophylactic colectomy.38 \nEldon J Gardner, 1909\u20131989 (US physician)\nG\u00e9lineau\u2019s syndrome (Narcolepsy.) The patient, usually a young man, succumbs \nto irresistible attacks of inappropriate sleep \u00b1 vivid hypnogogic hallucinations, \ncataplexy (sudden hypotonia), and sleep paralysis (paralysis of speech and move-\nment, while fully alert, at sleep onset or on waking). Hypothesis: Mutations lead to \nloss of hypothalamic hypocretin-containing neurons, via autoimmune des truction.39 \n95% are +ve for HLA DR2. \ue057: Stimulants (eg methylphenidate) may cause depend-\nence \u00b1 psychosis.

Prevalence: \n1\u20132%; 5\u201315% have a family history of jaundice. It may go unnoticed for many years \nand usually presents in adolescence with intermittent jaundice occuring during illness, \nexercise or fasting. Diagnosis: Mild \ue000bilirubin; normal FBC and reticulocytes (ie no hae-\nmolysis). It is a benign condition. \nNicolas Augustin Gilbert, 1858\u20131927 (French physician)\nGilles de la Tourette syndrome Tonic, clonic, dystonic, or phonic tics: jerks, blinks, \nsniff s, nods, spitting, stuttering, irrep ressible explosive obscene verbal ejaculations \n(coprolalia, in 20%) or gestures (coprophilia, 6%),40 grunts, squeaks, burps, twirlings, \nand nipping others \u00b1 tantrums. There may be a witty, innovatory, phantasmago-\nric picture, with mimicry (echopraxia), antics, impishness, extravagance, audacity, \ndram atizations, surreal associations, uninhibited aff ect, speed, \u2018go\u2019, vivid imagery \nand memory, and hunger for stimuli. The tic paradox: Tics are voluntary, but often \nunwanted: the desire to tic stems from the relief of the odd sensation that builds up \nprior to the tic and is relieved by it, \u2018like scratching a mosquito bite, tics lead to more \ntics\u2019.41 Mean age of onset: 6yrs. \ue032:\ue033\u22484:1. Pathogenesis: Unknown; multiple genetic \nloci implicated and neuroanatomical abnormalities reported on MRI. Ass ociations: \nObsessive\u2013compulsive disorder; attention de\ufb01 cit hyperactivity disorder. \ue057: (None \nmay be wanted.) Ris peridone, haloperidol, or pimozide.
