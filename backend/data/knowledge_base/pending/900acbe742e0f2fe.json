P2 is best heard at LUSB while opening snap is best\nheard at the apex\n2. P2 separates from A2 on inspiration, while open\ning snap tends to move closer to S2 on inspiration\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES BETWEEN S4 AND S1\n1. S4 is usually best heart at apex with the bell while\nS1 is best heard at base\n2. S4 is usually more widely separated from S1 than\nsplitting of S1\n3. S4 is loudest at the start of expiration, softest at\nmid inspiration\n4. S4 may be accentuated by lying down, exercise, or\nforced inspiration with closed glottis\n5. S4 has a lower pitch than S1\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES BETWEEN S3 AND\nOPENING SNAP\n1. S3 has a lower pitch than opening snap\n2. S3 occurs later than opening snap\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES BETWEEN S3 AND S4\n1. S3 has a lower pitch than S4\n2. S3 is closer to S2 while S4 is closer to S1\n3.

Two exceptions are the systolic\nmurmur\nof\nhypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy,\nwhich usually becomes much louder, and the sys\ntolic murmur of mitral valve prolapse, which\nbecomes longer and often louder (click moves\ncloser to S1)\n\u0002\nPOSITIONAL\nCHANGES\nmost murmurs diminish\nwith standing due to reduced preload. However,\nthe murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nbecomes louder and the murmur of mitral valve\nprolapse lengthens and often is intensified.
