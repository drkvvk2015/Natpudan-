Mass production and the \u2018golden age\u2019 of antibiotics fol-\nlowed, with the introduction of a variety of drugs selectively toxic to bacterial, but \nnot mammalian cells. This is achieved by:\n  \n\u2022 utilizing a target unique to bacteria, eg cell wall\n  \n\u2022 selectively targeting bacterial-speci\ufb01 c components, eg enzymes, ribosomes\n  \n\u2022 preventing transport of the drug into human cells, eg metronidazole can only be \ntransported into anaerobic bacteria.\nThe mechanism of action of diff erent classes of antibiotic is shown in \ufb01 g 9.4.\nThis spectrum of available antibiotics revolutionized clinical practice and led to \nthe declaration: \u2018It is time to close the book on infectious diseases, and declare \nthe war against pestilence won\u2019 (attributed in urban legend to Dr. William H \nStewart, US Surgeon General, 1965\u20131969). Such con\ufb01 dence failed to consider that \nthe capacity for a prokaryotic micro-organism to develop resistance far outstrips \nthe human capacity to develop new antibiotic drugs.\nAntibiotic resistance can be:\n  \n\u2022 Intrinsic: due to inherent structural or functional characteristics, eg vancomycin \ncannot cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms.\n  \n\u2022 Acquired: bacteria have been evolving to resist antibacterial agents for billions \nof years through mutation and/or the transfer of resistance properties. This evo-\nlutionary phenomenon is accelerated by selection pressure from antibiotic use \n(including agriculture, aquaculture, and horticulture) which provides a competi-\ntive advantage for mutated, resistant strains.\nResistance has emerged for all known antibiotics causing morbidity, mortality, \nand a huge cost burden worldwide.1 Misadventure is evident. Quinolones are syn-\nthetic, resistance cannot be acquired in nature, and yet it is epidemic.\nWhich brings us back to Alexander Fleming who, within 2 years of the mass-\nproduction of his \u2018miracle-mould\u2019, gave this sage warning in his Nobel lecture of \n1945: \u2018Mr X has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not \nenough to kill the streptococci, but enough to educate them to resist penicillin. \nHe then infects his wife. Mrs X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As \nthe streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails. Mrs X dies. \nWho is primarily responsible for Mrs X\u2019s death? Why Mr X, whose negligent use \nof penicillin changed the nature of the microbe.\u2019\nAntibiotics: action and resistance\nFig 9.4 Classes of antibiotics and their bacterial cell targets.\nGlycopeptides\nVancomycin\nTeicoplanin\nPolymyxins\nColistin\n30S subunit\nAminoglycosides\nTetracyclines\n50S subunit\nMacrolides\nClindamycin\nLinezolid\nChloramphenicol\nFusidic acid\nRNA polymerase\nRifamycins\nFolate synthesis\nSulfamethoxazole\nTrimethoprim\nDNA synthesis\nFluoroquinolones\nMetronidazole\nCell wall synthesis\nNucleic acid\nsynthesis\nProtein synthesis\nPABA\nDHF A\nTHF A\n50S\n30S\n\u03b2\u2013lactams \nPenicillins\nCephalosporins\nCarbapenems", "text_length": 3284, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 391/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 390, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.843716", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.844645", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
