It may \naff ect just the rectum (proctitis, as in ~30%) or extend to involve part of the colon (left-\nsided colitis, in ~40%) or the entire colon (pancolitis, in ~30%). It \u2018never\u2019 spreads proxi-\nmal to the ileocaecal valve (except for backwash ileitis). Cause Inappropriate immune \nresponse against (?abnormal) colonic \ufb02 ora in genetically susceptibile individuals. Pa-\nthology Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic colonic mucosa \u00b1 pseudo polyps formed by in-\n\ufb02 ammation. Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria\u2014in\ufb02 ammation \nis norm ally not transmural. Continuous in\ufb02 ammation limited to the mucosa diff erenti-\nates it from Crohn\u2019s disease. Prevalence 100\u2013200/100 000. Incid ence 10\u201320/100 000/\nyr; typically presents ~20\u201340yrs. UC is 3-fold as common in non-smokers (the opposite \nis true for Crohn\u2019s disease)\u2014symptoms may relapse on stopping smoking.\nSymptoms Episodic or chronic diarrhoea (\u00b1  blood & mucus); crampy abdom inal \ndis comfort; bowel frequency relates to severity (see table 6.8); urgency/tenes-\nmus \u2248 proctitis. Systemic symptoms in attacks: fever, malaise, anorexia, \ue001weight.\nSigns May be none. In acute, severe UC there may be fever, tachycardia, and a ten-\nder, distended abdomen. Extraintestinal signs: Clubbing; aphthous oral ulcers; ery-\nthema nodosum (p265); pyoderma gangrenosum; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; iritis; \nlarge joint arthritis; sacroiliitis; ankylosing spondylitis; PSC (p282); nutritional de\ufb01 cits.\nTests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, blood culture. Stool MC&S/CDT: (See p258.) To \nexclude Campylobacter, C. dif\ufb01 cile, Sal monella, Shigella, E. coli, amoebae. Faecal \ncalprotectin: A simple, non-invasive test for GI in\ufb02 ammation with high sensitivity. \nAXR: No faecal shadows; mucosal thickening/islands (\ufb01 g 16.9, p729); colonic dilata-\ntion (see \u2018Complications\u2019). Lower GI endoscopy: Limited \ufb02 exible sigmoidoscopy if \nacute to assess and biopsy; full colonoscopy once controlled to de\ufb01 ne disease extent \n(see p249, \ufb01 g 6.10).\nTable 6.8 Assessing severity in UC (Truelove & Witts criteria modi\ufb01 ed to include CRP)\nVariable\nMild UC\nModerate UC\nSevere UC\nMotions/day\n\u22644\n5\n\u22656\nRectal bleeding\nSmall\nModerate\nLarge\nT\u00b0C\nApyrexial\n37.1\u201337.8\u00b0C\n>37.8\u00b0C\nResting pulse\n<70 beats/min\n70\u201390 beats/min\n>90 beats/min\nHaemoglobin\n>110g/L\n105\u2013110g/L\n<105g/L\nESR (do CRP too)\n<30 \n>30 (or CRP >45mg/L)\nData from Truelove et al., \u2018Cortisone in ulcerative colitis\u2019, BMJ; 2(4947): 1041\u20138.\nComplications Acute: Toxic dilatation of colon (mucosal islands, colonic diameter \n>6cm) with risk of perforation; venous thromboembolism: give prophylaxis to all in-\npatients regardless of rectal bleeding (p350); \ue001K\n+ Chronic: Colonic cancer: risk related \nto disease extent and activity \u22485\u201310% with pancolitis for 20yrs. Neoplasms may oc-\ncur in \ufb02 at, normal-looking mucosa. To spot precursor areas of dysplasia, surveillance \ncolonoscopy eg 1\u20135yrs (depending on risk), with multiple random biopsies or biopsies \nguided by diff erential uptake by abnormal mucosa of dye sprayed endoscopically.\nTreatment Goals are to induce, then maintain disease remission.7\nMild UC: \u2022 5-ASA,\n17 eg mesalazine (=mesalamine) is the mainstay for remission-induc-\ntion/maintenance. Given PR (suppositories or enemas) for distal disease (eg Pen-\ntasa\u00ae 1g daily); or PO for more extensive disease (eg Pentasa\u00ae 2g daily; once-daily \ndosing as eff ective as split dose; combine PR+PO if \ufb02 are). \u2022 Topical steroid foams PR (eg \nhydrocortisone as Colifoam\u00ae), or prednisolone 20mg retention enemas (Predsol\u00ae) \nless eff ective than PR 5-ASA but may be added in addition.\nModerate UC: If 4\u20136 motions/day, but otherwise well, induce remission with oral \nprednisolone 40mg/d for 1wk, then taper by 5mg/week over following 7wks. Then \nmaintain on 5-ASA (SES: rash, haemolysis, hep atitis, pancreatitis, paradoxical wors-\nening of colitis \ue007monitor FBC and U&E at start, then at 3 months, then annually).\n17 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA or mesalazine) must be stabilized in oral preparations to survive gastric \npH. Alternatively, olsalazine is a dimer of 5-ASA or balsalazide is a prodrug, both of which are cleaved in the \ncolon.
