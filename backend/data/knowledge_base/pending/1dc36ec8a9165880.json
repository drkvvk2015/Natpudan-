Ideally\ncollect samples during acute attack. Other tests\ninclude erythrocyte porphyrins, plasma fluorescence\nspectrum, enzyme activity, DNA analysis, and skin\nbiopsy\nTREATMENTS\nfor acute porphyria, avoid precipi\ntating medications, alcohol and infections if possible,\nwith mostly supportive treatments during an epi\nsode. High dose carbohydrate (400 g/day) diet is\nrecommended acutely and exogenous heme infu\nsions (hematin 4 mg/kg IV q12h) should be consid\nered. For cutaneous porphyria, avoidance of sun is\nthe only preventative strategy\nLancet 2005 365:241\nMultisystem Disorders\n421", "text_length": 4840, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 427/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 426, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.835981", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.836700", "status": "pending"}
