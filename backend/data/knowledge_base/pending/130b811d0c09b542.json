It is the reciprocal of the absolute risk diff erence: 1 \u00f7 ARR.\nA large treatment eff ect means that fewer patients need to receive treatment in \norder for one to bene\ufb01 t. It is speci\ufb01 c to the chosen comparator (eg placebo or usual \ncare), the measured outcome (eg death, blood pressure fall), and the duration of \ntreatment follow-up used in the study. Look carefully at the details of the question \nthat the NNT is attempting to quantify.\n  \n\u2022 Advantages: easily calculated, single numerical value for effi  cacy, can be used to \nexamine harm (becomes the number needed to harm).\n  \n\u2022 Disadvantages: con\ufb01 dence intervals are diffi  cult when the diff erences between \ntreatments are not signi\ufb01 cant. \nYes or No? Your tutor asks whether Gobble\u2019s disease is commoner in women or \nmen. You have no idea, and make a guess. What is the chance of getting it right? \nCommon sense decrees that you have a 50:50 chance. Sod\u2019s law predicts that \nwhatever you guess, you will always be wrong. Somewhere between the two is \nDamon Runyon\u2019s view that \u2018all life is 6 to 5 against\u2019: Will you pick the right answer? \nPerhaps, but don\u2019t bet on it!\nNew or existing disease? Suppose singultus is a rare symptom of Gobble\u2019s dis-\nease (seen in 5% of patients), but that it is a very common symptom of Kobble\u2019s \ndisease (seen in 90%). If we have a man whom we already know has Gobble\u2019s \ndisease, who goes on to develop singultus, is it more likely to be due to Kobble\u2019s, \nrather than Gobble\u2019s disease? The answer is usually no: it is generally the case that \nmost symptoms are due to a disease that is already known, and do not imply a \nnew disease (Occam\u2019s razor, p4). The \u2018odds ratio\u2019 makes this clearer, ie the ratio \nof [the probability of the symptom, given the known disease] to [the probability \nof the symptom due to new disease \u2248 the probability of developing the new dis-\nease]. Usually this is vastly in favour of the symptom being due to the old disease, \nbecause of the prior odds of the two diseases. This will work until Kobble\u2019s dis-\nease increases in prevalence so as to increase the odds of a second disease (then \nHickam trumps Occam, p4).\nHow to play the odds It is distasteful to think that doctors can gamble with \npatients\u2019 lives. It is also distasteful to think of serious diseases being \u2018missed\u2019, and \ninvasive procedures being done unnecessarily. Yet we do not have an evidence \nbase or an experience base which can tell us de\ufb01 nitively which cough or lethargy \nor sore toe is just \u2018one of those things\u2019, and which is the result of undiagnosed \ncancer or HIV or osteomyelitis. And so we gamble.\nMedicine is not for pessimists\u2014almost anything can be made to seem fatal, so \nthat a pessimistic doctor would never get any sleep at night due to worry about \nthe meaning of their patients\u2019 symptoms. Medicine is not for blind optimists either, \nwho too easily embrace a fool\u2019s paradise of false reassurance. Rather, medicine is \nfor informed gamblers: gamblers who are happy to use subtle clues to change their \noutlook from pessimism to optimism and vice versa. Sometimes the gambling is \nscienti\ufb01 c, rational, methodical, and reproducible (odds ratio); sometimes it instinc-\ntual, due to clinical intuition (vital but ill-de\ufb01 ned).\nOf course, gambling inevitably results in losses, and in medicine the chips are \nnot just \ufb01 nancial. They betoken the health of your patient, your reputation, and \nyour con\ufb01 dence. Perhaps the hardest part of medicine is the inevitability of making \nmistakes whilst attempting to help (see \u2018Being wrong\u2019, p5). But do not worry about \ngambling: gambling is your job. If you cannot gamble, you cannot walk the thin line \nbetween successfully addressing health needs, and causing over-medicalization \n(p23). But try hard to assemble suffi  cient evidence to maximize the chances of \nbeing lucky. Lucky gambling is a requisite for successful doctoring and the casino \nof medical practice celebrates the card counter. But the cardinal clinical virtue \nis courage: without it we would not follow our hunches and take justi\ufb01 ed risks.\nThe doctor as a gambler", "text_length": 4306, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 33/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.911219", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.912621", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
