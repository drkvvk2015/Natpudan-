Arteritis of the vasa nervorum (arterial supply to peripheral nerves) \nmay cause mononeuritis multiplex or a sensorimotor polyneuropathy.53\nGU: Orchitis\u2014testicular pain or tenderness.\nFeatures of vasculitis\nFig 12.16 Renal angiogram showing \nmultiple aneurysms in PAN.\nCourtesy of Dr William Herring.\nFig 12.17 Livedo reticularis: pink\u2013blue \nmottling caused by capillary dilata-\ntion and stasis in skin venules. Causes: \nphysio l ogical, cold, or vasculitis.\nPMR is not a true vasculitis and its pathogenesis is unknown. PMR and GCA share \nthe same demographic characteristics and, although separate conditions, the two \nfrequently occur together.\nFeatures: Age >50yrs; subacute onset (<2 weeks) of bilateral aching, tenderness, \nand morning stiff ness in shoulders, hips, and proximal limb muscles \u00b1 fatigue, fe-\nver, \ue001weight, anorexia, and depression. There may be associated mild poly arthritis, \ntenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (10%). Weakness is not a feature.\nInvestigations: \ue000CRP, ESR typically >40 (but may be normal); AlkP is \ue000 in 30%. Note \ncreatinine kinase levels are normal (helping to distinguish from myositis/myopathies).\nDifferential diagnoses: Recent-onset RA, polymyositis, hypothyroidism, primary \nmuscle disease, occult malignancy or infection, osteoarthritis (especially cervical \nspondylosis, shoulder OA), neck lesions, bilateral subacromial impingement (OHCS \np666), spinal stenosis (OHCS p676).\nManagement: Prednisolone 15mg/d PO. Expect a dramatic response within 1 \nweek and consider an alternative diagnosis if not. \ue001 dose slowly, eg by 1mg/month \n(according to symptoms/ESR). Investigate apparent \u2018\ufb02 ares\u2019 during withdrawal\u2014 \nattributable to another condition? Most need steroids for \u22652yrs, so give bone pro-\ntection. Addition of methotrexate may be considered, under specialist supervision, \nfor patients at risk of relapse/prolonged therapy. NSAIDS are not eff ective. Inform \npatients to seek urgent review if symptoms of GCA develop.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)", "text_length": 2876, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 565/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 564, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.147275", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.148000", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
