The aim is to minimize bias and attempt to get at \nthe truth as to whether the intervention is any good or not. Both groups are followed \nup and analysed against prede\ufb01 ned end-points.\nRandomizing Done with the aim of eliminating the eff ects of non-studied factors. \nWith randomization (and suffi  cient study size) the two arms of the study will be \nidentical (on average), with the exception of the intervention of interest.\nBlinding There is a risk that factors during the trial may aff ect the outcome, eg \nparticipant or clinician optimism if they know the patient is on active treatment, or \nan unwillingness to expose more severe disease to placebo. If the subject does not \nknow which intervention they are having, the trial is single-blind. Ideally, the experi-\nmenter should not know either, and the study should be double-blind.\n\ue007In a good trial, the blind lead the blind.\nWhen a randomized controlled trial might not be the best method\n  \u2022 Generating new ideas beyond current paradigms (case reports).\n  \n\u2022 Researching causes of illnesses and prognoses (cohort studies).\n  \n\u2022 Evaluating diagnostic tests (cohort study and decision model).\n  \n\u2022 Where the researcher has no idea of the eff ective dose of a drug (dose-ranging \nadaptive design).\n  \n\u2022 When recruiting of patients would be impossible or unethical. \n  \u2022 When personalized medicine is the aim, eg treatments matched to patients\u2019 bio-\nmarker pro\ufb01 les (adaptive design, cohort study).\n\ue007In the end, all randomized trials have to submit to the ultimate test when the sta-\ntistical collides with the personal: \u2018Will this treatment help me?\u2019, \u2018Will this procedure \nhelp you?\u2019 No randomized trial is complete until real-life decisions taken in the light \nof its \ufb01 ndings are scrutinized. Remember Osler: \u2018no two individuals react alike and \nbehave alike under the abnormal conditions which we know as disease. This is the \nfundamental dif\ufb01 culty of the physician\u2019. Do not ask for de\ufb01 nitive trials: everything \nis provisional.\n  \n\u2022 Does the study answer a useful question? Does it add to current literature: big-\nger, better, diff erent target population?\n  \n\u2022 Does the target population in the study include your patient(s)? Check the inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria including age and comorbidity.\n  \n\u2022 Is the intervention well described so it can be replicated in clinical practice?\n  \n\u2022 Was the sample size big enough to detect an eff ect? Can you \ufb01 nd a sample size \ncalculation? Watch out for sub-group analyses for which the sample size was \nnot calculated.\n  \n\u2022 Were outcome measures prede\ufb01 ned?\n  \n\u2022 Is randomization adequate? Look at the baseline data for each group\u2014are there \nsigni\ufb01 cant diff erences? Are any parameters of interest (that might aff ect out-\ncome) not included?\n  \n\u2022 Who was blinded and how blind were they?\n  \n\u2022 Are statistical methods reported and appropriate? There should be a measure of \nthe eff ect size and its precision (con\ufb01 dence interval, see p20).\n  \n\u2022 Is the eff ect clinically signi\ufb01 cant? Watch out for surrogate end-points which do \nnot directly measure bene\ufb01 t, harm, or the treatment response of interest.\n  \n\u2022 How long was the follow-up? Was it long enough to determine outcome?\n  \n\u2022 How complete was the follow-up? How many patients were left at the end of \nthe follow-up period? Were those who left the study included in the analysis \n(intention-to-treat)?25\nJournal club: how good is this RCT?", "text_length": 3832, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 31/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.907702", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.909006", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
