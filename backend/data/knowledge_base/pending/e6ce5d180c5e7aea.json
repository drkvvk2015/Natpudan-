They are larger than bacteria (eg 8\u03bcm \nacross), and mostly reproduce by budding of germ tubes (\ufb01 g 9.21), not by \ufb01 ssion. \nYeasts occur as single cells or as clusters. Hyphae often occur in a mass of cells \n(called moulds). A hyphal cell with cross-walls is called a mycelium. Some yeasts \nare dimorphic: single cells at 37\u00b0C but forming structures called mycelia, contain-\ning fruiting bodies (hyphae), at room temperature. \nFacts of life for \u2018budding\u2019 mycologists\nFig 9.21 Germ tubes emerging from di-\nmor ph ic Candida albicans blastospores.\nCourtesy of P-Y Guillaume.\nFig 9.18 Candida of the glans.\nCourtesy of P-Y Guillaume.\nFig 9.19 Web-space candida.\nCourtesy of A Huntley.\nFig 9.20 Pityriasis versicolor.\nReproduced from Lewis-Jones (ed), Paediatric \nDermatology 2010, with permission from \nOxford University Press.\nInvasion: fungus in normally sterile tissues.\nDissemination: infection of remote organs via haematogenous spread.\n\ue007Suspect an invasive fungal infection in:\n1   Any patient with risk factors (see table 9.15).\n2   Any systemically unwell patient who fails to respond to antibiotic therapy.\n3   Any persistently febrile patient with no microbiological evidence of infection.\nTable 9.15 Risk factors associated with invasive fungal infection. \nRisk factor\nIncludes\nInfection\nHIV, CMV, TB, colonization/inadequate treatment of super\ufb01 cial \nfungal disease, broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior fungal infection.\nMalignancy\nNeutropenia, mucositis, haematological malignancy.\nCritical illness\n\ue000Mortality prediction score (eg APACHE), prolonged ITU admis-\nsion, prolonged ventilation, severe trauma/pancreatitis.\nCatheter\nCentral venous catheter, urinary catheter, dialysis access, TPN.\nTransplantation\nImmunosuppressant medication, recent rejection, graft-versus-\nhost disease.\nGenetic\nHereditary chronic granulomatous disease, abnormalities in \ntumour necrosis factor/interleukins/cytokines.\nSurgical\nMajor surgery, GI perforation, anastomotic leak, length of \ntransplant operation, delayed closure.\nOther comorbidity Any disease managed with immunosuppressive therapy, burns.\nData source: Ramana KV et al.
