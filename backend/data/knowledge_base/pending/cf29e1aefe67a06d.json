Patients bene\ufb01 t directly from a tiny fraction of these papers. \nHow do we \ufb01 nd them?\n  \u2022 A hierarchy of evidence \n(\ufb01 g 1.3) is used to identify \nthe best research available \nto answer our question.\n  \n\u2022 Specialist EBM journals, \neg Evidence-based Med-\nicine, appraise published \ninformation for quality, \nrelevance, and interest on \nour behalf.\n  \u2022 The Cochrane Collabora-\ntion gathers and summa-\nrizes best evidence, free \nfrom commercial spon-\nsorship and con\ufb02 icts of \ninterest. >37 000 research-\ners from 130 countries \ncontribute.\nProblems:\n  \n\u2022 The concept of scienti\ufb01 c rigour is opaque. What do we want? The science, the \nrigour, the truth, or what will be most useful to patients? These may overlap, but \nthey are not the same. Can average cohort results inform clinical decisions on an \nindividual level (especially in the context of comorbidity)?\n  \n\u2022 Can we really appraise ALL the evidence? 27 We are hindered by publication bias. \nAround half of all clinical trials remain unpublished. See www.alltrials.net for the cam-\npaign to register all trials, and ensure methods and summary results are available.\n  \n\u2022 Evidence can be expensive. Who paid the bill and what is their vested interest?\n  \n\u2022 Is the result clinically signi\ufb01 cant? What is the level of bene\ufb01 t to the individual, as \nopposed to the population? Is the EBM tail wagging the clinical dog?\n  \n\u2022 How is our innate hierarchy of evidence constructed? Do we maintain the same \nstandard of the evidence for all changes to our practice? \n  \n\u2022 Have you checked the correspondence columns in journals from which winning \npapers are extracted? It may take years for unforeseen \ufb02 aws to surface.\n  \n\u2022 There is a danger that by always asking, \u2018What is the evidence?\u2019, we will divert \nresources from hard-to-prove areas (eg psychosocial interventions).\n  \n\u2022 EBM is never 100% up to date and reworking meta-analyses takes time and mon-\ney. Specialists may ostensibly reject a new trial due to a tiny \ufb02 aw, when the real \ndread is that it might \ufb02 ip their once-perfect formulation.\n  \n\u2022 EBM lies uncomfortably in a world of clinical intuition and instinctual premoni-\ntion. Yet these instincts may be vital.\n  \n\u2022 If EBM is prescriptive, patient choice declines. Does our zeal for EBM make us ar-\nrogant, mechanical, and defensive? Where is the shared decision-making (p7)?\n  \n\u2022 By focusing on answerable questions, EBM can distract us from our patients\u2019 un-\nanswerable questions; questions that still require time and acknowledgement.\n\ue007The practice of EBM must be informed by clinical judgement and compassion.\nFig 1.3 Hierarchy of evidence.\nEBM Pyramid and EBM Page Generator, copyright 2006 Trustees of \nDartmouth College and Yale University.", "text_length": 3355, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 34/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 33, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.913237", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.914019", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
