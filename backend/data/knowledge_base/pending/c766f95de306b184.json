Abnormal haemodynamics causes splanchnic and systemic \nvaso dilation, but renal vasoconstriction. Bacterial translocation, cytokines, and \nmesenteric angiogenesis cause splanchnic vasodilation, and altered renal auto-\nregulation is involved in the renal vasoconstriction.\nTypes of HRS: HRS 1 is a rapidly progressive deterioration in circulatory and renal \nfunction (median survival <2wks), often triggered by other deteriorating patholo-\ngies. Terlipressin resists hypovolaemia. Haemodialysis may be needed. HRS 2 is a \nmore steady deterioration (survival ~6 months). Transjugular intrahepatic porto-\nsystemic stent shunting may be required (TIPS, p257).\nOther factors in cirrhosis may contribute to poor renal function (p277).\nTransplants: Liver transplant may be required.
