Ob-\nserve the height and the waveform of the pulse. JVP observations are often diffi  cult. \nso do not be downhearted if the skill seems to elude you. Examine necks, and the \npatterns you see may slowly \nstart to make sense\u2014see \n\ufb01 g 2.11 for the local venous \nanatomy. \nConcomitantly \npalpate the arterial pulse to \nhelp decipher patterns.\nThe height\nObserve the patient at 45\u00b0, \nwith their head turned \nslightly to the left and neck \nrelaxed. Good lighting and \ncorrect positioning are key. \nLook for the right internal \njugular vein as it passes just medial to the clavicular head of the sterno cleidomastoid \nup behind the angle of the jaw to the earlobes. The JVP is assessed by measuring the \nvertical height from the manubriosternal angle (not the sternal notch) to the top of \nthe pulse. Pressure at zero (at the sternal angle) is 5cm, so add the height of the JVP \nwith 5cm to obtain the right heart \ufb01 lling pressure in cm of water. A pressure above \n9cm (4cm above the sternal angle at 45\u00b0) is elevated.\nIs the pulse venous (and not arterial)?\n  \n\u2022 Usually impalpable, and obliterated by \ufb01 nger pressure on the vessel.\n  \n\u2022 Rises transiently with pressure on abdomen (abdominojugular re\ufb02 ux)\n2 or on liver \n(hepatojug ular re\ufb02 ux), and alters with posture and respiration (disappears when \npatient sits from lying \ufb02 at).\n  \n\u2022 Usually has a double pulse for every arterial pulse. See \ufb01 g 2.12.\nAbnormalities of the JVP\n  \n\u2022 Raised JVP with normal waveform: Fluid overload, right heart failure.\n  \n\u2022 Fixed raised JVP with absent pulsation: SVC obstruction (p528).\n  \n\u2022 Large a wave: Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis.\n  \n\u2022 Cannon a wave: When the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve, \nlarge \u2018cannon\u2019 a waves result. Causes\u2014complete heart block, single chamber ven-\ntricular pacing, ventricular arrhythmias/ectopics.\n  \n\u2022 Absent a wave: Atrial \ufb01 brillation.\n  \n\u2022 Large v waves: Tricuspid regurgitation\u2014look for earlobe movement.\n  \n\u2022 Constrictive pericarditis: High plateau of JVP (which rises on inspiration\u2014Kuss-\nmaul\u2019s sign) with deep x and y descents.\n  \n\u2022 Absent JVP: When lying \ufb02 at, the jugular vein should be \ufb01 lled. If there is reduced \ncirculatory volume (eg dehydration, haemorrhage) the JVP may be absent.\n2 This sign was \ufb01 rst described by Pasteur in 1885 in the context of tricuspid incompetence.\nPosterior\nauricular vein\nSuper\ufb01cial\ntemporal vein\nMaxillary vein\nFacial vein\nThyroid\ncartilage\nAnterior\njugular vein\nRetromandibular\nvein\nExternal\njugular vein\nInternal\njugular vein\nFig 2.11 The jugular venous system.\nFig 2.12 The jugular venous pressure wave. The JVP drops as the X descent during \nventricular systole because the right atrium is no longer contracting. This means \nthat the pressure in the right atrium is dropping and this is re\ufb02 ected by the JVP.\nAfter Clinical Examination, Macleod, Churchill and Aids to Undergraduate Medicine, J Burton, Churchill.", "text_length": 3128, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 55/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 54, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.953488", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.954224", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
