Thyrotoxicosis causes alkalaemia because of hyperventilation.7\nDiagnose and treat the underlying cause. If Ca\n2+ >3.5mmol/L and symptomatic:\n1   Correct dehydration: If dehydrated give IV 0.9% saline.\n2   Bisphosphonates: These prevent bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast ac-\ntivity. A single dose of pamidronate lowers Ca\n2+ over 2\u20133d; maximum eff ect is \nat 1wk. Infuse slowly, eg 30mg in 300mL 0.9% saline over 3h via a largish vein. \nMax dose 90mg (see table 14.4). Zoledronic acid is signi\ufb01 cantly more eff ective \nin reducing serum Ca\n2+ than previously used bisphosphonates.8 Usually, a single \ndose of 4mg IV (diluted to 100mL, over 15min) will normalize plasma Ca\n2+ within \na week.

Steroids are \nused in sarcoidosis, eg prednisolone 40\u201360mg/d. Salmon calcitonin acts similar-\nly to bisphosphonates, and has a quicker onset of action, but is now rarely used. \nNB: the use of furosemide is contentious, as supporting RCT evidence is scant.9,10 \nIt helps to promote renal excretion of Ca\n2+, but can exacerbate hypercalcaemia \nby worsening dehydration. Thus it should only be used once fully rehydrated, \nand with concomitant IV \ufb02 uids (eg 0.9% saline 1L/4\u20136h). Avoid thiazides.\nTable 14.4 Disodium pamidronate doses\nCalcium (mmol/L; corrected) Single-dose pamidronate (mg)\n<3\n15\u201330\n3\u20133.5\n30\u201360\n3.5\u20134\n60\u201390\n>4\n90\nTreating acute hypercalcaemia", "text_length": 2374, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 685/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 684, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.346973", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.348026", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
