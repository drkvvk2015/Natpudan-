An ET tube (orange) \nshould sit 3\u20137cm above the carina; this one is slightly high. The tip of the CVC (red, here a right \ninternal jugular line) should lie in the SVC, as seen here, or just in the right atrium. The tip of the NG \ntube (green) must be seen below the diaphragm to ensure it is placed in the oesophagus, not the \ntrachea. Do not confuse external leads (blue) with internal lines.\nFig 16.6 Image from ICU showing ET tube, CVC, and NG tube in situ with ECG leads placed across the \nchest. \nImage courtesy of Dr Elen Thomson, Leeds Teaching Hospitals.", "text_length": 724, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 735/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 734, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.439179", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.440075", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
