All hospitals should include this information in your induction but \ncheck how the machine on your ward works.\nIndications To restore sinus rhythm if VF/VT; AF, \ufb02 utter, or supraventricular tachy-\ncardias if other treatments (p126) have failed, or there is haemodynamic compro-\nmise (p130 & p806). This may be done as an emergency, \neg VF/VT, or electively, eg AF.\nAim To completely depolarize the heart using a direct \ncurrent.\nProcedure \ue022For VF/pulseless VT follow the ALS algo-\nrithm on p894 and call the arrest team!\n  \u2022 Unless critically unwell, conscious patients require a \ngeneral anaesthetic or monitored heavy sedation.\n  \n\u2022 If elective cardioversion of AF ensure adequate antico-\nagulation beforehand.\n  \n\u2022 Almost all de\ufb01 brillators are now paddle-free and use \n\u2018hands-free\u2019 pads instead (less chance of skin arc than \njelly). Place the pads on chest, one over apex (p39) and \none below right clavicle. The positions are often given \nby a diagram on the reverse of the pad.\nCardioversion: Synchronize the shock with the rhythm \nby pressing the \u2018SYNC\u2019 button on the machine. This en-\nsures the shock does not initiate a ventricular arrhyth-\nmia. However, this only works for cardioversion; if the \nsync mode is engaged in VF, the de\ufb01 brillator will not \ndischarge.\n  \n\u2022 Monophasic de\ufb01 brillators: (\ufb01 g 18.10) Set the energy \nlevel at 360J for VF/VT (\ue022arrest situation); 200J for AF; 50J for atrial \ufb02 utter.\n  \n\u2022 Biphasic de\ufb01 brillators: (\ufb01 g 18.11) Impedance is less with a biphasic shock and \n120\u2013200J is used for shocks for VF/VT. They use less energy and are just as eff ective \nas monophasic de\ufb01 bs in cardio version. 120\u2013200J will cardiovert most arrhythmias.\n  \n\u2022 Automatic external de\ufb01 brillators: (AEDS) Can be used by anyone who can turn \nthem on and apply the pads. Follow the instructions given by the AED.\nShocking\n1   Consider anticoagulation in AF (see p130).\n2   Clearly state that you are charging the de\ufb01 brillator.\n3   Make sure no one else is touching the patient, the bed, or anything is in turn \ntouching these.\n4   Clearly state that you are about to shock the patient.\n5   Give the shock. If there is a change in rhythm before you shock and the shock \nis no longer required, turn the dial to \u2018discharge\u2019. Do not allow anyone to ap-\nproach until the reading has dropped to 0J.\n6   After a shock: \ue022in resuscitation, resume CPR immediately and do not reassess \nrhythm until the end of the cycle (see p894, \ufb01 g A3); in cardioversion, watch \nECG; consider need to repeat the shock. Up to three are usual for AF/\ufb02 utter.\n7   Get an up-to-date 12-lead ECG.\n\ue007In children, use 4J/kg in VF/VT; see OHCS p239.\nFig 18.10 The dampened sine \nmonophasic waveform.\nFig 18.11 Rectilinear bipha-\nsic waveform with truncated \nexponential decay.
