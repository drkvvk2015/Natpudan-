In practice, patients with single-\nvessel coronary artery disease and normal LV function usually undergo PCI, and \nthose with triple-vessel disease and abnormal LV function more often undergo \nCABG. \nCompared with PCI, CABG results in longer recovery time and length of inpatient \nstay. Recent RCTs indicate that early procedural mortality rates and 5-year survival \nrates are similar after PCI and CABG. Compared with PCI, CABG probably provides \nmore complete long-term relief of angina in patients, and less repeated revascu-\nlarization.\nProcedure: The heart is usually stopped and blood pumped arti\ufb01 cially by a ma-\nchine outside the body (cardiac bypass). Minimally invasive thoracotomies not \nrequiring this are well described, 21 but randomized trials are few. The patient\u2019s \nown saphenous vein or internal mammary artery is used as the graft. Several \ngrafts may be placed. >50% of vein grafts close in 10yrs (low-dose aspirin helps \nprevent this). Internal mammary artery grafts last longer (but may cause chest-\nwall numbness).\nOn-pump or off-pump:\nSeems to make little diff erence. 22\nAfter CABG: If angina persists or recurs (from poor graft run-off , distal disease, \nnew atheroma, or graft occlusion) restart antianginal drugs, and consider an-\ngioplasty. Ensure optimal management of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipi-\ndaemia, and that smoking is addressed. Continue aspirin 75mg OD inde\ufb01 nitely; \nconsider clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated. Mood, sex, and intellectual prob-\nlems 23 are common early.
