Family history? Pain? Nipple \ndischarge? Nipple inversion? Skin changes? Change \nin size related to menstrual cycle? Number of \npregnancies? First/last/latest period? Postnatal? \nBreast feeding? Drugs (eg HRT)? Consider metastatic \ndisease (weight loss, breathlessness, back pain, \nabdominal mass?)\nBreast pain\n(see BOX \u2018Breast pain\u2019)\nSOCRATES (p36). Bilateral/unilateral? Rule out cardiac \nchest pain (p94 & p784). History of trauma? Any \nmass? Related to menstrual cycle?\nNipple discharge\n(see BOX \u2018Nipple discharge\u2019)\nAmount? Nature (colour? consistency? any blood?)\nPast history Any previous lumps and/or malignancies. Previous mammograms, \nclinical examinations of the breast, USS, \ufb01 ne-needle aspirate (FNA)/core biopsies.\nDrug history Ask speci\ufb01 cally about HRT and the Pill.\nFamily history See p520.\nSocial history Try to gain an impression of support network if suspect malignancy.\nCauses: Duct ectasia (green/brown/red, often multiple ducts and bilateral), intra-\nductal papilloma/adenoma/carcinoma (bloody discharge, often single duct), lacta-\ntion. Management: Diagnose the cause (mammogram, ultrasound, ductogram); \nthen treat appropriately. Cessation of smoking reduces discharge from duct ecta-\nsia. Microdochectomy/total duct excision can be considered if other measures fail, \nthough may give no improvement in symptoms.\nNipple discharge\nIs it premenstrual (cyclical mastalgia, OHCS p254)? Breast cancer (refer, eg, for \nmammography if needed)? If non-malignant and non-cyclical, think of:\n  \n\u2022 Tietze\u2019s syndrome  (costochondritis plus swelling of the costal cartilage)\n  \n\u2022 Bornholm disease/Devil\u2019s grip (Coxsackie B virus, causing chest and abdominal \npain, which may be mistaken for cardiac pain or an acute surgical abdomen.
