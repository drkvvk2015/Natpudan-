It may be 1\u00b0 (age-related) or 2\u00b0 to another \ncondition or drugs. If trabecular bone is aff ected, crush fractures of vertebrae are \ncommon (hence the \u2018littleness\u2019 of little old ladies and their dowager\u2019s hump); if cortical \nbone is aff ected, long bone fractures are more likely, eg femoral neck: the big cause of \ndeath and orthopaedic expense (80% hip fractures in the UK occur in women >50yrs).\nPrevalence (In those >50yrs): \ue032 6%, \ue033 18%. Women lose trabeculae with age, but \nin men, although there is reduced bone formation, numbers of trabeculae are stable \nand their lifetime risk of fracture is less. \nRisk factors Age-independent risk factors for 1\u00b0 osteoporosis: parental history, \nalcohol >4 units daily, rheumatoid arthritis, BMI <19, prolonged immobility, and un-\ntreated menopause. See BOX \u2018Osteoporosis risk factors\u2019 for other risk factors, includ-\ning for 2\u00b0 osteoporosis.\nInvestigations X-ray (low sensitivity/speci\ufb01 city, often with hindsight after a \nfracture). Bone densitometry (DEXA\u2014see BOX \u2018DEXA bone densitometry\u2019; table 14.5). \nBloods: Ca\n2+, PO4\n3\u03a9, and ALP normal. Consider speci\ufb01 c investigations for 2\u00b0 causes \nif suggestive history. Biopsy is unreliable and unnecessary with non-invasive tech-\nniques available.\nManagement Loss of bone mineral density may not be entirely irreversible. Age, \nnumber of risk factors, and bone mineral density (DEXA scan; see BOX \u2018DEXA bone den-\nsitometry\u2019) guide the pharmacological approach (eg FRAX, which is a WHO risk assess-\nment tool for estimating 10-yr risk of osteoporotic fracture in untreated patients; see \nwww.shef.ac.uk/frax),13,14 although DEXA is not necessary if age >75yrs. Lifestyle measures \nshould apply to all (including those at risk but not yet osteoporotic).\nLifestyle measures:\n  \n\u2022 Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.\n  \n\u2022 Weight-bearing exercise may increase bone mineral density.15\n  \n\u2022 Balance exercises such as tai chi reduce risk of falls.\n  \n\u2022 Calcium and vitamin D-rich diet (use supplements if diet is insuffi  cient\u2014see \u2018Phar-\nmacological measures\u2019 later in this topic).\n  \n\u2022 Home-based fall-prevention programme, with visual assessment and a home visit. \nNB: hip-protectors are unreliable for preventing fractures.16\nPharmacological measures:\n  \n\u2022 Bisphosphonates: alendronic acid is 1st line (10mg/d or 70mg/wk; not if eGFR <35). \nUse also for prevention in long-term steroid use. If intolerant, try etidronate or rise-\ndronate. Tell patient to swallow pills with plenty of water while remaining upright for \n>30min and wait 30min before eating or other drugs. (SE: photosensitivity; GI upset; \noesophageal ulcers\u2014stop if dysphagia or abdo pain; rarely, jaw osteonecrosis).\n  \n\u2022 Calcium and vitamin D: rarely used alone for prophylaxis, as questionable effi  cacy \nand some evidence of a small \ue000CV risk. Off er if evidence of de\ufb01 ciency, eg calcium \n1g/d + vit D 800U/d. Target serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level \u226575nmol/L.\n  \u2022 Strontium ranelate: due to an increased risk of cardiac problems it should only be used \nin those with severe intolerance of other agents and without cardiovascular disease.\n  \n\u2022 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent (not treat) osteoporosis in post-\nmenopausal women. Relative risk of breast cancer is 1 . 4 if used >10yrs; \ue000 CV risk.\n  \n\u2022 Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts similarly to \nHRT, but with \ue001 breast cancer risk.\n  \n\u2022 Teriparatide (recombinant PTH) is useful in those who suff er further fractures de-\nspite treatment with other agents. There is a potential \ue000 risk of renal malignancy.\n  \n\u2022 Calcitonin may reduce pain after a vertebral fracture.\n  \n\u2022 Testosterone may help in hypo gonadal men by promoting trabecular connectivity.\n  \n\u2022 Denosumab, a monoclonal Ab to RANK ligand, given SC twice yearly \ue001 reabsorption.", "text_length": 3977, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 690/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 689, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.356162", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.357187", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
