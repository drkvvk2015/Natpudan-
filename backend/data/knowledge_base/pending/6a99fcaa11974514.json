Consequently and all too often, attempts to acquire (and \ntest) medical knowledge may promote these antibody panels to a position as the \n\ufb01 nal arbiter of disease diagnosis which, with their varying sensitivities and spe-\nci\ufb01 cities, they are quite un\ufb01 t to assume. Indeed, often just such a work-up shows \nstrange overlap conditions between apparently diff erent diseases: strange until we \nrealize that these markers are just surrogates for processes that we lack a complete \naetiological explanation for and in which the antibodies themselves may just be \nbystanders. Process that we lack the tools to visualize, as cells of the immune system \ncontinue their onslaught against their perceived enemies, driven by reasons that \nnone present seem willing to reveal to our crude probing with blood tests, X-rays \nand biopsies. While the body knows no diseases, only pain and death, our minds \nattempt to impose a unitary disease on unsuspecting and sometimes innocent cells.\nFor example, clinically we observe that autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) frequently \noverlaps with PSC and IBD. A battery of antibody tests may sometimes help \nunderstand the dominant process, but equally may mystify matters still further if \nwe attempt to apply our inadequate classi\ufb01 ers (\u2018But why is the ANCA not positive?\u2019 \ncries the student, enraged at the failure of the miserable patient\u2019s B lymphocytes \nto do the honourable thing).
