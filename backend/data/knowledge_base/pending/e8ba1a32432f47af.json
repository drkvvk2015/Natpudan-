Usual dose range: 300\u2013600mcg IV over 3\u20136min (up to 1mg; \n2mg if on ICU). May provoke \ufb01 ts. Use only after expert advice.\n\ue020-blockers Severe bradycardia or hypotension. Try atropine up to 3mg IV. Give \nglucagon 2\u201310mg IV bolus + 5% glucose if atropine fails then infusion of 50mcg/\nkg/h. Also consider including phosphodiesterase inhibitor infusions (eg enoximone \n5\u201320mcg/kg/min). If unresponsive, consider pacing.\nCyanide This fast-killing poison has affi  nity for Fe\n3+, and inhibits the cytochrome \nsystem, \ue001aerobic respiration (therefore patients are acidotic with raised lactate). \nDepending on degree of poisoning presentation can be:\n  \n\u2022 Mild: Dizziness, anxiety, tachycardia, nausea, drowsiness/confusion.\n  \n\u2022 Moderate: Vomiting, reduced consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis.\n  \n\u2022 Severe: Deep coma, \ufb01 xed unreactive pupils, cardiorespiratory failure, arrhythmias, \npulmonary oedema.\nTreatment: \ue022100% O2, GI deconta mination. If mild, supportive care is usually suf-\n\ufb01 cient. If moderate/severe then speci\ufb01 c treatment to bind cyanide is required. Give \nsodium nitrite/sodium thiosulfate, or dicobalt edetate 300mg IV over 1min, then \n50mL 50% glucose IV (repeat once if no response after a minute); or hydroxocobala-\nmin (Cyanokit\u220f) 5g over 15min repeated once if required. Get expert help. See p847.\nCarbon monoxide Despite hypoxaemia skin is pink (or pale), not blue, as carboxyhae-\nmoglobin (COHb) displaces O2 from Hb binding sites. For the same reasons SpO2 \nfrom a pulse oximeter may be normal. Check ABG in a co-oximeter (ie ensure it meas-\nures haemoglobin, SaO2, Meth-Hb and COHb) which will show low SaO2 and high \nCOHb (normal <5%). Symptoms: Headache, vomiting, \ue000pulse, tachypnoea, and, if \nCOHb >50%, \ufb01 ts, coma, and cardiac arrest.\nTreatment: \ue022Remove the source. Give 100% O2 until COHb <10%. Metabolic acido-\nsis usually responds to correction of hypoxia. If severe, anticipate cerebral oedema \nand give mannitol IVI (p831). Con\ufb01 rm diagnosis with an ABG quickly as levels may \nsoon return to normal. Monitor ECG. If COHb >20%, patient has neurological or psy-\nchological features, or cardiovascular impairment, fails to respond to treatment, or \nis pregnant, consider hyperbaric O2: discuss with the poisons service.\nDigoxin Symptoms: \ue001Cognition, yellow-green visual halos, arrhythmias, nausea, and \nanorexia. If serious arrhythmias are present, correct hypokalaemia, and inactivate \nwith digoxin-speci\ufb01 c antibody fragments (DigiFab\u00ae). If load or level is unknown, give \n20 vials (800mg)\u2014adult or child >20kg.\nHeavy metals Enlist expert help.\nIron Desferrioxamine 15mg/kg/h IVI; max 80mg/kg/d. NB: gastric lavage if iron inges-\ntion in last hour; consider whole-bowel irrigation.\nOral anticoagulants See p351. If major bleed, give vitamin K 5mg slow IV and \nprothrombin complex concentrate 50U/kg IV (or if unavailable, fresh frozen plasma \n15mL/kg IVI). For abnormal INR with no (or minimal) bleeding, see BNF. If it is vital \nthat anticoagulation continues, enlist expert help. Discuss with haematology. NB: \ncoagulation defects may be delayed for 2\u20133d following ingestion.\nOpiates (Many analgesics contain opiates.) Give naloxone, eg 0.4\u20132mg IV; repeat \nevery 2min until breathing is adequate (it has a short t\u00bd, so it may need to be given \noften or IM; max ~10mg). Naloxone may precipitate features of opiate withdrawal\u2014\ndiarrhoea and cramps, which will normally respond to diphenoxylate and atropine \n(eg co-phenotrope). Sedate as needed (see p15). High-dose opiate misusers may need \nmethadone (eg 10\u201330mg/24h PO) to combat withdrawal.
