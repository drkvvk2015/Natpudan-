He noticed that many patients \nwith migratory thrombophlebitis (\u2018Trousseau\u2019s sign\u2019) \ndeveloped gastric cancer. Unfortunately, he developed \nmigratory thrombophlebitis himself and correctly pre-\ndicted his own death from GI malignancy.\nTrousseau\u2019s sign\nBrain metastases\nAff ect up to ~40% of patients with cancer. Most commonly: lung, breast, colorectal, \nmelanoma. Poor prognosis: median survival 1\u20132 months; better prognosis with single \nlesion, breast cancer (see also p830).\nSigns and symptoms: Headache (~50%, often worse in the morning, when cough-\ning or bending), focal neurological signs (~30%), ataxia (~21%), \ufb01 ts (~18%), nausea, \nvomiting, papilloedema.\nManagement: Urgent CT/MRI depending on underlying diagnosis, disease stage, and \nperformance status. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h to reduce cerebral oedema. Stereo-\ntactic radiotherapy (see p527). Discuss with neurosurgery, especially if large lesion \nor associated hydrocephalus.\nTumour lysis syndrome\nChemotherapy for rapidly  proliferating tumours (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma) \nleads to cell death and \ue000urate, \ue000K\n+, \ue000phosphate, \ue001calcium. Risk of arrhythmia and renal \nfailure (see p314).\nManagement: Prevent with hydration and uricolytics, eg rasburicase, allopurinol. \nParaneoplastic syndromes13 (table 11.3) consist of symptoms attributable to a malig-\nnancy mediated by hormones, cytokines, or the cross-reaction of tumour antibodies. \nThey do not correlate with stage/prognosis and may pre-date other cancer symptoms.\nTable 11.3 Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes\nParaneoplastic \nsyndrome\nComment\nMalignancies\nSee\nHypercalcaemia\nParathyroid hormone-related \nprotein secreted by tumour\nLung, oesophagus, \nskin, cervix, breast, \nkidney\np528\nSIADH\nExcessive antidiuretic hormone \n(ADH) secretion causing \ue001Na\n+\nLung, pancreas, lym-\nphomas, prostate\np673\nCushing\u2019s\nsyndrome\nTumour secretes ACTH or CRF, \ncausing adrenal to produce high \nlevels of corticosteroid\nLung, pancreas, \nthymus, carcinoid\np224\nNeuropathy\nAntibody-mediated neuronal \ndegeneration: peripheral, auto-\nnomic, cerebellar\nLung, breast, my-\neloma, Hodgkin\u2019s, GI\np504\nLambert\u2013Eaton\nmyasthenic\nsyndrome\nAntibody to voltage-gated \nion channel on pre-synaptic \nmembrane causes weakness \n(proximal leg most common) \nMostly lung.
