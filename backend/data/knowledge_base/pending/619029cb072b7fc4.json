See \u2018Sepsis\u2019, p792.\nStart smart:\n1   Do not prescribe2 antibiotics in the absence of clinical evidence of bacterial infec-\ntion, or for a self-limiting condition. Take time to discuss:\n  \n\u2022 why an antibiotic is not the best option\n  \n\u2022 alternative options, eg symptomatic treatment, delayed prescribing\n  \n\u2022 the views and expectations of the patient\n  \u2022 safety-netting advice: what the patient should do if their condition deteriorates.\n2   Take microbiological samples before prescribing,1 especially for:\n  \n\u2022 hospital in-patients: review your prescription as soon as MC&S result is available\n  \n\u2022 recurrent or persistent infection\n  \n\u2022 non-severe infection: consider if your prescription can wait for MC&S results.\n3   Follow local guidelines \ufb01 rst: best practice is informed by local epidemiology and \nsensitivities.\n4   Consider bene\ufb01 t and harm for each individual patient:\n  \n\u2022 Allergies: clarify the patient\u2019s reaction\u2014the true incidence of penicillin allergy \nin patients who report that they are allergic is <10%. In those with a con\ufb01 rmed \npenicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with 3rd-generation cephalosporins and car-\nbapenems is possible but rare (<1%).\n  \n\u2022 Dose adjust for renal function and weight: use ideal body weight in extremes of \nBMI (or ideal weight plus a % of excess weight\u2014see local guidelines).\n  \n\u2022 Check for medication interactions.\n  \n\u2022 In pregnancy and lactation, see p17.\n5   Prescribe the shortest eff ective course. Most antibiotics have good oral avail-\nability. Use IV antibiotics only if in line with local or national (sepsis) guidelines.\nThen focus:\nReview the clinical diagnosis and continuing need for antibiotics at 48h for all in-\npatients and all patients prescribed IV antibiotics:\n  \n\u2022 Stop antibiotics if there is no evidence of infection.\n  \n\u2022 Switch from IV to oral whenever possible.\n  \n\u2022 Change to a narrower spectrum antibiotic whenever possible.\n  \n\u2022 Continue regular clinical review whilst antibiotics are prescribed.\nIn England between 2010 and 2014, antibiotic prescribing rose by 4% in general \npractice, 12% in hospitals, and 32% in other healthcare settings; E. coli resistance \nto cipro\ufb02 oxacin increased by 18%, to cephalosporins by 28%, and to gentamicin \nby 27%. 25 000 people in Europe die every year from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. \nEach year ~500 000 develop drug-resistant TB. Cost is the only barrier to buying \ncarbapenems over-the-counter in Egypt, India, and Pakistan.\n\u2018This will be a post-antibiotic era. In terms of new replacement antibiotics, the \npipeline is virtually dry, especially for Gram negative bacteria. The cupboard is \nnearly bare. Prospects for turning this situation around look dim.\u2019\nDr M Chan, Director-General of WHO, March 2012.\nAntimicrobial stewardship2 is necessary in all healthcare settings:\n  \n\u2022 monitoring, evaluation, and feedback on antimicrobial prescribing, bench-\nmarked against up-to-date local and national guidelines\n  \n\u2022 evaluation of high/low levels of prescribing and prescribing outside of guidelines\n  \n\u2022 review of patient safety events: avoidable infection, drug reactions, complica-\ntions of antibiotic therapy, eg MRSA (p388), C. dif\ufb01 cile (p259, p411)\n  \n\u2022 education and decision support systems for all antibiotic prescribers\n  \n\u2022 antibiotic pack sizes that correspond to appropriate course lengths\n  \n\u2022 regular review of all antimicrobial policy, treatment, and prophylaxis guidelines.\nAntimicrobial stewardship\n1 Clinical diagnosis of low-severity community-acquired pneumonia is an exception, see also UTI p296.", "text_length": 3775, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 392/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 391, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.845138", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.846078", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
