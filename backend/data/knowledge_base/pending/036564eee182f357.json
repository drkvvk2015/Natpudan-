Mean \nage of onset: 30yrs. Incidence: 8/100 000/yr. Symptoms may be static for years, but \nthen worsen fast\u2014eg on coughing or sneezing, as \ue000pressure causes extension, eg into \nthe brainstem (syringobulbia, see later in topic).\nCauses Typically, blocked CSF circulation (without 4th ventricular communic-\nation), with \ue001\ufb02 ow from basal posterior fossa to caudal space, eg Arnold\u2013Chiari \nmalformation (cerebellum herniates through foramen magnum); basal arachnoidi-\ntis (after infection, irradiation, subarachnoid haemorrhage); basilar invagination \n(in which the top of the odontoid process of C2 migrates upwards, causing fora-\nmen magnum stenosis \u00b1 medulla oblongata compression); masses (cysts, rheu-\nmatoid pannus, encephalocoele, tumours). Less commonly, a syrinx may develop \nafter myelitis, cord trauma, or rupture of an AV malformation, or within spinal \ntumours (ependymoma or haemangioblastoma) due to \ufb02 uid secreted from neo-\nplastic cells or haemorrhage.\nSigns Dissociated sensory loss (absent pain and T\u00b0 sensation, with preserved \nlight touch, vibration, and joint-position sense) due to pressure from the syrinx \non the decussating antero lateral pathway (\ufb01 g 10.35) in a root dis tribution re\ufb02 ect-\ning the location of the syrinx (eg for typical cervical syrinx then sensory loss is \nover trunk and arms); wasting/weakness of hands \u00b1 claw-hand (then arms\ue003sho-\nulders\ue003respirat ory muscles). Anterior horn cells are also vulnerable. Other signs: \nHorner\u2019s syndrome (can be bilateral and therefore more diffi  cult to spot); UMN leg \nsigns; body asymm etry, limb hemi-\nhyper trophy, or uni lat eral odo- or \nchiromegaly (enlarged hand or foot), \nperhaps from release of trophic fac-\ntors via anterior horn cells; Char-\ncot\u2019s joints in the shoulder/wrist \ndue to lost joint pro prio ception (see \n\ufb01 g 5.11, p213).\nSyringo bulbia (Brain stem involve-\nment.) Nyst agmus, tongue atro-\nphy, dysphagia, pharyngeal/palatal \nweak ness, Vth nerve sensory loss.\nMRI imaging How big is the syrinx? \nAny base-of-brain (Chiari) malfor-\nmation?\nSurgery Don\u2019t wait for gross dete-\nrioration to occur. Decompression at \nthe foramen magnum may be tried \nin Chiari malformat ions to promote \nfree \ufb02 ow of CSF, and so prevent syrinx \ndilatation. Surgery may reduce pain \nand progression.\nFig 10.35 The anterolateral system.", "text_length": 2496, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 524/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 523, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.077347", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.078121", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
