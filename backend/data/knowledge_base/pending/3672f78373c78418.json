Note use of walking aids, symmetry, size of paces, arm \nswing. Ask patient to \u2018walk heel-to-toe as if on a tightrope\u2019 \nto exaggerate any instability. Ask patient to walk on tiptoes, \nthen on heels. Inability to walk on tiptoes indicates S1 or \ngastroc nemius lesion. Inability to walk on heels indicates L4,5 \nlesion or foot drop.\nRomberg\u2019s test: Ask patient to stand unaided with arms by \ntheir sides and close their eyes (be ready to support them). \nIf they sway/lose balance the test is positive and indicates \nposterior column disease/sensory ataxia.\nInspect: Abnormal posturing, muscle wasting, fasciculation \n(LMN lesion?), deformities of the foot (eg pes cavus of Frie-\ndreich\u2019s ataxia or Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease). Is one leg \nsmaller than the other (old polio, infantile hemiplegia)?\n2 Tone\nAsk patient to \u2018relax/go \ufb02 oppy like a rag-doll\u2019. Ask if they have \nany pain in feet/legs/hips before passively \ufb02 exing and extend-\ning each limb while also internally and externally rotating. Hold \nthe patient\u2019s knee and roll it from side to side. Put your hand \nbehind the knee and raise it quickly. The heel should lift slightly \nfrom the bed if tone is normal. Any spasticity/rigidity?\nClonus: Plantar \ufb02 ex the foot then quickly dorsi\ufb02 ex and hold. \nMore than 3 \u2018beats\u2019 of plantar \ufb02 exion is sustained clonus and \nis abnormal. Clonus can also be elicited at the patella with \nrapid downward movement of patella. Hypertonia and clonus \nsuggest an upper motor neuron lesion.\nNeurological examination of the lower limbs\nIf the patient is able, begin your examination by asking the patient to remove their \nlower garments down to underwear, and to walk across the room. Gait analysis \n(p467) gives you more information than any other test. If they aren\u2019t able to walk, \nstart with them lying down, legs fully exposed. Then, Inspection, Tone, Re\ufb02 exes, \nPower, Coordination, Sensation (\ufb01 g 2.32).\n3 Re\ufb02 exes\nFor each re\ufb02 ex, test right, then left and compare. If absent, \nattempt to elicit with \u2018reinforcement\u2019. Decide whether re\ufb02 exes \nare absent/present (with reinforcement)/normal/brisk/exag-\ngerated.\n  \u2022 Knee: (L3,4.) Strike on the patella tendon, just below the \npatella.\n  \n\u2022 Ankle: (L5,S1.) Several accepted methods; ideally ask the \npatient to slightly bend the knee, then drop it laterally, \ngrasp the foot and dorsi\ufb02 ex, then strike the Achilles \ntendon. If hip pain limits mobility, dorsi\ufb02 ex the foot with a \nstraight leg and strike your hand, feeling for an ankle jerk.\n  \n\u2022 Plantar re\ufb02 exes: (L5, S1, S2.) Stroke the patient\u2019s sole with \nan orange stick or similar. The normal re\ufb02 ex is downward \nmovement of the great toe. Babinski\u2019s sign is positive if \nthere is dorsi\ufb02 exion of the great toe (this is abnormal (up-\nper motor neuron lesion) if patient age >6 months).", "text_length": 2980, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 80/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 79, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.999050", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.999998", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
