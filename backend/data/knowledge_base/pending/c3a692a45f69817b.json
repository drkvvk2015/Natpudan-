Faecal\u2013oral \nspread from infected drinking water/food/fomites. Presentation: \nAsymptomatic in the majority. Incubation 1\u20133wks. Diarrhoea, \n\ufb02 atulence, bloating, pain, malabsorption. Duration of symptoms \ntypically ~2\u20136wks. Most common diagnosis if persistent travel-\nler\u2019s diarrhoea (p429). Diagnosis: Stool microscopy for cysts and \ntroph ozoites. Intermittent shedding so multiple samples (\ue0063) may \n\ue000 sensitivity. Faecal immunoassay. PCR for diagnosis/subtype. Duo-\ndenal \ufb02 uid aspirate analysis. Treatment: Hygiene to prevent trans-\nmission. Metronidazole (treatment failure in up to 20%), tinidazole \n(single dose), albendazole (\ue001 side-eff ects, simultaneous treatment \nof other parasites). Lactose-intolerance develops in 20\u201340%. No \ntreatment for asymptomatic disease in endemic areas due to like-\nlihood of re-infection.\nCryptosporidium\nApicomplexan protozoan (\ufb01 g 9.39). Ingestion of oocytes in \ninfected water. Asymptomatic or self-limiting diarrhoea \nin immunocompetent hosts. Chronic/severe diarrhoea \nwith immunosuppression: HIV (p400), transplantation, hy-\npogammaglobulinaemia, immunosuppressive therapy.\nAmoebiasis\nProtozoan Entamoeba histolytica (\ufb01 g 9.40) ~10% world\u2019s \npopulation, mortality ~100 000/yr. Faecal\u2013oral spread. .Boil water to destroy cysts. \nPresentation:\n  \n\u2022 Asymptomatic passage of cysts in ~90% (\u2018luminal amoebiasis\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 Intestinal amoebiasis: dysentery (often insidious onset/relapsing), pain, colitis, ap-\npendicitis, toxic megacolon. Amoeboma = in\ufb02 ammatory abdominal mass, usually \ncaecal/RIF \u00b1 obstruction.\n  \n\u2022 Extra-intestinal (invasive) disease. Amoebic liver abscess in ~1%. Single mass con-\ntaining \u2018anchovy-sauce\u2019 pus. High swinging fever, RUQ pain/tenderness. LFT normal \nor \ue000 (cholestatic). 50% have no history of amoebic dysentery. Also peritonitis (rup-\nture of colonic abscess), pleuropulmonary abscess, cutaneous/genital lesions.\nFig 9.38 Giardia: the \nonly dip lo monadid to \ntrouble us.\nFig 9.40 The lifecycle of Entamoeba histolytica is in two stages: cysts and trophozoites. Cysts \n(10\u201315\u03bcm across) typically contain four nuclei (upper right image). During excystation in the \ngut lumen, nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division, giving rise to eight trophozoites. \nTropho zoites (10\u201350\u03bcm across) contain one nucleus with a central karyosome (lower right image). \nTrophozoites inhabit the caecum and colon. Re-encystation of the trophozoites occurs in the colon, \nand excretion of cysts in faeces perpetuates the lifecycle.\nLeft hand image from Hutson C et al., \u2018Molecular-based diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica infection\u2019, \nExpert Reviews in Molecular Medicine, 1(9): 1\u201311, 1999, reproduced with permission from Cambridge\nUniversity Press.
