This occurs with B12 (p334) and folate de-\n\ufb01 ciency: both are required for DNA synthesis. Another cause is cytotoxic drugs.\n  \n\u2022 Non-megaloblastic: Alcohol excess, reticulocytosis (eg in haemolysis), liver dis-\nease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy.\n  \n\u2022 Other haematological disease: Myelodysplasia (\ufb01 g 8.26), myeloma, myeloprolif-\nerative disorders, aplastic anaemia.\nTests B12 and folate de\ufb01 ciency result in similar blood \ufb01 lm and bone marrow biopsy \nappearances.\nBlood \ufb01 lm: Hypersegmented neutrophils (\ufb01 g 8.25) in B12 and folate de\ufb01 ciency. Target \ncells if liver disease; see \ufb01 g 8.14, p329 and \ufb01 g 8.41, p343.\nOther tests: LFT (include \ue034GT), TFT, serum B12, and serum folate (or red cell folate\u2014a \nmore reliable indicator of folate status, as serum folate only re\ufb02 ects recent intake).\nBone marrow biopsy is indicated if the cause is not revealed by the above tests. It \nis likely to show one of the following four states:\n1   Megaloblastic marrow.\n2   Normoblastic marrow (eg in liver disease, hypothyroidism).\n3   Abnormal erythropoiesis (eg sideroblastic anaemia, p326, leukaemia, aplasia).\n4   Increased erythropoiesis (eg haemolysis).\nFolate Found in green vegetables, nuts, yeast, and liver; it is synthesized by gut \nbact eria. Body stores can last for 4 months. Maternal folate de\ufb01 ciency causes fe-\ntal neural tube defects. It is absorbed by duodenum/proximal jejunum.\nCauses of de\ufb01 ciency:\n  \n\u2022 Poor diet, eg poverty, alcoholics, elderly.\n  \n\u2022 Increased demand, eg pregnancy or \ue000cell turnover (seen in haemolysis, malig-\nnancy, in\ufb02 ammatory disease, and renal dialysis).\n  \n\u2022 Malabsorption, eg coeliac disease, tropical sprue.\n  \u2022 Alcohol.\n  \u2022 Drugs: anti-epileptics (phenytoin, valproate), methotrexate, trimethoprim.\nTreatment: Assess for an underlying cause, eg poor diet, malabsorption. Treat \nwith folic acid 5mg/day PO for 4 months, \ue007never without B12 unless the patient is \nknown to have a normal B12 level, as in low B12 states it may precipitate, or worsen, \nsubacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334). In pregnancy, prophy lactic \ndoses of folate (400mcg/day) are given from conception until at least 12wks; this \nhelps prevent spina bi\ufb01 da, as well as anaemia.\nNB: in unwell patients (eg CCF) with megaloblastic anaemia, it may be necessary to \ntreat before serum B12 and folate results are known. Do tests then treat with large \ndoses of hydroxocobalamin, eg 1mg/48h IM\u2014see BNF, with folic acid 5mg/24h PO. \nBlood transfusions are very rarely needed (see p324).", "text_length": 2864, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 340/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 339, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.748630", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.749297", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
