In a scoring system of 11 nations across 11 catego-\nries, the NHS came \ufb01 rst overall, at less than half the cost per head spent in the USA.1 \nThe King\u2019s Fund debunks the myth that the NHS is unaff ordable in the modern era,2 \nalthough funding remains a political choice. Bevan prophesied, \u2018The NHS will last as \nlong as there are folk left with the faith to \ufb01 ght for it.\u2019 Guard it well.\nDecision and intervention are the essence of action, \nre\ufb02 ection and conjecture are the essence of thought; \nthe essence of medicine is combining these in the ser-\nvice of others. We off er our ideals to stimulate thought \nand action: like the stars, ideals are hard to reach, but \nthey are used for navigation. Orion (\ufb01 g 1.2) is our star \nof choice. His constellation is visible across the globe \nso he links our readers everywhere, and he will remain \nrecognizable long after other constellations have dis-\ntorted.\nMedicine and the stars\nFig 1.2 The const ellation of Orion has three superb stars: Bel-\nlatrix (the stetho scope\u2019s bell), Betel geuse (B), and Rigel (R).
