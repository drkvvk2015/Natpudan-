More than one \nhundred HLA B27 disease associations have been made40, yet the actual role of HLA \nB27 in triggering an in\ufb02 ammatory response is not fully understood. ~5% of the \nUK population are HLA B27 positive\u2014most do not have any disease. The chance of \nan HLA B27 positive person developing spondyloarthritis or eye disease is 1 in 4. \n Common associations include:\nAnkylosing spondylitis: 85-95% of all those with AS are HLA B27 positive.\nAcute anterior uveitis: 50\u201360% are HLA B27 positive.\nReactive arthritis: 60\u201385% are HLA B27 positive.\nEnteric arthropathy: 50\u201360% are HLA B27 positive.\nPsoriatic arthritis: 60\u201370% are HLA B27 positive.\nHLA-B27 disease associations\nFig 12.13 Progression of disease and eff ect on posture in severe ankylosing spondylitis.\nReproduced from American Journal of Medicine 1976:60;279\u201385 with permission from Elsevier.\n3   Psoriatic arthritis (OHCS p594.) Occurs in 10\u201340% with psoriasis and can present \nbefore skin changes. Patterns are: \u2022symmetrical polyarthritis (like RA) \u2022DIP joints \n\u2022asymmetrical oligoarthritis \u2022spinal (similar to AS) \u2022psoriatic arthritis mutilans \n(rare, ~3%, severe deformity). Radiology: Erosive changes, with \u2018pencil-in-cup\u2019 \ndeformity in severe cases. Associated with nail changes in 80%, synovitis (dac-\ntylitis), acneiform rashes and palmo-plantar pustulosis. Management: NSAIDS, \nsulfasalazine, methotrexate. Anti-TNF agents are also eff ective.\n4   Reactive arthritis A condition in which arthritis and other clinical manifesta-\ntions occur as an autoimmune response to infection elsewhere in the body\u2014\ntypically GI or GU, although the preceding infection may have resolved or be \nasymptomatic by the time the arthritis presents. Other clinical features: Iritis, \nkeratoderma blenorrhagica (brown, raised plaques on soles and palms), circinate \nbalanitis (painless penile ulceration secondary to Chlamydia), mouth ulcers, and \nenthesitis. Patients may present with a triad of urethritis, arthritis, and conjunc-\ntivitis (Reiter's syndrome). Tests: \ue000ESR & \ue000CRP. Culture stool if diarrhoea. Infec-\ntious serology. Sexual health review. X-ray may show enthesitis with periosteal \nreaction. Management: There is no speci\ufb01 c cure. Splint aff ected joints acutely; \ntreat with NSAIDS or local steroid injections. Consider sulfasalazine or metho-\ntrexate if symptoms >6 months.
