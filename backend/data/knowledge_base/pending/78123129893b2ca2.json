If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill.\nSigns and symptoms None initially, or vomiting \u00b1 RUQ pain. Later: jaundice and \nencephalopathy from liver damage (the main danger) \u00b1 acute kidney injury (AKI).\nManagement General measures: See p838. GI decontamination is recommended \nin those presenting <4h after overdose: give activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g).\n  \n\u2022 Glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, HCO3\n\u03a9 ; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion.\n  \n\u2022 If <10\u201312h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line \non the graph (see \ufb01 g 19.26), start acetylcysteine.\n  \n\u2022 If >8\u201324h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and \nstart acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal.\n  \n\u2022 If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from inges-\ntion, treatment may still help. \ue007Get advice.\nAcetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15\u201360min; then 50mg/\nkg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. Rash is a \ncommon SE: treat with chlorphenamine + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid \nreaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). An alternative (if acetyl-\ncysteine unavailable) is methionine 2.5g/4h PO for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is \nunreliable if vomiting.\nOngoing management\n  \n\u2022 Next day do INR, U&E, LFT. If INR rising, continue acetylcysteine until <1.4.\n  \n\u2022 If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don\u2019t hesitate to get help.\n  \u2022 Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by eg King\u2019s College criteria (BOX, p275).\nSalicylate poisoning \nAspirin is a weak acid with poor water solubility. It is present in many over-the-\ncounter preparations. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic \nmetabolism and the production of lactate and heat. Eff ects are dose related and \npotentially fatal: \u2022150mg/kg: mild toxicity. \u2022250mg/kg: moderate \u2022>500mg/kg: severe \ntoxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal.\nSigns and symptoms Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features:\n  \n\u2022 Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation, tinnitus, vertigo, sweating.\n  \n\u2022 Rarely \ue001GCS, seizures, \ue001BP and heart block, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia.\nPatients present initially with respiratory alkalosis due to a direct stimulation of \nthe central respiratory centres and then develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia may occur.\nManagement General: (pp838\u20139.) Correct dehydration. Keep patient on ECG monitor. \nGive activated charcoal to all presenting \ue0051h\u2014consider even if delayed presentation, \nslow-release formations, or bezoar formation (can delay absorption): at least one dose \nof 1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart).\n1   Bloods. Paracetamol and salicylate level, glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, HCO3\n\u03a9, FBC. \nSalicylate level may need to be repeated after 2h, due to continuing absorption \nif a potentially toxic dose has been taken. Monitor blood glucose 1\u20132hrly, beware \nhypoglycaemia, if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and U&E.\n2   Urine. Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH.\n3   Correct acidosis. If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe \nmetabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L 1.26% so-\ndium bicarbonate IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5\u20138. NB: monitor serum K\n+ as \nhypokalaemia may occur, and should be treated (caution if AKI).\n4   Dialysis may well be needed if salicylate level >700mg/L, and if AKI or heart \nfailure, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, confusion or seizures, severe acidosis \ndespite best medical therapy, or persistently \ue000plasma salicylate.
