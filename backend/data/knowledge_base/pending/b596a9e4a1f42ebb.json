Autoantibodies are made against a vari-\nety of autoantigens (eg ANA) which form immune complexes . Inadequate clearance \nof immune complexes results in a host of immune responses which cause tissue \nin\ufb02 ammation and damage. Environmental triggers play a part (eg EBV p405).43 \nPrevalence ~0.2%. \ue033:\ue032\u22489:1, typically women of child-bearing age. Commoner in \nAfrican-Caribbeans, Asians, and if HLA B8, DR2, or DR3 +ve. ~10% of patients have a \n1st- or 2nd-degree relative with SLE.\nClinical features See BOX. Remitting and relapsing illness of variable presentation \nand course. Features often non-speci\ufb01 c (malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever) or or-\ngan-speci\ufb01 c and caused by active in\ufb02 ammation or damage. Other features include \nlymphadenopathy, weight loss, alopecia, nail-fold infarcts, non-infective endocarditis \n(Libman\u2013Sacks syndrome), Raynaud\u2019s (30%; see p708), stroke, and retinal exudates.\nImmunology >95% are ANA +ve. A high anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody \ntitre is highly speci\ufb01 c, but only +ve in ~60% of cases. ENA (p553) may be +ve in 20\u201330% \n(anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP); 40% are RhF +ve; antiphospholipid antibodies (an-\nticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant) may also be +ve. SLE may be associated with other \nautoimmune conditions: Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s (15\u201320%), autoimmune thyroid disease (5\u201310%).\nDiagnosis See BOX. Monitoring activity Three best tests: 1 Anti-dsDNA antibody ti-\ntres. 2 Complement: \ue001C3, \ue001C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence \ue001C3 and \ue001C4, \nand \ue000C3d and \ue000C4d, their degradation products). 3 ESR. Also: BP, urine for casts or pro-\ntein (lupus nephritis, below), FBC, U&E, LFTs, CRP (usually normal) \ue007think of SLE when-\never someone has a multisystem disorder and \ue000ESR but CRP normal. If \ue000CRP, think \ninstead of infection, serositis, or arthritis. Skin or renal biopsies may be diagnostic.\nDrug-induced lupus Causes (>80 drugs) include isoniazid, hydralazine (if >50mg/24h \nin slow acetylators), procainamide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, minocycline, phenyto-\nin, anti-TNF agents. It is associated with antihistone antibodies in >95% of cases. Skin \nand lung signs prevail (renal and CNS are rarely aff ected). The disease remits if the \ndrug is stopped. Sulfonamides or the oral contraceptive pill may worsen idiopathic SLE.\nManagement Refer: complex cases should involve specialist SLE/nephritis clinics.\n  \n\u2022 General measures: High-factor sunblock. Hydroxychloroquine, unless contraindi-\ncated, reduces disease activity and improves survival. Screen for co-morbidities \nand medication toxicity. For skin \ufb02 ares, \ufb01 rst trial topical steroids.\n  \n\u2022 Maintenance: NSAIDs (unless renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and \nskin symptoms. Azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-spar-\ning agents. Belimumab (monoclonal antibody) used as an add-on therapy for auto-\nantibody positive disease where disease activity is high.44 (See BOX.)\n  \n\u2022 Mild \ufb02 ares: (No serious organ damage.) Hydroxychloroquine or low-dose steroids.\n  \n\u2022 Moderate \ufb02 ares: (Organ involvement.) May require DMARDs or mycophenolate.\n\ue007\ue007Severe \ufb02 ares: If life- or organ-threatening, eg haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, \nsevere pericarditis or CNS disease; urgent high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, rituxi-\nmab, cyclophosphamide. MDT working vital for neuropsychiatric lupus (psychometric \ntesting, lumbar puncture may be indicated).\nLupus nephritis: (p314.) May require more intensive immunosuppression with ster-\noids and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. BP control vital (e.g. ACE-i). Renal re-\nplacement therapy (p306) may be needed if disease progresses; nephritis recurs in \n~50% post-transplant, but is a rare cause of graft failure.45\nPrognosis: ~80% survival at 15 years.43 There is an increased long-term risk of CVD \nand osteoporosis.\nAntiphospholipid syndrome Can be associated with SLE (20\u201330%). Often occurs \nas a primary disease. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin & lupus antico-\nagulant, anti-\ue020 2 glycoprotein 1) cause CLOTS: Coagulation defect (arterial/venous), \nLivedo reticularis (p557), Obstetric (recurrent miscarriage), Thrombocytopenia. \nThrombotic tendency aff ects cerebral, renal, and other vessels. Dx: Persistent an-\ntiphosphlolipid antibodies with clinical features. \ue057: Anticoagulation; seek advice in \npregnancy.46", "text_length": 4461, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 562/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 561, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.143057", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.143823", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
