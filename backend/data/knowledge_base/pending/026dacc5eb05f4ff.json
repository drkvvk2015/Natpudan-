A pericardial friction rub (p46) may be heard. Look for evidence of \na pericardial eff usion or cardiac tamponade (see later in topic). Fever may occur.\nTests: ECG classically shows concave (saddle-shaped) ST segment elevation and PR \ndepression, but may be normal or non-speci\ufb01 c (10%); see \ufb01 g 3.51. Blood tests: FBC, \nESR, U&E, cardiac enzymes (NB: troponin may be raised); tests relating to possible aeti-\nologies. Cardiomegaly on CXR may indicate a pericardial eff usion. Echo (if suspected \npericardial eff usion). CMR and CT may show localized in\ufb02 ammation.\nTreatment: NSAIDs or aspirin with gastric protection for 1\u20132weeks. Add colchicine \n500mcg OD or BD for 3 months to reduce the risk of recurrence. Rest until symptoms \nresolve. Treat the cause. If not improving or autoimmune, consider steroids (may \nincrease the risk of recurrence) or other immunosuppressive therapies.\nPericardial eff usion Accumulation of \ufb02 uid in the pericardial sac (normally 10\u2013\n50mL).68 Causes: Pericarditis, myocardial rupture (haemopericardium\u2014surgical, \nstab wound, post-MI); aortic dissection; pericardium \ufb01 lling with pus; malignancy.\nClinical features: Dyspnoea, chest pain, signs of local structures being compressed\u2014\nhiccoughs (phrenic N), nausea (diaphragm), bronchial breathing at left base (Ewart\u2019s \nsign: compressed left lower lobe). Muffl  ed heart sounds. Look for signs of cardiac \ntamponade (below).\nDiagnosis: CXR shows an enlarged, globular heart if eff usion >300mL; \ufb01 g 3.14. ECG \nshows low-voltage QRS complexes and may have alternating QRS morphologies (elec-\ntrical alternans). Echocard iography shows an echo-free zone surrounding the heart.\nManagement: Treat the cause. Pericardiocentesis may be diagnostic (suspected \nbacterial pericarditis) or therapeutic (cardiac tamponade). See p773. Send pericar-\ndial \ufb02 uid for culture, ZN stain/TB culture, and cytology.\nConstrictive pericarditis The heart is encased in a rigid pericardium.68\nCauses: Often unknown (UK); elsewhere TB, or after any pericarditis.\nClinical features: These are mainly of right heart failure with \ue000JVP (with prominent \nx and y descents, p43); Kussmaul\u2019s sign (JVP rising paradoxically with inspiration); \nsoft, diff use apex beat; quiet heart sounds; S3; diastolic pericardial knock, hepato-\nsplenomegaly, ascites, and oedema.\nTests: CXR: small heart \u00b1 pericardial calci\ufb01 cation. CT/MRI\u2014helps distinguish from re-\nstrictive cardiomyopathy. Echo. Cardiac catheterization.\nManagement: Surgical excision. Medical \ue057 to address the cause and symptoms.\nCardiac tamponade A pericardial eff usion that raises intrapericardial pressure, \nreducing ventricular \ufb01 lling and thus dropping cardiac output.68 \ue031\ue031 Can lead rapidly \nto cardiac arrest.\nSigns: \ue000Pulse, \ue001BP, pulsus paradoxus, \ue000JVP, Kussmaul\u2019s sign, muffl  ed S1 and S2.\nDiagnosis: Beck\u2019s triad: falling BP; rising JVP; muffl  ed heart sounds. ECG: low-voltage \nQRS \u00b1 electrical alternans. Echo is diagnostic: echo-free zone (>2cm, or >1cm if acute) \naround the heart \u00b1 diastolic collapse of right atrium and right ventricle.\nManagement: Seek expert help. The pericardial eff usion needs urgent drainage \n(p773).
