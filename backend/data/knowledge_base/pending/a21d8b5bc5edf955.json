Can aff ect living \nand necrotic tissue. In south and central America the \nhuman bot\ufb02 y lays its eggs on mosquitoes which de-\nposit them when they bite. In sub-Sahran Africa the \ntumbu \ufb02 y lays its eggs on clothing which then trans-\nfer to skin. Presentation: Painful swelling. May have \nsensation of movement within the lesion. May open \nto reveal larval breathing tubes (\ufb01 g 9.57). Diagnosis: \nClinical. Identi\ufb01 cation of larvae in lesion. Treatment: \nPetroleum or pork fat cause asphyxiation of the mag-\ngot causing it to protrude further out of the skin ena-\nbling removal with tweezers. Care: backward-facing \nspines in American disease may prevent complete \nremoval unless done surgically. Ensure tetanus vac-\ncination is up to date.\nTungiasis\nInfection of the skin by the sand/jigger \ufb02 ea Tunga penetrans. Acquired (usually \nwalking barefoot) in sandy soil, rainforests, and banana plantations in south and \ncentral America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Caribbean. Presentation: Painful, itchy \npapule on the feet. May be visible extrusion of eggs. Black crusting when \ufb02 ea dies. \nDiagnosis: Clinical. Treatment: None, self-limiting.\nLeprosy (Hansen\u2019s disease)\nCaused by slow-growing, acid-fast Mycobacterium leprae which aff ects skin, \nnerves, and mucous membranes. Incubation 5\u201320y. Transmitted via droplets from \nnose/mouth during close and frequent contact. Classi\ufb01 ed as:\n  \n\u2022 Multibacillary (\u2018lepromatous\u2019): \ue001immune response, \ue000bacilli, +ve smear.\n  \n\u2022 Paucibacillary (\u2018tuberculoid\u2019): \ue000immune response, granulomata with \ue001bacilli, \nsmears may be \u03a9ve.\nFree treatment through WHO since 1995: prevalence \ue001 by 99% to 176 000 in 2014 (5.2 \nmillion in 1985).12 Presentation: Hypopigment-\ned skin lesions (\ufb01 g 9.58, less well demarcated \nthan vitiligo), sensory loss, thickened nerves, \nnodules, plaques, nasal congestion, epistaxis, \nmuscle weakness, paralysis, neuropathic ul-\ncers. Eye involvement: chronic iritis, scleritis, \nepiscleritis, \ue001corneal sensation (V nerve palsy), \n\ue001blinking and lagophthalmos (VII nerve palsy), \ntrauma from eyelashes (trichiasis). Diagnosis: \nClinical, +ve skin smear, skin biopsy. Serology \nunreliable. Treatment: WHO multidrug therapy:\n  \n\u2022 Multibacillary: \nRifampicin \n600mg/month, \ndapsone 100mg OD, clofazimine 300mg/month \nand 50mg OD. Duration: 1yr.\n  \u2022 Paucibacillary: \nrifampicin \n600mg/month, \ndapsone \n100mg OD. Duration: 6 months. If single lesion: rifampicin \n600mg+o\ufb02 oxacin 400mg+minocycline 100mg (single dose).\nYaws\nChronic granulomatous disease caused by Treponema \npertenue. Found in humid/rainforest areas in Africa, \nAsia, Latin American, Paci\ufb01 c. Associated with \ue001socio-\neconomic conditions. Transmission via direct contact. \nPresentation: Primary disease = papilloma. If untreated \nwill ulcerate (\ufb01 g 9.59). Secondary disease: yellow skin le-\nsions, dactylitis. cvs and CNS complications do not occur. \nDiagnosis: Serology is indistinguish able from syphilis \n(Treponema pallidum). Dual-path platform (DPP) assay \ncan distinguish between current and past infection. PCR. \nTreatment: Single-dose azithromycin PO.\nFig 9.57 Myiasis.\nReproduced under Creative Commons \nCC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain from \nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Miasis_human.jpg\nFig 9.58 Leprosy: hypopigmented mac-\nules. \nCourtesy of Prof. Jayakar Thoma.\nFig 9.59 Ulceropapilloma-\ntous yaws.\nCourtesy of Dr B Hudson,\nSydney, Australia.", "text_length": 3512, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 449/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 448, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.942679", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.944435", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
