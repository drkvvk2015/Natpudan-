Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothala-\nmus stimulates ACTH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates cortisol \nand androgen production by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is excreted as urinary free \ncortisol and various 17-oxogenic steroids.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome This is the clinical state produced by chronic glucocorticoid \nexcess + loss of the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo\u2013pituitary\u2013\nadrenal axis and loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion (normally highest on \nwaking). The chief cause is oral steroids. Endogenous causes are rare: 80% are due \nto \ue000ACTH; of these a pituitary adenoma (Cushing\u2019s disease) is the commonest cause.\n1   ACTH-dependent causes (\ue000ACTH)\n  \n\u2022 Cushing\u2019s disease: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from an ACTH-secreting pituitary \nadenoma (usually a microadenoma, p234). \ue033:\ue032>1:1. Peak age: 30\u201350yrs. A low-\ndose dexamethasone test (BOX) leads to no change in plasma cortisol, but 8mg \nmay be enough to more than halve morning cortisol (as occurs in normals). \n  \n\u2022 Ectopic ACTH production: Especially small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tum-\nours, p271. Speci\ufb01 c features: pigmentation (due to \ue000\ue000ACTH), hypokalaemic \nmetabolic alkalosis (\ue000\ue000cortisol leads to mineralocorticoid activity), weight loss, \nhyper glycaemia. Classical features of Cushing\u2019s are often absent. Dexamethasone \neven in high doses (8mg) fails to suppress cortisol production.\n  \n\u2022 Rarely, ectopic CRF production: Some thyroid (medullary) and prostate cancers.\n2   ACTH-independent causes (\ue001ACTH due to \u03a9ve feedback)\n  \n\u2022 Iatrogenic: Pharmacological doses of steroids (common).\n  \u2022 Adrenal adenoma/cancer: (May cause abdo pain \u00b1 virilization in \ue033, p230.) Because \nthe tumour is autonomous, dexamethasone in any dose won\u2019t suppress cortisol.\n  \n\u2022 Adrenal nodular hyperplasia: (As for adrenal adenoma, no dexamethasone sup-\npression.)\n  \n\u2022 Rarely: Carney complex, p223. McCune\u2013Albright syndrome, see OHCS p650.\nSymptoms \ue000Weight; mood change (depression, lethargy, irritability, psychosis); \nproximal weakness; gonadal dysfunction (irregular menses; hirsut ism; erectile dys-\nfunction); acne; recurrent Achilles tendon rupture; occasionally virilization if \ue033.\nSigns Central obesity; plethoric, moon face; buff alo hump; supraclavicular fat distri-\nbution; skin & muscle atrophy; bruises; purple abdominal striae (\ufb01 g 5.20); osteoporo-\nsis; \ue000BP; \ue000glucose; infection-prone; poor healing. Signs of the cause (eg abdo mass).\nTests Random plasma cortisols may mislead, as illness, time of day, and stress (eg \nvene puncture) in\ufb02 uence results. Also, don\u2019t rely on imaging to localize the cause: non-\nfunctioning \u2018incidentalomas\u2019 occur in ~5% on adrenal CT and ~10% on pituitary MRI. \nMRI detects only ~70% of pituitary tumours causing Cushing\u2019s (many are too small).\nTreatment Depends on the cause.\n\u2022 Iatrogenic: Stop medications if possible.\n  \n\u2022 Cushing\u2019s disease: Selective removal of pituitary adenoma (trans -sphenoidally). \nBilateral adrenalectomy if source unlocatable, or recurrence post-op (complica-\ntion: Nelson\u2019s syndrome: \ue000skin pigmentation due to \ue000\ue000ACTH from an enlarging pituitary \ntumour, as adrenalectomy removes \u03a9ve feedback; responds to pituitary radiation).\n  \n\u2022 Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma: Adrenalectomy: \u2018cures\u2019 adenomas but rarely \ncures cancer. Radiotherapy & adrenolytic drugs (mitotane) follow if carcinoma.\n  \n\u2022 Ectopic ACTH: Surgery if tumour is located and hasn\u2019t spread. Metyrapone, ketocon-\nazole, and \ufb02 uconazole \ue001cortisol secretion pre-op or if awaiting eff ects of radia-\ntion. Intubat ion + mifepristone (competes with cortisol at receptors) + etomidate \n(blo cks cortisol synthesis) may be needed, eg in severe ACTH-associated psychosis.\nPrognosis Untreated Cushing\u2019s has \ue000vascular mortality.22 Treated, prognosis is good \n(but myopathy, obesity, menstrual irregularity, \ue000BP, osteoporosis, subtle mood chang-\nes and DM often remain\u2014so follow up carefully, and manage individually).", "text_length": 4434, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 232/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 231, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.388580", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.389310", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
