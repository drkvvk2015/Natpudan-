Rather, the examination for splenomegaly is most\nuseful to rule in the diagnosis of splenomegaly among patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of at least\n10%. The examination should always start with percussion. If no dullness is detected on percussion, there is\nno need to palpate as the results of palpation will not effectively rule in or rule out splenic enlargement. If the\npossibility of missing splenic enlargement remains an important clinical concern, then ultrasound or\nscintigraphy is indicated. In the presence of percussion dullness, palpation should follow. If both tests are\npositive, the diagnosis of splenomegaly is established (providing the clinical suspicion of splenomegaly was at\nleast 10% before examination). If palpation is negative, diagnostic imaging will be required to confidently rule\nin or rule out splenomegaly\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 1993 270:18\n164\nSplenomegaly", "text_length": 3582, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 175/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 174, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.486275", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.487021", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
