Be alert to new infections.\nProtect: Isolate multi-antibiotic-resistant microbes (eg MRSA), highly transmissi-\nble infections (eg norovirus), and high-risk groups including reverse barrier nurs-\ning (avoids transmission to, rather than from, patients, eg neutropenia). Patients \nwith high-risk infections may need negative-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially \ninfected air leaving the room), or in severe immunosuppression, positive-pressure \nrooms (to prevent potentially infected air entering the room). When many patients \nhave the same nosocomial infection (eg norovirus) they may be barrier nursed to-\ngether in dedicated bays.\nTreat: Refer to local guidelines, seek expert help. Initial antibiotic choice may diff er \nfor healthcare-associated infection.\nPrevent: Modify risk factors, eg nutrition, post-operative incentive spirometry to \nreduce pneumonia risk. Use/convert to narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever pos-\nsible. Remove catheters, intravascular access devices, and wean off  ventilators as \nsoon as clinically appropriate. Take measures to \ue001 person-to-person transmission:\n1   Hand hygiene. Wash hands before and \nafter each patient contact (\ufb01 g 9.22). \nAlcohol-based gels are helpful but soap is \nneeded to kill C. dif\ufb01 cile spores.\n2   Personal attire. In the UK there is a \nbare-below-the-elbows policy. Long hair \nshould be tied back. In areas where infec-\ntion risk is particularly high (theatre, ICU), \nstaff  change into scrubs on arrival.\n3  Personal protective equipment (PPE).Used \nfor isolated patients and during proce-\ndures. Includes gloves, aprons, caps, res-\npiratory protection/mask according to risk, \neg FFP3 respirators in aerosolized infection.\n4   Procedures. Strict aseptic techniques for any procedure which breaches the \nbody\u2019s defences including insertion/maintenance of invasive devices, IV infusions, \nwound care.\n5   Environment. Should be clean and safe, with eff ective decontamination.\nSystem interventions: Up-to-date infection guidelines, audit, education, training.8\nGram-positive anaerobic bacillus and most common healthcare-associated patho-\ngen. Part of colonic \ufb02 ora in 2\u20135% of healthy adults, and 20\u201340% of hospitalized \nadults. Disease occurs when it converts to a vegetative (growth) state with pro-\nduction of enterotoxins A and B, causing colitis. Typically happens when inhibition \nby competing colonic \ufb02 ora is lost due to antibiotic exposure.\nPresentation: Watery diarrhoea, mild\ue003fulminant colitis (pseudomembranes on \nendoscopy=\u2018pseudomembranous colitis\u2019), ileus, toxic megacolon. Consider in all \ndiarrhoea associated with antibiotic use, especially if marked neutrophilia.\nDiagnosis: Immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (common antigen) de-\ntects all strains of C. dif\ufb01 cile. Detection of toxin (toxin immunoassay, toxin gene \nnucleic acid ampli\ufb01 cation) distinguishes infection from carriage.\nManagement: SIGHT: Suspect, Isolate within 2h, Gloves and aprons, Hand wash \nwith soap, Test immediately.\n  \n\u2022 Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO.\n  \n\u2022 Severe (WCC >15\u2248109/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5oC): vancomycin PO \n(injection preparation can be given orally and is cheaper than capsules) or fidax-\nomicin (\ue000cost).\n  \n\u2022 Non-responders: high-dose vancomycin+IV metronidazole, fidaxomicin, IV immu-\nnoglubulin (no RCT data).\n  \n\u2022 Recurrence: (weaning) vancomycin, \ufb01 daxomicin, faecal transplantation.\nClostridium dif\ufb01 cile\nFig 9.22 Areas commonly missed when \nwashing hands.\nContains public sector information licensed \nunder Open Government Licence v3.0, www.\nwhatdotheyknow.com/request/21861/response/56086/\nattach/3/04072 Hand Hygiene 5 1.1.pdf", "text_length": 3873, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 419/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 418, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.894994", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.895723", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
