These aims should be met with the least possible side-eff ects.\nMechanism of action (See \ufb01 g 9.13.)\n  \n\u2022 CCR5 antagonists inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell by blocking the CCR5 \nco-receptor.\n  \n\u2022 Nucleos(t)ide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, NNR-\nTIs) inhibit reverse transcriptase and the conversion of viral RNA into DNA.\n  \n\u2022 Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit integrase and prevent HIV DNA \nintegrating into the nucleus.\n  \n\u2022 Protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit protease, an enzyme involved in the maturation \nof virus particles.\n  \n\u2022 Pharmacokinetic enhancers/boosters increase the eff ectiveness of antiretroviral \ndrugs allowing lower doses eg cobicistat, ritonavir.\nStarting treatment \ue007Seek expert help.\n4685 participants (215 sites, 35 countries) with HIV, CD4 >500 cells/microlitre, no \nprevious ART.
