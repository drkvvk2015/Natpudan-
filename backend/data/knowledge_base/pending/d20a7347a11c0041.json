It can arise from primary infection, or re-activation of \npreviously latent disease. Transmission of TB is via inhalation of aerosol droplets \ncontaining bacterium. This means only pulmonary disease is communicable.\nLatent TB is infection without disease due to persistent immune system containment \n(ie granuloma formation prevents bacteria growth and spread). Positive skin/blood \ntesting (p394) shows evidence of infection but the patient is asymptomatic and non-\ninfectious (normal sputum/CXR). ~2 billion persons worldwide (~\u2153 of world\u2019s popula-\ntion) are estimated to have latent TB. Lifetime risk of reactivation is 5\u201310%. Risk \nfactors for reactivation: new infection (<2y), HIV, organ transplantation, immunosup-\npression (including corticosteroids), silicosis, illicit drug use, malnutrition, high-risk \nsettings (homeless shelter, prison), low socio-economic status, haemodialysis.\nPresentation\n\ue007TB, or not TB\u2014that is the question.
