UK incidence: \u226510 : 100 000/yr (up \n\u2265200% in last 20yrs). Commonly aff ects younger patients \ue018 early diagnosis is vital. \nShort periods of intense UV exposure is a major cause, particularly in the early years. \nMay occur in pre-existing moles. If smooth, well-demarcated, and regular, it is un-\nlikely to be a melanoma but diagnosis can be tricky. Most melanomas have features \ndescribed by Glasgow 7-point checklist (table 13.8) and ABCDE critera (BOX), but not all. \n\ue007If in doubt, refer.\nTable 13.8 Glasgow 7-point checklist (refer if \u22653 points, or with 1 point if suspicious)\nMajor (2 pts each)\nMinor (1 pt each)\n \u2022 Change in size\n \u2022 In\ufb02 ammation \n \u2022 Crusting or bleeding\n \u2022 Change in shape\n \u2022 Sensory change\n \u2022 Change in colour\n \u2022 Diameter >7mm (\ue007unless growth is in the vertical plane)\nSuper\ufb01 cial spreading melanomas (70%) grow slowly, metastasize later, and have \nbetter prognosis than nodular melanomas (10\u201315%) which invade deeply and me-\ntastasize early. Nodular lesions may be amelanotic in ~5%. Others: acral melanomas \noccur on palms, soles, and subungual areas; lentigo maligna melanoma evolves from \npre-exisiting lentigo maligna. Breslow thickness (depth in mm), tumour stage, and \npresence of ulceration are important prognostic factors. \ue057: urgent excision can be cu-\nrative. Chemotherapy gives a response in 10\u201330% with metastatic disease (OHCS p592). \nIpilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an inhibitory T-cell re-\nceptor, has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.5,6\n2 Squamous cell cancer: Usually presents as an ulcerated lesion, with hard, raised \nedges, in sun-exposed sites. May begin in solar keratoses (see later in topic), or be \nfound on the lips of smokers or in long-standing ulcers (=Marjolin\u2019s ulcer). Metastasis \nto lymph nodes is rare, local destruction may be extensive. \ue057: excision + radiotherapy to \ntreat recurrence/aff ected nodes. See \ufb01 g 13.17. NB: the condition may be confused with \na keratoacanthoma\u2014a fast-growing, benign, self-limiting papule plugged with keratin.\n3 Basal cell carcinoma: (AKA rodent ulcer) Nodular: typically a pearly nodule with rolled \ntelangiectatic edge, on the face or a sun-exposed site. May have a central ulcer. See \n\ufb01 g 13.18. Metastases are very rare. It slowly causes local destruction if left untreated. \nSuper\ufb01 cial: lesions appear as red scaly plaques with a raised smooth edge, often on the \ntrunk or shoulders. Cause: (most frequently) UV exposure. \ue057: excision; cryotherapy; for \nsuper\ufb01 cial BCCS topical \ufb02 urouracil or imiquimod (see as for \u2018Solar keratoses\u2019).\nPre-malignant tumours\n1 Solar (actinic) keratoses appear on sun-exposed skin as crumbly, yellow-white \ncrusts. Malignant change to squamous cell carcinoma may occur after several years. \nTreatment: cryotherapy; 5% \ufb02 uorouracil cream or 5% imiquimod\u2014work by causing: \nerythema \ue003 vesiculation \ue003 erosion \ue003 ulceration \ue003 necrosis \ue003 healing epithelialization, \nleaving healthy skin unharmed. Warn patients of expected in\ufb02 ammatory reaction. See \nBNF for dosing. Alternatively: diclofenac gel (3%, use thinly twice-daily for \u226490d).\n2 Bowen\u2019s disease: Slow-growing red/brown scaly plaque, eg on lower legs.  Histology: \nfull-thickness dysplasia (carcinoma in situ). It infrequently progresses to squamous \ncell cancer. Penile Bowen\u2019s disease is called Queyrat\u2019s erythroplasia. Treatment: cryo-\ntherapy, topical \ufb02 uorouracil (see as for \u2018Solar keratoses\u2019) or photodynamic therapy.\n3 See also Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (p702); Paget\u2019s disease of the breast (p708).\nOthers \u2022Secondary carcinoma: Most common metastases to skin are from breast, \nkidney, or lung. Usually a \ufb01 rm nodule, most often on the scalp. See also acanthosis \nnigricans (p562). \u2022Mycosis fungoides: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually con\ufb01 ned \nto skin. Causes itchy, red plaques (S\u00e9zary syndrome-variant also associated with \nerythroderma). \u2022Leucoplakia: This appears as white patches (which may \ufb01 ssure) on \noral or genital mucosa (where it may itch). Frank carcinomatous change may occur. \n\u2022Leprosy: Suspect in any anaesthetic hypopigmented lesion (p441). \u2022Syphilis: Any \ngenital ulcer is syphilis until proved otherwise. Secondary syphilis: papular rash\u2014in-\ncluding, unusually, on the palms (p412).", "text_length": 4432, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 604/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 603, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.219587", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.220432", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
