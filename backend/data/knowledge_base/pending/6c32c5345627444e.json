Free\nT4 and free T3 are not done in the setting of\nhypothyroidism. If you suspect secondary hypothyr\noidism from panhypopituitarism, then measuring\nTSH along with free T4 is warranted. In sick euthyroid,\nthe thyroid is okay but abnormal lab parameters may\noccur because the patient is medically unwell. Free T3\nwill be low due to decreased conversion of free T4 to\nfree T3\nINTERPRETATION\nTSH\nfT4 fT3\nSubclinical hypothyroidism\n\"\nN\nN\nPrimary hypothyroidism\n\"\n#\n#\nSecondary hypothyroidism\n#\n#\n#\nDIAGNOSTIC ISSUES (CONT\u2019D)\nTSH\nfT4 fT3\nSick euthyroid syndrome\nN/\"/# N/# #\nSecondary or tertiary\nhypothyroidism, nephrotic\nsyndrome, anticonvulsants\n(phenytoin, carbamazepine),\nand some sick euthyroid\nsyndrome\nN\n#\n#\nMANAGEMENT\nMYXEDEMA COMA\nABC, O2, IV.
