These may help your patient to relax, but be careful that you do not touch on \na nerve, eg if job recently lost, marriage recently ended so living alone.\nPresenting problem Ask for the main problems that have led to this consultation. \nSit back and listen. Don\u2019t worry whether the information is in a convenient form \nor not\u2014this is an opportunity for the patient to come out with worries, ideas, and \npreoccupations unsullied by your expectations. After >3\u20135min it is often good to aim \nto have a list of all the problems (each sketched only brie\ufb02 y). Read them back to the \npatient and ask if there are any more. Then ask about:\nHistory of presenting problem For each problem obtain details, both current state \nand history of onset, precipitating factors, and eff ects on life.\nCheck of major psychiatric symptoms Check those that have not yet been cov-\nered: depression\u2014low mood, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), thoughts of \nworthlessness/hopelessness, sleep disturbance with early morning waking, loss of \nweight and appetite. Ask speci\ufb01 cally about suicidal thoughts and plans: \u2018Have you \never been so low that you thought of harming yourself?\u2019, \u2018What thoughts have you \nhad?\u2019 Check for hypomanic and manic features which can be missed in a patient \npresenting as depressed. Hallucinations (\u2018Have you ever heard voices or seen things \nwhen there hasn\u2019t been anyone or anything there?\u2019) and delusions (\u2018Have you ever \nhad any thoughts or beliefs that have struck you afterwards as bizarre?\u2019); anxiety \nand avoidance behaviour (eg avoiding shopping because of anxiety or phobias); ob-\nsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviour, eating disorders, alcohol (see p281 \nfor alcohol screening tests) and other drugs.\nPresent circumstances Housing, \ufb01 nance, work, relationships, friends.\nFamily history Ask about health, personality, and occupation of parents and sib-\nlings, and the family\u2019s medical and psychiatric history.\nBackground history Try to understand the context of the presenting problem.\n  \n\u2022 Biography: Relationships with family and peers as a child; school and work record; \nsexual relationships and current relationships; and family. Previous ways of dealing \nwith stress and whether there have been problems and symptoms similar to the \npresenting ones.\n  \n\u2022 Premorbid personality: Mood, character, hobbies, attitudes, and beliefs.\nPast medical and psychiatric history Establish any past or present co-morbidities.\nMental state examination This is the state now, at the time of interview.\nAppearance: Clothing, glasses, headwear?

Gauge your own responses to \nthe patient. The laughter and grand ideas of manic patients are contagious, as to a \nlesser extent is the expression of thoughts from a depressed person.\nThoughts: Content: eg about himself, his own body, about other people, and the \nfuture, any suicidal ideation? Note abnormal beliefs (delusions), eg that thoughts are \noverheard, and abnormal ideas (eg persecutory, grandiose). Form: \ufb02 ight of ideas? \nKnight\u2019s move thinking? (See BOX \u2018Psychiatric symptoms\u2019.)\nUnusual experiences or hallucinations: Note modality, eg visual, auditory.\nCognition: Orientated in time, place, and person? Short-term memory: give a name \nand address and test recall after 5min. Draw the face of a clock (requires good \nfrontal and parietal function). Long-term memory: current aff airs recall. Name of \ncurrent political leaders (p64). This tests many other CNS functions, not just memory.\nConcentration: Months of the year backwards.\nInsight: Does the patient think they are unwell?
