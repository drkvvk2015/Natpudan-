Intestinal iron absorption (1\u20132mg/day) compensates for daily iron losses.\nRed meats, liver, seafoods, enriched breakfast cereals and pulses, and some \nspices (eg paprika) are iron-rich. Most dietary iron is Fe\n3+, which is reduced by \nlow gastric pH and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to better-absorbed Fe\n2+. Absorption \noccurs mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, though very small amounts are ab-\nsorbed in the stomach and ileum. Iron requirements are greater for women (men-\nstrual loss), when growing, in pregnancy, and in chronic infection.\nHepcidin, a peptide synthesized in hepatocytes, secreted in plasma, is a negative \nregulator of gut iron absorption and haeme iron recycling by macrophages. \nHepcidin synthesis is stimulated by iron and repressed by iron de\ufb01 ciency and by \n\ue000 marrow erythropoiesis (eg in anaemia, bleeding, haemolysis, dyserythropoiesis, or \nerythropoietin injections). Defects in the normal triggering of hepcidin by iron excess \nis a rare cause of haemochromatosis unrelated to HFE mutations, whereas a defect \nin hepcidin repression is responsible for an iron refractory iron de\ufb01 ciency anaemia.\nIn HH, the total body iron is up to 10-fold that of a normal person, with load-\ning found particularly in the liver and pancreas (\u2248100). Hepatic disease classically \nstarts with \ufb01 brosis, progressing to cirrhosis as a late feature.\nA bit about iron metabolism\nFig 6.33 Haemochromatosis causes stressed joints to deteriorate faster than resting joints: the \n2nd and 3rd MCP joints have osteophytes and narrowed joint spaces compared to the normal hand \n(right image) in this man who only used his dominant hand for his production line job.\nReproduced from \u2018Haemochromatosis arthropathy and repetitive trauma\u2019, Annals of the Rheumatic \nDiseases, Morgan et al., 61(8): 763, 2002, with permission from BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.", "text_length": 2102, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 297/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 296, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.683483", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.686078", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
