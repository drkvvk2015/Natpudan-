A prolonged (>\u00bdh), dull, \ncentral crushing pain or pressure suggests MI.\nRadiation: To shoulder, either or both arms, or neck/jaw suggests cardiac ischae-\nmia. The pain of aortic dissection (p654) is classically instantaneous, tearing, and \ninterscapular, but may be retrosternal. Epigastric pain may be cardiac.\nPrecipitants: Pain associated with cold, exercise, palpitations, or emotion suggests \ncardiac pain or anxiety; if brought on by food, lying \ufb02 at, hot drinks, or alcohol, con-\nsider oesophageal spasm/disease (but meals can also cause angina).\nRelieving factors: If pain is relieved within minutes by rest or glyceryl trinitrate \n(GTN), suspect angina (GTN relieves oesophageal spasm more slowly). If antacids help, \nsuspect GI causes. Pericarditic pain improves on leaning forward.\nAssociations: Dyspnoea occurs with cardiac pain, pulmonary emboli, pleurisy, or \nanxiety. MI may cause nausea, vomiting, or sweating. Angina is caused by coronary \nartery disease\u2014and also by aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomy opathy (HCM), \nparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)\u2014and can be exacerbated by anae-\nmia. Chest pain with tenderness suggests self-limiting Tietze\u2019s syndrome. \n1 Odd neu-\nrological symptoms and atypical chest pain\u2014think aortic dissection.\nPleuritic pain: Pain exacerbated by inspiration. Implies in\ufb02 ammation of the pleura \nfrom pulmonary infection, in\ufb02 ammation, or infarction. It causes us to \u2018catch our \nbreath\u2019. \ue059\ue059: musculoskeletal pain;\n1 fractured rib (pain on respiration, exacerbated \nby gentle pressure on the sternum); subdiaphragmatic pathology (eg gallstones).\n\ue022Chest pain & acutely unwell (see p784) \u2022 Admit \u2022 Check pulse, BP in both arms \n(unequal in aortic dissection p654), JVP, heart sounds; examine legs for DVT \u2022 Give O2 \n\u2022 IV line \u2022 Relieve pain (eg 5\u201310mg IV morphine) \u2022 Cardiac monitor \u2022 12-lead ECG \u2022 CXR \n\u2022 Arterial blood gas (ABG) Famous traps: Aortic dissection; zoster (p404); ruptured \noesophagus; cardiac tamponade (p154); opiate addiction.\nDyspnoea May be from LVF, PE, any respiratory cause, anaemia, pain, or anxiety.\nSeverity: \ue022Emergency presentations: p782. Ask about shortness of breath at rest, \non exertion, and on lying \ufb02 at; has their exercise tolerance changed? Associations: \nSpeci\ufb01 c symptoms associated with heart failure are orthopnoea (ask about number \nof pillows used at night), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (waking up at night gasp-\ning for breath, p49), and peripheral oedema. Pulmonary embolism is associated with \nacute onset of dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain; ask about risk factors for DVT.\nPalpitation(s) May be due to ectopics, sinus tachycardia, AF, SVT, VT, thyrotoxicosis, \nanxiety, and rarely phaeochromocytoma. See p36. History: Characterize: do they \nmean their heart was beating fast, hard, or irregularly? Ask about previous episodes, \nprecipitating/relieving factors, duration of symptoms, associated chest pain, dysp-\nnoea, dizziness, or collapse. Did the patient check their pulse?\nSyncope May re\ufb02 ect cardiac or CNS events. Vasovagal \u2018faints\u2019 are common (pulse\ue001, \npupils dilated). The history from an observer is invaluable in diagnosis. Prodromal \nsymptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnoea point to a cardiac cause, eg ar-\nrhythmia. Aura, headache, dysarthria, and limb weakness indicate CNS causes. \nDuring the episode: Was there a pulse? Limb jerking, tongue biting, or urinary incon-\ntinence? NB: hypoxia from lack of cerebral perfusion may cause seizures. Recovery: \nWas this rapid (arrhythmia) or prolonged, with drowsiness (seizure)?\n1 25% of non-cardiac chest pain is musculoskeletal: look for pain on speci\ufb01 c postures or activity. Aim to \nreproduce the pain by movement and, sometimes, palpation over the structure causing it. Focal inj ection of \nlocal anaesthetic helps diagnostically and is therapeutic. Tietze\u2019s syndrome: self-limiting costochond ritis \n\u00b1 costosternal joint swelling. Causes: idiopathic; microtrauma; infection; psor iatic/rheumatoid arthritis. \ue014: \nNSAIDS or steroid injections. Tenderness is also caused by: \ufb01 brositis, lymph oma, chondrosarcoma, myeloma, \nmetastases, rib TB.
