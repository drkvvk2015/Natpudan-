Facial pain \ue031\ue031: p65.\nTrigeminal neuralgia\n\n--- Page 472 ---\n458\nNeurology\nMigraine\n15% of us suff er from migraines, (\ue033:\ue032 \ue056 3:1); the economic costs extend to \u00a3billions/yr.\nSymptoms Classically: \u2022Visual or other aura (see below) lasting 15\u201330min followed \nwithin 1h by unilateral, throbbing headache. Or: \u2022Isolated aura with no headache; \n\u2022Epi sodic severe headaches without aura, often premenstrual, usually unilateral, with \nnausea, vomiting \u00b1 photophobia/phono phobia (\u2018common migraine\u2019). There may be \nallodynia\u2014all stimuli produce pain: \u2018I can\u2019t brush my hair, wear earrings or glasses, \nor shave, it\u2019s so pain ful.\u2019 Prodrome: Precedes headache by hours/days: yawning, crav-\nings, mood/sleep change. Aura: \u2022 Visual: chaotic distorting, \u2018melting\u2019 and jumbling of \nlines, dots, or zigzags, scotomata or hemianopia; \u2022 Somatosensory: paraesthesiae \nspreading from \ufb01 ngers to face; \u2022 Motor: dysarthria and ataxia (basilar migraine), \nophthalmoplegia, or hemiparesis; \u2022 Speech: (8% of auras) dysphasia or paraphasia.\nPartial triggers Seen in 50%: CHOCOLATE or: chocolate, hangovers, orgasms, \ncheese/caff eine, oral contraceptives, lie-ins, alcohol, travel, or exercise.\nAssociations Obesity, family history.\nDiagnosis Clinical, based on the history. Diagnostic criteria if no aura: \u22655 head-\naches lasting 4\u201372h + nausea/vomiting (or photo/phonophobia) + any 2 of: \u2022 Unilateral \n\u2022 Pulsating \u2022 Impairs (or worsened by) routine activity.\nDiff erentials Cluster or tension headache, cervical spondylosis, \ue000BP, intracranial pa-\nthology, sinusitis/otitis media, dental caries. TIAS may mimic migraine aura.\nManagement \ue007Avoid identi\ufb01 ed triggers and ensure analgesic rebound headache \nis not complicating matters (p456). Prophylactic treatment: Can achieve ~50%\ue001 \nin attack frequency in most patients; consider after risks and bene\ufb01 ts discussion. \n1st line: Propranolol 40\u2013120mg/12h or topiramate 25\u201350mg/12h (teratogenic, can in-\nterfere with Pill effi  cacy). Amitriptyline 10\u201375mg nocte can be used, though this is \noff -licence. \ue007Patients may be on previously-recommended prophylactic agents (eg \nvalproate, pizotifen, pregabalin or ACE-i): if achieving good control then continue \nas required. 12-weekly botulinum toxin type A injections are a last resort in chronic \nmigraine.  Treatment during an attack: NICE recommends an oral triptan (or nasal \nin 12\u201317y) combined with either an NSAID or paracetamol.1 Monotherapy with any of \nthe above (or aspirin 900mg) can also be considered. Anti-emetics may help even in \nthe abscence of nausea and vomiting. Triptans are CI if IHD, coronary spasm, uncon-\ntrolled \ue000 BP, recent lithium, SSRIS, or ergot use. Rare SE: arrhythmias or angina \u00b1 MI, \neven if no pre-existing risk. Non-pharmacological therapies: Warm or cold packs to \nthe head, or rebreathing into paper bag (\ue000PaCO2) may help abort attacks. Butterbur \nextracts or ribo\ufb02 avin supplementation may have a role. NICE recommend 10 sessions \nof acupuncture over 5\u20138 weeks if both topiramate and propranolol are unsuitable or \nineff ective. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation may help.\nConsiderations in females Incidence of migraine (especially with aura) + ischae-\nmic stroke is increased by use of a combined OCP. Use progesterone-only or non-\nhormonal contraception in migraine + aura, though a low dose combined OCP can \nbe used in those without aura. Further \ue000risk: \u2022 Smoking \u2022 Age >35yrs \u2022 BP\ue000 \u2022 Obesity \n(body mass index >30) \u2022 Diabetes mellitus \u2022 Hyperlipidaemia \u2022 Family history of arte-\nriopathy <45yrs. \ue007Warn patients to stop OCP at once if they develop aura or worsen-\ning migraine; see OHCS p301. Perimenstrual migraine: If uncontrolled with standard \ntreatment and the onset of headache is predictable then consider frovatriptan \n2.5mg BD or zolmitriptan 2.5mg BD/TDS on the days migraine is expected. Pregnancy: \nMigraine often improves; if not, get help\u2014worsening headaches in pregnancy are \nassociated with a greater risk of pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular complications. \nOff er paracetamol 1st line. Triptans and NSAIDs can be used but discuss risks and \nbene\ufb01 ts with patients \ufb01 rst. Don\u2019t use aspirin if breastfeeding. Anti-emetic: cyclizine \nor promethazine.
