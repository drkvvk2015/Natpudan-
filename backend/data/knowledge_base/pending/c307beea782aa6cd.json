Pigment stones: Small, fri-\nable, and irregular. Causes: haemolysis. Cholesterol stones: Large, often solitary. \nCauses: \ue033, age, obesity (Admirand\u2019s triangle: \ue000risk of stone if \ue001lecithin, \ue001bile salts, \n\ue000cholesterol). Mixed stones: Faceted (calcium salts, pigment, and cholesterol). Gall-\nstone prevalence: 8% of those over 40yrs. 90% remain asymptomatic. Risk factors \nfor stones becoming symptomatic: smoking; parity.\nBiliary colic Gallstones are symptomatic with cystic duct obstruction or if passed \ninto the common bile duct (CBD\n10). RUQ pain (radiates \ue003 back) \u00b1 jaundice. \ue057: Analgesia \n(see p636), rehydrate, NBM. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see BOX \u2018Early or \ndelayed cholecystectomy?\u2019). Do urinalysis, CXR, and ECG.\nAcute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallblad-\nder (GB\n10), which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right \nshoulder\u2014see p609), vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a GB mass. The main dif-\nference from biliary colic is the in\ufb02 ammatory component (local peritonism, fever, \nWCC\ue000; see table 13.16). If the stone moves to the CBD, obstructive jaundice and cholan-\ngitis may occur\u2014see BOX \u2018Complications of gallstones\u2019. Murphy\u2019s sign: lay 2 \ufb01 ngers \nover the RUQ; ask patient to breathe in. This causes pain & arrest of inspiration as \nan in\ufb02 amed GB impinges on your \ufb01 ngers. It is only +ve if the same test in the LUQ \ndoes not cause pain. A phlegmon (RUQ mass of in\ufb02 amed adherent omentum and \nbowel) may be palpable. Tests: \ue000WCC, US\u2014a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in \nchronic disease), peri cholecystic \ufb02 uid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only \nshows ~10% of gallstones; it may identify a \u2018porcelain\u2019 GB (associated risk of cancer). \nTreatment: NBM, pain relief, IVI, and antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg/8h IV. Lapa-\nroscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients \ufb01 t for GA. Open \nsurgery is required if there is GB perforation. If elderly or high risk/unsuit able for \nsurgery, consi der percutaneous cholecystostomy; cholecystectomy can still be done \nlater. Cholecystostomy is also the preferred treatment for acalculous cholecystitis.\nChronic cholecystitis Chronic in\ufb02 ammation \u00b1 colic. \u2018Flatulent dyspepsia\u2019: vague \nabdom inal discomfort, distension, nausea, \ufb02 atulence, and fat intolerance (fat stimu-\nlates cholecystokinin release and GB contraction). US to image stones and assess CBD \ndiameter. MRCP (p742) is used to \ufb01 nd CBD stones. \ue057: Chole cystectomy. If US shows a di-\nlated CBD with stones, ERCP (p742) + sphincterotomy before surgery. If symptoms per-\nsist post-surgery consider hiatus hernia/IBS/peptic ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour.\nOther presentations\n  \n\u2022 Obstructive jaundice with CBD stones: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with \nsphincterotomy \u00b1 biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open sur-\ngery with CBD exploration. If CBD stones are suspected pre-operatively, they should \nbe identi\ufb01 ed by MRCP (p742).\n  \n\u2022 Cholangitis: (Bile duct infection.) Causing RUQ pain, jaundice, and rigors (Charcot\u2019s \ntriad, BOX \u2018Complications of gallstones\u2019). Treat with, eg piperacillin/tazobactam \n4.5g/8h IV.\n  \n\u2022 Gallstone ileus: A stone erodes through the GB into the duodenum; it may then \nobstruct the terminal ileum. AXR shows: air in CBD (= pneumobilia), small bowel \ufb02 uid \nlevels, and a stone. Duodenal obstruction is rarer (Bouveret\u2019s syndrome).\n  \n\u2022 Pancreatitis: See p636.\n  \n\u2022 Mucocoele/empyema: Obstructed GB \ufb01 lls with mucus (secreted by GB wall)/pus.\n  \n\u2022 Silent stones: Do elective surgery on those with sickle cell, immunosuppression, \n(debatably diabetes) as well as all calci\ufb01 ed/porcelain GBS.\n  \n\u2022 Mirizzi\u2019s syndrome: A stone in the GB presses on the bile duct causing jaundice.\n  \n\u2022 Gallbladder necrosis: Rare because of dual blood supply (hepatic artery via cystic \nartery, and from small branches of the hepatic artery in the GB fossa).\n  \n\u2022 Other: Causes of cholecystitis and biliary symptoms other than gallstones are rare. \nConsider infection (typhoid, cryptosporidiosis, and brucellosis); cholecystokinin \nrelease; parenteral nutrition; anatomical abnormality; polyarteritis nodosa (p556).\n10 Common abbreviations used in this section: CBD, common bile duct; GB, gallbladder.", "text_length": 4512, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 642/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 641, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.281521", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.282381", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
