It is a cause of MI in the presence \nof normal arteries. The stress may be medical (SAH, p478) or psychological. \nThink of Conn\u2019s in these contexts:\n  \n\u2022 Hypertension associated with hypokalaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Refractory hypertension, eg despite \u22653 antihypertensive drugs.\n  \n\u2022 Hypertension occurring before 40yrs of age (especially in women). \nThe approach to investigation remains controversial, but the simplest is to look \nfor a suppressed renin and \ue000aldosterone (may be normal if there is severe hy-\npokalaemia). CT or MRI of the adrenals is done to localize the cause. This should \nbe done after hyperaldosteronism is proven, due to the high number of adrenal \nincident alomas. If imaging shows a unilateral adenoma, adrenal vein sampling \nmay be done (venous blood is sampled from both adrenals). If one side reveals \nincreased aldosterone:cortisol ratio compared with the other (>3-fold diff erence), \nan adenoma is likely, and surgical excision is indicated. If no nodules or bilateral \nnodules are seen, think about adrenal hyperplasia or GRA.\n\ue007NB: renal artery stenosis is a more common cause of refractory \ue000BP and \ue001K\n+ (p315).\nHypertension: a common context for hyperaldosteronism tests\nTry to diagnose before death: suspect if BP hard to control, accelerating, or episodic.\n  \n\u2022 Heart: \ue000Pulse; palpit ations/VT; dyspnoea; faints; angina; MI/LVF; cardiomyopathy.\n6\n  \n\u2022 CNS: Headache; visual disorder; dizziness; tremor; numbness; \ufb01 ts; encephalopa-\nthy; Horner\u2019s syndrome (paraganglioma); subarachnoid/CNS haemorrhage.\n  \n\u2022 Psychological: Anxiety; panic; hyperactivity; confusion; episodic psychosis.\n  \n\u2022 Gut: D&V; abdominal pain over tumour site; mass; mesenteric vasoconstriction.\n  \n\u2022 Others: Sweats/\ufb02 ushes; heat intolerance; pallor; \ue000T\u00b0; backache; haemoptysis.\nSymptoms may be precipitated by straining, exercise, stress, abdominal pressure, \nsurgery, or by agents such as \ue020-blockers, IV contrast agents, or the tricyclics. The \nsite of the tumour may determine precipitants, eg if pelvic, precipitants include \nsexual intercourse, parturition, defecation, and micturition. Adrenergic crises may \nlast minutes to days.
