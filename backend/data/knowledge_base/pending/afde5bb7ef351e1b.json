Paraskeva.\n\n--- Page 622 ---\n608\nSurgery\nAcute appendicitis\nIncidence Most common surgical emergency (lifetime incidence = 6%). Can occur \nat any age, though highest incidence is between 10\u201320yrs.\n8 It is rare before age 2 \nbecause the appendix is cone shaped with a larger lumen.\nPathogenesis Gut organisms invade the appendix wall after lumen obstruction by \nlymphoid hyperplasia, faecolith, or \ufb01 larial worms. This leads to oedema, ischaemic \nnecrosis, and perforation.\nPresentation Classically periumbilical pain that moves to the RIF. Associated signs \nmay include tachycardia, fever, peritonism with guarding and rebound or percussion \ntenderness in RIF. Pain on right during PR examination suggests an in\ufb02 ammed, low-\nlying pelvic appendix. Anorexia is an important feature; vomiting is rarely promi-\nnent\u2014pain normally precedes vomiting in the surgical abdomen. Constipation is \nusual, though diarrhoea may occur. Additional signs: Rovsing\u2019s sign (pain > in RIF \nthan LIF when the LIF is pressed). Psoas sign (pain on extending hip if retrocaecal \nappendix). Cope sign (pain on \ufb02 exion and internal rotation of right hip if appendix in \nclose relation to obturator internus).\nInvestigations Blood tests may reveal neutrophil leucocytosis and elevated CRP. US \nmay help, but the appendix is not always visualized. CT has high diagnostic accuracy \nand is useful if diagnosis is unclear: it reduces \u03a9ve appendicectomy rate.\nVariations in the clinical picture\n  \n\u2022 In\ufb02 ammation in a retrocecal/retroperitoneal appendix (2.5%) may cause \ufb02 ank or \nRUQ pain; its only sign may be \ue000tenderness on the right on PR.\n  \n\u2022 The child with vague abdominal pain who will not eat their favourite food.\n  \n\u2022 The shocked, confused octogenarian who is not in pain.\n  \u2022 Appendicitis occurs in ~1/1000 pregnancies. Mortality is higher, especially from \n20wks\u2019 gestation. Perforation is more common, and increases fetal mortality. Pain is \noften less well localized (may be RUQ) and signs of peritonism less obvious.\nHints\n  \n\u2022 If a child is anxious, use their hand to press their tummy.\n  \n\u2022 Check for recent viral illnesses and lymphadenopathy\u2014mesenteric adenitis?\n  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t start palpating in the RIF (makes it diffi  cult to elicit pain elsewhere).\n  \n\u2022 Expect diagnosis to be wrong half the time. If diagnosis is uncertain, re-examine \noften. A normal appendix is removed in up to 20% of patients.\nTreatment Prompt appendicectomy (\ufb01 g 13.27). Antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobac-\ntam 4.5g/8h, 1 to 3 doses IV starting 1h pre-op, reduces wound infections. Give a long-\ner course if perforated. Laparoscopy: Has dia gnostic and therapeutic advantages \n(if surgeon experienced), especially in women and the obese. It is not recommended \nin cases of suspected gangrenous per for ation as the rate of abscess formation may \nbe higher.\nComplications\n  \n\u2022 Perforation is commoner if a faecolith is present and in young children, as the \ndiagnosis is more often delayed.\n  \u2022 Appendix mass may result when an in\ufb02 amed appendix becomes covered with omen-\ntum. US/CT may help with diagnosis. Some advocate early surgery. Alternatively, \ninitial conservative management\u2014NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some \nperform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (lapa-\nrotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th decade.\n  \n\u2022 Appendix abscess May result if an appendix mass fails to resolve but enlarges \nand the patient gets more unwell. Treatment usually involves drainage (surgical or \npercutaneous under US/CT-guidance). Antibiotics alone may bring resolution. \n8 There is a second peak between 60\u201370yrs; older adults may present later with atypical symptoms.", "text_length": 3729, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 616/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 615, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.239182", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.239887", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
