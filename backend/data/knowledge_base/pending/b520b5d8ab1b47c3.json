Major cause = enterotoxigenic E. coli.\nPrevention: Boil water, cook thoroughly, peel fruit and vegetables. Avoid ice, sal-\nads, shell\ufb01 sh. Drink with a straw. Hand washing with soap may \ue001 risk.\nPresentation: Most diarrhoea is during \ufb01 rst week of travel. Symptoms are often \nunreliable indicators of aetiology but the following may be indicative:\n  \n\u2022 Enterotoxigenic E. coli: watery diarrhoea preceded by cramps and nausea.\n  \n\u2022 Giardia lamblia: upper GI symptoms, eg bloating, belching.\n  \n\u2022 Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella: colitic symptoms, urgency, cramps.\nDuration of diarrhoea: most <1wk, 10%>1wk, 5% >2wks, 1%>30d.\nTreatment:\n  \n\u2022 Oral rehydration. Clear \ufb02 uid or oral rehydration salts. \ue007Home-made oral rehy-\ndration recipe: 6 level teaspoons of sugar + half level teaspoon salt in 1L clean, \ndrinking water.\n  \n\u2022 Antimotility agents, eg loperamide, bismuth subsalicylates. Avoid if severe pain \nor bloody diarrhoea as may indicate invasive colitis.\n  \n\u2022 Antibiotics: usually not indicated. Considered if rapid cessation of diarrhoea \nneeded and/or limited access to sanitation/healthcare. Reduce diarrhoea from \n~3 to ~1.5 days. Choice depends on allergy, comorbidity, concomitant medica-\ntion, and destination of travel: cipro\ufb02 oxacin 500mg BD for 3d (care \ue000quinolone \nresistance, eg SE Asia), rifaximin 200mg TDS for 3d, azithromycin 1g single dose \nor 500mg OD for 3d.\nProphylaxis: Not recommended as severe disease and long-term sequelae rare, \nrisk of C. dif\ufb01 cile. Consider in immunosuppressed (transplant, HIV, chemotherapy), \nGI pathology (IBD, ileostomy, short-bowel), \ue000risk with dehydration (sickle cell, CKD). \nCare with interactions with usual medications.\n  \n\u2022 Cipro\ufb02 oxacin 500mg OD (80\u2013100% protection).\n  \n\u2022 Nor\ufb02 oxacin 400mg OD (75\u201395% protection).\n  \n\u2022 Rifaximin 200mg every 12\u201324h (72\u201377% protection).\n  \n\u2022 Bismuth subsalicylate 2 tablets QDS (62\u201365% protection, 1st line in US).\nPersistent diarrhoea: Investigate if >14d or dysentery: FBC, U&E, LFT, in\ufb02 amma-\ntory markers, stool microscopy for ova/cysts/parasites (historically 3 samples but \nmay not actually improve diagnostic yield, time intensive), molecular testing for \n(pre-de\ufb01 ned) microbes. \ue031\ue031 of persistent diarrhoea = Giardia (most common diag-\nnosis, send PCR), Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella. Post-infectious irritable bowel \nsyndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion (in up to 30%).\n\ue007Do not forget: malaria, HIV.\nTraveller\u2019s diarrhoea", "text_length": 3250, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 437/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 436, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.925723", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.926754", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
