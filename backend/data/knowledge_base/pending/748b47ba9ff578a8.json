DRUG-ELUTING STENTS\nin\nstent restenosis is due to fibrosis of coronary\nvasculature and usually happens 3 months post\nprocedure. Drug eluting stents (sirolimus or pacli\ntaxel) are designed to inhibit cell proliferation\nand decrease the risk of in stent restenosis.\nThere has been some controversy regarding\nhigher observed mortality rate in patients with\ndrug eluting stents. The most recent outcomes\nresearch analysis suggests that drug eluting\nstents are associated with decreased rate of\nrepeat revascularization (19% vs. 23%, HR 0.82)\nat 2 years and no significant difference in mortal\nity (8.4% vs. 8.4%)\n\u0002\nBENEFITS\nprimary PCI is generally preferred\ngiven the superior outcomes compared to fibri\nnolysis, particularly if (1) fibrinolysis contraindi\ncated, (2) previous history of CABG, or (3) cardio\ngenic shock. However, patients who were able to\nseek medical attention within 1 h of chest pain\nonset, allergic to contrast dye, or do not have\naccess to PCI in a timely fashion should consider\nfibrinolytics\nTREATMENT ISSUES (CONT\u2019D)\nOUTCOMES FOR FIBRINOLYTICS VS.
