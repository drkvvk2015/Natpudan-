Although pancreatitis is mild in 80% of cases; 20% develop \nsevere complicated and life-threatening disease: progression may be rapid from mild \noedema to necrotizing pancreatitis. ~50% of cases that advance to necrosis are fur-\nther complicated by infection.\nCauses The one mnemonic we can all agree on: \u2018GET SMASHED\u2018. Gallstones (~35%), \nEthanol (~35%), Trauma (~1.5%), Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune (PAN), Scorpion \nvenom, Hyperlipidaemia, hypothermia, hypercalcaemia, ERCP (~5%) and emboli, \nDrugs. Also pregnancy and neoplasia or no cause found (~10\u201330%).\nSymptoms Gradual or sudden severe epigastric or central abdominal pain (radiates \nto back, sitting forward may relieve); vomiting prominent.\nSigns \ue007May be subtle in serious disease. \ue000HR, fever, jaundice, shock, ileus, rigid abdo-\nmen \u00b1 local/general tenderness, periumbilical bruising (Cullen\u2019s sign) or \ufb02 anks (Grey \nTurner\u2019s sign) from blood vessel autodigestion and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.\nTests Raised serum amylase (>1000U/mL or around 3-fold upper limit of normal). The \ndegree of elevation is not related to severity of disease. \ue007Amylase may be normal \neven in severe pancreatitis (levels starts to fall within 24\u201348h). It is excreted renally \nso renal failure will \ue000 levels. Cholecystitis, mesenteric infarction, and GI perforation \ncan cause lesser rises. Serum lipase is more sensitive and speci\ufb01 c for pancreat itis \n(especially when related to alcohol), and rises earlier and falls later. ABG to monitor \noxy genation and acid\u2013base status. AXR: No psoas shadow (\ue000retroperitoneal \ufb02 uid), \n\u2018sentinel loop\u2019 of proximal jejunum from ileus (solitary air-\ufb01 lled dilatation). Erect CXR \nhelps exclude other causes (eg perforation). CT is the standard choice of imaging to \nassess severity and for complications. US (if gallstones + \ue000AST). ERCP if LFTS worsen. CRP \n>150mg/L at 36h after admission is a predictor of severe pancreatitis.\nManagement Severity assessment is essential (see BOX and table 13.17).\n  \n\u2022 Nil by mouth, consider NJ feeding (decrease pancreatic stimulation). Set up IVI \nand give lots of crystalloid, to counter third-space sequestration, un til vital signs \nare satisfactory and urine \ufb02 ow stays at >30mL/h. Insert a urinary catheter and \nconsider CVP monitoring.\n  \n\u2022 Analgesia: pethidine 75\u2013100mg/4h IM, or morphine (may cause Oddi\u2019s sphincter \nto contract more, but it is a better analgesic and not contraindicated).\n  \n\u2022 Hourly pulse, BP, and urine output; daily FBC, U&E, Ca\n2+, glucose, amylase, ABG.\n  \n\u2022 If worsening: ITU, O2 if \ue001PaO2. In suspected abscess formation or pancreatic ne-\ncrosis (on CT), consider parenteral nutrition \u00b1 laparotomy & debridement (\u2018necro-\nsectomy\u2019). Antibiotics may help in severe disease.\n  \n\u2022 ERCP + gallstone removal may be needed if there is progressive jaundice.\n  \n\u2022 Repeat imaging (usually CT) is performed in order to monitor progress.\n\ue031\ue031 Any acute abdomen (p606), myocardial infarct.\nEarly complications Shock, ARDS (p186), renal failure (\ue007give lots of \ufb02 uid!), DIC, sep-\nsis, \ue001Ca\n2+, \ue000glucose (transient; 5% need insulin).\nLate complications (>1wk.) Pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst (\ufb02 uid in lesser \nsac, \ufb01 g 13.45), with fever, a mass \u00b1 persistent \ue000amylase/LFT; may resolve or need \ndrainage. Abscesses need draining. Bleeding from elastase eroding a major ves-\nsel (eg splenic artery); embolization may be life-saving. Thrombosis may occur in \nthe splenic/gastro duodenal arteries, or colic branches of the SMA, causing bowel \nnecrosis. Fistulae normally close spontaneously. If purely pancreatic they do not \nirritate the skin. Some patients suff er recurrent oedematous pancreatitis so often \nthat near-total pancreat ectomy is contemplated. \ue007It can all be a miserable course.", "text_length": 4095, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 644/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 643, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.284146", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.285604", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
