Subsequently completion proctectomy (permanent stoma) vs ileo\u2013anal \npouch. Pouches mean stoma reversal and the possibility of long-term continence but \npouch opening frequency may still be around 6\u2248/day and recurrent pouchitis can be \ntroublesome (give anti biotics, eg metronidazole + cipro\ufb02 oxacin for 2wks).\nAfter full investigation, IBD may not obviously be Crohn\u2019s or UC. IBD-U refers \nto isolated colonic IBD where the diagnosis remains unknown (small bowel \ninvolvement=Crohn\u2019s). This situation is rare in adults but commoner in children. \nOver time the phenotype tends to become clearer (generally UC>Crohn\u2019s).
