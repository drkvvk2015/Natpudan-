Acid re\ufb02 ux often happens as the lower oesophageal sphincter \nbecomes less competent in many cases.\nParaoesophageal hernia (rolling hiatus hernia) (20%) The gastro-oesophageal \njunction remains in the abdomen but a bulge of stomach herniates up into the \nchest alongside the oesophagus\u2014see \ufb01 gs 6.18, 6.19. As the gastro-oesophageal \njunction remains intact, GORD is less common.\nClinical features Common: 30% of patients >50yrs, especially obese women. Al-\nthough most small hernias are asymptomatic, patients with large hernias may \ndevelop GORD.\nImaging Upper GI endoscopy vis ualizes the mucosa (?oesophagitis) but cannot \nreliably exclude a hiatus hernia.\nTreatment Lose weight. Treat GORD. Surgery indications: intractable symptoms \ndespite aggressive medical therapy, complications (see p254). Although paraoe-\nsophageal hernias may strangulate the risk of this drops dramatically after 65 \nyrs. Prophylactic repair is only undertaken in those considered at high risk, due to \noperative mortality (\u22481\u20132%).\nHiatus hernia\nFig 6.18 Hiatus hernia\u2014sliding and rolling. \nFig 6.19 CT chest (IV contrast) showing the roll-\ning components of a hiatus hernia ant erior to the \noesophagus.
