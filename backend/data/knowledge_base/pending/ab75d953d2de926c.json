Choice depends on\nprior adjuvant chemotherapy, disease free interval,\npatient\u2019s performance status, and willingness/ability to\ntolerate side effects. Doublet regimens are associated\nwith higher response rate and modest gains in overall\nsurvival but more toxicities. Single agents are tolerated\nbetter with limited alopecia and are particularly appro\npriate for patients who are elderly or have poor perfor\nmance status.
