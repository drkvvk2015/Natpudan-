TURP (p642) & other pelvic surgery may weaken the bladder sphinc-\nter and cause incontinence. Troublesome incontinence needs specialist assessment.\nIncontinence in women Often under-reported with delays before seeking help.\n  \n\u2022 Functional incontinence: Ie when physiological factors are relatively unimportant. \nThe patient is \u2018caught short\u2019 and too slow in \ufb01 nding the toilet because of (for exam-\nple) immobility, or unfamiliar surroundings.\n  \n\u2022 Stress incontinence: Leakage from an incompetent sphincter, eg when intra-\nabdominal pressure rises (eg coughing, laughing). Increasing age and obesity are \nrisk factors. The key to diagnosis is the loss of small (but often frequent) amounts \nof urine when coughing etc. Examine for pelvic \ufb02 oor weakness/prolapse/pelvic \nmasses. Look for cough leak on standing and with full bladder. Stress incontinence \nis common in pregnancy and following birth. It occurs to some degree in ~50% of \npost-menopausal women. In elderly women, pelvic \ufb02 oor weakness, eg with uterine \nprolapse or urethrocele (OHCS p290), is a very common association.\n  \n\u2022 Urge incontinence/overactive bladder syndrome: The urge to urinate is quickly \nfollowed by uncon t rollable and sometimes complete emptying of the bladder as \nthe detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home \n(latchkey incontinence, a conditioned re\ufb02 ex); cold; the sound of running water; caf-\nfeine; and obesity. \ue059 : urodynamic studies. Cause: detrusor overactivity (see table \n13.20), eg from central inhibitory pathway malfunction or sensitization of peripher-\nal aff erent terminals in the bladder; or a bladder muscle problem. Check for organic \nbrain damage (eg stroke; Parkinson\u2019s; dementia). Other causes: urinary infection; \ndiabetes; diuretics; atrophic vaginitis; urethritis.\nIn both sexes incontinence may result from confusion or sedation. Occasionally it \nmay be purposeful (eg preventing admission to an old people\u2019s home) or due to anger.\nManagement \ue007Eff ective treatment can have a huge impact on quality of life.\nCheck for: UTI; DM; diuretic use; faecal impaction; palpable bladder; GFR.\n  \n\u2022 Stress incontinence: Pelvic \ufb02 oor exercises are 1st line (8 contractions \u22483/d for \n3 months). Intravaginal electrical stimulation may also be eff ective, but is not \nacceptable to many women. A ring pessary may help uterine prolapse, eg while \nawaiting surgical repair. Surgical options (eg tension-free vaginal tape) aim to sta-\nbilize the mid-urethra. Urethral bulking also available. Medical options: duloxetine \n40mg/12h PO (50% have \u226550% \ue001 in incontinence episodes). SE = nausea. \n  \n\u2022 Urge incontinence: The patient (or carer) should complete an \u2018incontinence\u2019 chart \nfor 3d to de\ufb01 ne the pattern of incontinence. Examine for spinal cord and CNS signs \n(including cognitive test, p64); and for vaginitis (if postmenopausal). Vaginitis can \nbe treated with topical oestrogen therapy for a limited period. Bladder training \n(may include pelvic \ufb02 oor exercises) and weight loss are important. Drugs may help \nreduce night-time incontinence (see BOX) but can be disappointing. Consider aids, \neg absorbent pad. If \ue032 consider a condom catheter.\n\ue007Do urodynamic assessment (cystometry & urine \ufb02 ow rate measurement) before \nany surgical intervention to exclude detrusor overactivity or sphincter dyssynergia.", "text_length": 3888, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 656/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 655, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.301511", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.303112", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
