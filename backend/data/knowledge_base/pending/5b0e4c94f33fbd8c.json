Look for abnormal contours/\ndistension. Tattoos? Cushingoid appearance may suggest steroid use post-trans-\nplant or IBD. Inspect (and smell) for signs of chronic liver disease:\n  \n\u2022 Hepatic fetor on breath (p274).\n  \n\u2022 Gynaecomastia.\n  \n\u2022 Clubbing (rare).\n  \u2022 Purpura (purple-stained skin, p344).\n  \n\u2022 Scratch marks.\n  \n\u2022 Muscle wasting.\n  \n\u2022 Spider naevi (\ufb01 g 2.27, p60).\n  \n\u2022 Palmar erythema.\n  \n\u2022 Jaundice.\n  \n\u2022 Asterixis.\nLook for signs of malignancy (cachexia, masses), anaemia, jaundice, Virchow\u2019s node. \nFrom the end of the bed inspect the abdomen for:\n  \n\u2022 Visible pulsation (aneurysm, p654).\n  \n\u2022 Peristalsis.\n  \n\u2022 Scars.\n  \n\u2022 Masses.\n  \n\u2022 Striae (stretch marks, eg pregnancy).\n  \n\u2022 Distension.\n  \n\u2022 Genitalia.\n  \n\u2022 Herniae.\nIf abdominal wall veins look dilated, assess direction of \ufb02 ow. In inferior vena caval \n(IVC) obstruction, below the umbilicus blood \ufb02 ows up; in portal hypertension (caput \nmedusae), \ufb02 ow radiates out from the umbilicus.\nThe cough test: While looking at the face, ask the patient to cough. If this causes \nabdominal pain, \ufb02 inching, or a protective movement of hands towards the abdomen, \nsuspect peritonitis.\nHands\nClubbing, leuconychia (whitening of the nails due to hypoalbuminaemia), koilo-\nnychia (\u2018spooning\u2019 of the nails due to iron, B12, or folate de\ufb01 ciency), Muehrcke\u2019s lines \n(transverse white lines due to hypoalbuminaemia), blue lunulae (bluish discoloura-\ntion seen in Wilson\u2019s disease). Palmar erythema (chronic liver disease, pregnancy), \nDupuytren\u2019s contracture (thickening and \ufb01 brous contraction of palmar fascia (see \n\ufb01 g 2.26, p60; alcoholic liver disease)). Hepatic \ufb02 ap/asterixis (hepatic encephalopa-\nthy, uraemia from renal disease), check pulse and respiratory rate (infection/sepsis?), \npalpate for AV \ufb01 stulae in the forearm (haemodialysis access in renal failure).\nFace\nAssess for jaundice, anaemia, xanthelasma (PBC, chronic obstruction), Kayser\u2013Fleis-\ncher rings (green-yellow ring at corneal margin seen in Wilson\u2019s disease). Inspect \nmouth for angular stomatitis (thiamine, B12, iron de\ufb01 ciency), pigmentation (Peutz\u2013\nJeghers syndrome, p709, \ufb01 g 15.14), telangiectasia (Osler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu syndrome/\nhereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, p709, \ufb01 g 15.12), ulcers (IBD), glossitis (iron, \nB12, or folate de\ufb01 ciency).\nCervical lymph nodes\nPalpate for enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow\u2019s node/Troisier\u2019s \nsign) (gastric carcinoma?).\nAbdomen\nInspect: Look around to the \ufb02 anks for nephrectomy scars.\nPalpate: Note any masses, tenderness, guarding (involuntary tensing of abdominal \nmuscles\u2014pain or fear of it), or rebound tenderness (greater pain on removing hand \nthan on gently depressing abdomen\u2014peritoneal in\ufb02 ammation); Rovsing\u2019s sign (ap-\npendicitis, p608); Murphy\u2019s sign (cholecystitis, p634). Palpating the liver: Assess size \n(see BOX \u2018Causes of hepatomegaly\u2019), regularity, smoothness, and tenderness. Pulsa-\ntile (tricuspid regurgitation)? The scratch test is another way to \ufb01 nd the lower liver \nedge (if it is below the costal margin): start with diaphragm of stethoscope at right \ncostal margin. Gently scratch the abdominal wall, starting in the right lower quad-\nrant, working towards the liver edge. A sharp increase in trans mission of the scratch \nis heard when the border of the liver is reached. Palpating the spleen: If suspect \nsplenomegaly but cannot detect it, assess patient in the right lateral position with \nyour left hand pulling forwards from behind the rib cage. Palpating the kidneys: \nSee \ufb01 g 2.30, p61. May be non palpable unless slim. Enlarged? Nodular? Palpating the \naorta: Normally palpable transmitted pulsation in thin individuals.", "text_length": 3850, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 74/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 73, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.990654", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.991578", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
