On inversion, the whoosh of water produced an intriguing hammer-\nblow as it rushed from end to end. This is the alternative name for Corrigan\u2019s \ncollapsing pulse\u2014ie one in which the upstroke is abrupt and steep, whose peak \nis reached early and with abnormal force\u2014before a rapid downstroke (as blood \nwhooshes back into the left ventricle through an incompetent aortic valve).\nWaterhammer pulse\nPulses\n\ue007Assess the radial pulse to determine rate and rhythm. Character and volume are \nbest assessed at the brachial or carotid arteries. A collapsing pulse may also be felt \nat the radial artery when the patient\u2019s arm is elevated above their head. See \ufb01 g 2.10.\nRate Is the pulse fast (\ue006100bpm, p126) or slow (\ue00560bpm, p124)?\nRhythm An irregularly irregular pulse occurs in AF or multiple ectopics. A regularly \nirregular pulse occurs in 2\u00b0 heart block and ventricular bigeminus.\nCharacter and volume\n  \n\u2022 Bounding pulses are caused by CO2 retention, liver failure, and sepsis.\n  \n\u2022 Small volume pulses occur in aortic stenosis, shock, and pericardial eff usion.\n  \n\u2022 Collapsing (\u2018waterhammer\u2019) pulses are caused by aortic incompetence, AV mal-\nformations, and a patent ductus arteriosus.\n  \n\u2022 Anacrotic (slow-rising) pulses occur in aortic stenosis.\n  \n\u2022 Bisferiens pulses occur in combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation.\n  \n\u2022 Pulsus alternans (alternating strong and weak beats) suggests LVF, cardio-\nmyopathy, or aortic stenosis.\n  \n\u2022 Jerky pulses occur in H(O)CM.\n  \n\u2022 Pulsus paradoxus (systolic pressure weakens in inspiration by >10mmHg) occurs \nin severe asthma, pericardial constriction, or cardiac tamponade.\nPeripheral pulses (See p36.) See p771 for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling.\nFig 2.10 Arterial pulse waveforms.\nReproduced from Thomas J, et al. (eds).
