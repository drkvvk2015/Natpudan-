More tolerant for mis\nmatches in allogeneic transplant)\nCOMMON INDICATIONS\nDECIDING BETWEEN ALLOGENEIC AND AUTOLO\nGOUS STEM CELL SOURCE\ndependent on age,\nunderlying disease, donor availability, institutional pre\nference. In general, allogeneic transplant is more suita\nble for younger, healthier adults as it is more toxic but\npotentially more effective than autologous transplant\nALLOGENEIC\nacute leukemia (50 70% cure if first\nremission, 10 30% cure if relapse), myelodysplastic\nsyndrome (40 50% cure rate), chronic myeloid leu\nkemia (50 70% cure if chronic phase, 10 30% cure if\nblast phase), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent\nlymphoma, severe immunodeficiency syndromes,\nhemoglobinopathies\nAUTOLOGOUS\nprogressive Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\n(60 70% cure if relapse, 40 50% cure if refractory\ndisease), multiple myeloma, progressive large cell\nlymphoma, relapsed germ cell cancer\nALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION\nHUMAN LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN MOLECULES\nresponsible for displaying endogenous and exo\ngenous peptides to T cells. Mismatch between\nhost and donor HLA type could result in graft vs.\nhost disease, graft failure, or death. Note that trans\nplant is not affected by differences in ABO blood\ngroups\n\u0002 HLA CLASS I\nHLA A, HLA B, HLA C\n\u0002 HLA CLASS II\nHLA DR, HLA DQ, HLA DP\nMATCHING PROCESS\nneed to ensure good match\nof the following loci: HLA A, HLA B, HLA C, DRB1, and\nDQB1. The chance of finding a sibling match is\n1 0.75n, where n=number of siblings. The chance of\nfinding a matched unrelated donor is >60%, higher\nfor Caucasians and lower for other races. Search for a\nmatch typically takes 3 4 months\nCONDITIONING\ngoal is to eradicate malignancy\nand suppress recipient\u2019s immune system to minimize\nrejection of donor\u2019s stem cells. Myeloablative regi\nmens include cyclophosphamide plus total body irra\ndiation (TBI) or high dose busulfan. Reduced intensity\nregimens include fludarabine plus busulfan. Reduced\nintensity (also known as non myeloablative or \u2018\u2018mini\u2019\u2019\ntransplant) regimens use a milder conditioning regi\nmen\nmore\ntolerable\nfor\nolder\npatients\n(e.g.\nALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION (CONT\u2019D)\nfludarabine\nplus\ncyclophosphamide,\nmelphalan).\nMonitor toxicities closely during this time\n\u0002\nHEMATOLOGIC\npancytopenia, febrile neutropenia\n\u0002\nEARLY NON-HEMATOLOGIC\nalopecia, N&V, orophar\nyngeal mucositis, diarrhea, sinusoidal obstruction\nsyndrome (previously known as hepatic veno\nocclusive disease with tender hepatomegaly, jaun\ndicem and ascites), seizures, parotitis, pericarditis,\ncardiomyopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, hemor\nrhagic cystitis, rash\n\u0002\nLATE NON-HEMATOLOGIC\nhypothyroidism, sterility or\npremature menopause, growth impairment, dry\neyes or mouth, cataracts, osteopenia, or osteoporosis\n\u0002\nFERTILITY\ninfertility is almost certain in both men\nand women after TBI regimens, but not definite\nwith non TBI regimens\n\u0002\nSECOND MALIGNANCIES\nincreased incidence of solid\ntumors (bone, oropharynx, connective tissue, CNS,\nthyroid, melanoma), myelodysplastic syndrome,\nacute myelogenous leukemia, and lymphoprolifera\ntive disorders. Highest risks in patients with TBI\nTRANSPLANTATION\ninfusion of stem cells over\n30 min to 2 h\nENGRAFTMENT\ntypically happens between days\n+10 and +20. Defined as ANC >0.5\u0003103/mL, with\nplatelet and RBC engraftment following. GCSF may\nbe used in non leukemic patients to accelerate\nengraftment by up to 1 week. Patient is supported\nwith blood products and antimicrobial prophylaxis\n(e.g. ciprofloxacin for Gram negatives, trimethoprim\nsulfamethoxazole for PCP, acyclovir for HSV, flucona\nzole for fungal agents) until engraftment occurs. Fail\nure to engraft (primary graft failure) and irreversible\ndecline of blood counts (secondary graft failure) are\nserious complications ( <5%). For non myeloablative\ntransplant, perform chimerism analysis and consider\neither donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) or reducing\nimmunosuppression to improve disease control\nIMMUNORECONSTITUTION\nrestoration of T cell\nand B cell immunity takes up to 12 months. Immu\nnosuppressive treatment can usually be stopped\nwithin 1 3 years post allogeneic transplant. Graft vs.\nhost disease (GVHD) is a donor T cell mediated pro\ncess. Overall transplant related mortality is approxi\nmately 20 25%\nGRAFT VS. HOST DISEASE\n\u0002\nACUTE GVHD ( <100 days)\noccurs in 40% of\nmatched sibling and 80% of unrelated donor trans\nplant. Symptoms include rash, hepatic dysfunction,\ndiarrhea, vomiting. Mortality up to 80% in grade III\nand IV acute GVHD. Prophylaxis consisting of meth\notrexate and cyclosporine is usually used for anyone\nother than identical twins. Treatments include cor\nticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil,\ntacrolimus, and antithymocyte globulin\nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n181", "text_length": 5173, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 192/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 191, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.509903", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.510802", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
