Be sure to inspect the pressure points, ie between the \ntoes and under the heel.\n2   Palpation: Skin temperature will be cool in peripheral arterial disease. Is there \na level above which it is warm? Delayed capillary re\ufb01 ll (>2s) also indicates arte-\nrial disease. Are peripheral pulses palpable or not? \u2018If you cannot count it, you \nare not feeling it.\u2019 Note down on a quick stick-man diagram where they become \npalpable. Check for atrial \ufb01 brillation or other arrhythmias, as these can be the \ncause of embolic disease. Palpate for an enlarged abdominal aorta and attempt \nto assess size. (Though don\u2019t press too \ufb01 rmly!) \ue022An expansile pulsatile mass \nin the presence of abdominal symptoms is a ruptured aneurysm until proven \notherwise.\n3   Auscultation: The presence of bruits suggests arterial disease. Listen over the \nmajor arteries\u2014carotids, abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac femorals.\n4   Special tests: Buerger\u2019s angle is that above the horizontal plane which leads to \ndevelopment of pallor (<20\u00b0 indicates severe ischaemia). Buerger\u2019s sign is the \nsequential change in colour from white to pink, upon return to the dependent \nposition; if the limbs become \ufb02 ushed red (reactive hyperaemia) this is indicative \nof more severe disease.\n5   Complete your examination: measure ABPI (p656), US Doppler assessment, and \na neurological examination of the lower limbs.\nVenous\n(See also p658.)\n1   Inspection: Look for any varicosities and decide whether they are the long sa-\nphenous vein (medial), short saphenous vein (posterior lateral, below the knee), \nor from the calf perforators (usually few varicosities but commonly show skin \nchanges). Ulcers around the medial malleolus are more suggestive of venous \ndisease, whereas those at the pressure points suggest arterial pathology. Brown \nhaemosiderin deposits result from venous hypertension. There may also be atro-\nphy and loss of skin elasticity (lipodermatosclerosis) in venous disease.\n2   Palpation: Warm varicose veins may indicate infection. Are they tender? Firm, \ntender varicosities suggests thrombosis. Palpate the saphenofemoral junction \n(SFJ) for a saphena varix which displays a cough impulse. Similarly, incompetence \nat the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) may be felt as a cough impulse. If ulcera-\ntion is present, it is prudent to palpate the arterial pulses to rule out arterial \ndisease.\n3   Tap test: A transmitted percussion impulse from the lower limit of the varicose \nvein to the saphenofemoral junction demonstrates incompetence of super\ufb01 cial \nvalves.\n4   Auscultation: Bruits over the varicosities means there is an arteriovenous mal-\nformation.\n5   Doppler: Test for the level of re\ufb02 ux. On squeezing the leg distal to placement of \nthe probe you should only hear one \u2018whoosh\u2019 if the valves are competent at the \nlevel of probe placement.\n6  Trendelenburg\u2019s test assesses if the SFJ valve is competent. Doppler USS has largely \nconsigned this and other examination methods (eg Tourniquet and Perthes\u2019 \ntest) to the history books.\n7   Complete examination: examine the abdomen, pelvis in females, and external \ngenitalia in males (for masses).", "text_length": 3643, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 90/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 89, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.015526", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.016163", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
