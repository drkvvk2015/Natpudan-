Complications/associations: UTIs, nephrolithiasis, haematuria and hyper-\ncalciuria, hyperparathyroidism (if present, look for genetic markers of MEN type 2A, see p223).\nWhat is its composition?

Is there dehydration?\n  \n\u2022 Medications: precipitating drugs include: diuretics, antacids, acetazolamide, \ncorticosteroids, theophylline, aspirin, allopurinol, vitamin C and D, indinavir.\nAre there any predisposing factors? For example:\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent UTIS (in magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi).\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic abnormalities:\n  \n\u2022 Hypercalciuria/hypercalcaemia (p676): hyperparathyroidism, neoplasia, \nsarc oid osis, hyperthyroidism, Addison\u2019s, Cushing\u2019s, lithium, vitamin D excess.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperuricosuria/\ue000plasma urate: on its own, or with gout.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperoxaluria.\n  \n\u2022 Cystinuria (p321).\n  \n\u2022 Renal tubular acidosis (pp316\u20137).\n  \n\u2022 Urinary tract abnormalities: eg pelviureteric junction obstruction, hydro-\nnephrosis (renal pelvis or calyces), calyceal diverticulum, horseshoe kidney, \nureterocele, vesicoureteric re\ufb02 ux, ureteral stricture, medullary sponge kidney.\n11\n  \n\u2022 Foreign bodies: eg stents, catheters.\nIs there a family history? \ue000Risk of stones 3-fold. Speci\ufb01 c diseases include X-linked \nnephrolithiasis and Dent\u2019s disease (proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis).\n\ue007Is there infection above the stone?
