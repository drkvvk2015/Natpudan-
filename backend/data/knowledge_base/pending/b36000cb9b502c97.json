Thank patient and wash hands.\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n86\nHistory and examination\nSpeech and higher mental function\n\ue007Have mercy on those with dysphasia: it is one of the most debilitating neurological \nconditions, and the more frustrating when cognitive function is intact.\nDysphasia Impairment of language caused by brain damage.\nAssessment:\n1   If speech is \ufb02 uent, grammatical, and meaningful, dysphasia is unlikely.\n2   Comprehension: can the patient follow one-, two-, and several-step commands \n(touch your ear, stand up, then close the door)?\n3   Repetition: can the patient repeat a sentence? Eg British Constitution.\n4   Naming: can they name common and uncommon things (eg parts of a watch)?\n5   Reading and writing: normal? They are usually aff ected like speech in dysphasia. \nIf normal, the patient is unlikely to be aphasic\u2014could they be mute?\nClassi\ufb01 cation:\n  \n\u2022 Broca\u2019s (expressive) anterior dysphasia\u2014non-\ufb02 uent speech produced with ef-\nfort and frustration with malformed words, eg \u2018spoot\u2019 for \u2018spoon\u2019 (or \u2018that thing\u2019). \nReading and writing are impaired but comprehension is relatively intact. Patients \nunderstand questions and attempt to convey meaningful answers. Site of lesion: in-\nfero-lateral dominant frontal lobe (see BOX \u2018Problems with classifying dysphasias\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 Wernicke\u2019s (receptive) posterior dysphasia\u2014empty, \ufb02 uent speech, like talk-\ning ragtime with phonemic (\u2018\ufb02 ush\u2019 for \u2018brush\u2019) and semantic (\u2018comb\u2019 for \u2018brush\u2019) \nparaphasias/neologisms (may be mistaken for psychotic speech). The patient is \noblivious of errors. Reading, writing, and comprehension are impaired (replies are \ninappropriate). Site of lesion: posterior superior dominant temporal lobe.\n  \n\u2022 Conduction aphasia\u2014(traffi  c between Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s area is interrupt-\ned.) Repetition is impaired; comprehension and \ufb02 uency less so.\n  \n\u2022 Nominal dysphasia\u2014naming is aff ected in all dysphasias, but in nominal dyspha-\nsia, objects cannot be named but other aspects of speech are normal. This occurs \nwith posterior dominant temporoparietal lesions.\n\ue007Mixed dysphasias are common. Discriminating features take time to emerge after \nan acute brain injury. Speech therapy is important, but may not help.\nDysarthria Diffi  culty with articulation due to incoordination or weakness of the \nmusculature of speech. Language is normal (see earlier in topic).\n  \n\u2022 Assessment: Ask to repeat \u2018British Constitution\u2019 or \u2018baby hippopotamus\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 Cerebellar disease: Ataxia speech muscles cause slurring (as if drunk) and speech \nirregular in volume and staccato in quality.\n  \n\u2022 Extrapyramidal disease: Soft, indistinct, and monotonous speech.\n  \n\u2022 Pseudobulbar palsy: (p507) Spastic dysarthria (upper motor neuron). Speech is \nslow, indistinct, nasal and eff ortful (\u2018hot potato\u2019 voice from bilateral hemispheric \nlesions, MND (p506), or severe MS).\n  \n\u2022 Bulbar palsy: Lower motor neuron (eg facial nerve palsy, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9, MND, \np506)\u2014any associated palatal paralysis gives speech a nasal character.\nDysphonia Diffi  culty with speech volume due to weakness of respiratory muscles \nor vocal cords (myasthenia, p512; Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, p702). It may be precipi-\ntated in myasthenia by asking the patient to count to 100. Parkinson\u2019s gives a mixed \npicture of dysarthria and dysphonia.\nDyspraxia Poor performance of complex movements despite ability to do each in-\ndividual component. Test by asking the patient to copy unfamiliar hand positions, or \nmime an object\u2019s use, eg a comb. The term \u2018dyspraxia\u2019 is used in three other ways:\n  \n\u2022 Dressing dyspraxia: The patient is unsure of the orientation of clothes on his body. \nTest by pulling one sleeve of a sweater inside out before asking the patient to put it \nback on (mostly non-dominant hemisphere lesions).\n  \n\u2022 Constructional dyspraxia: Diffi  culty in assembling objects or drawing, eg a \ufb01 ve-\npointed star (non-dominant hemisphere lesions, hepatic encephalopathy).\n  \n\u2022 Gait dyspraxia: More common in the elderly; seen with bilateral frontal lesions, \nlesions in the posterior temporal region, and hydrocephalus.", "text_length": 4092, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 98/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 97, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.029328", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.030011", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
