Adherence support should be integral to ART provision.\nAssess: Ask about adherence in a non-judgemental way. Do not blame. Explain the \nreasoning behind your questions. Is non-adherence due to practical problems or \nhealthcare beliefs? Be ready to address both. What help would your patient like?\nIntervene: Normalize the situation\u2014doubts and concerns about ART are common. \nFind time for discussion/information. Address concerns. Simplify the dosage regi-\nmen, off er a multicompartment medication system. Link the taking of medication \nto a regular daily activity. Discuss side-eff ects: what are the risks/bene\ufb01 ts to \nchanging dose or ART regimen? \nAdherence\n\ue007Use local guidelines. \ue007Get expert help.\nFor a treatment-naive patient consider two nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-\nhibitors (=\u2019NRTI backbone\u2019) plus one of:\n  \n\u2022 ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor\n  \n\u2022 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n  \n\u2022 integrase inhibitor.\n1st line drugs commonly used in the UK include:\n  \n\u2022 NRTI backbone: Tenofovir and emtricitabine (combination tablet=Truvada\u00ae), \nabacavir and lamivudine (combination tablet=Kivexa\u00ae). Side-eff ects: GI distur-\nbance, anorexia, pancreatitis, hepatic dysfunction (severe lactic acidosis with \nhepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis reported, caution with hepatitis B/C), \ue001bone-\nmineral density. Avoid abacavir if high risk of CVD. Avoid tenofovir if eGFR <30.\n  \n\u2022 Protease inhibitors: Atazanavir, darunavir. Side-eff ects: hyperglycaemia, insulin \nresistance (mainly 1st-generation drugs), dyslipidaemia, jaundice, and hepatitis.\n  \n\u2022 NNTRI: Rilpivirine (give with food, interaction with proton pump inhibitors), efa-\nvirenz (CNS toxicity, association with suicidality \ue018 care in depression/anxiety, \nadverse lipid pro\ufb01 le). Other side-eff ects: rash, GI disturbance.\n  \n\u2022 Integrase inhibitor: Dolutegravir, elvitegravir, raltegravir. Side-eff ects: rash, GI \ndisturbance, insomnia.\nMonitor: adherence (see BOX \u2018Adherence\u2019), adverse eff ects (LFTs, glucose), virologi-\ncal response (viral load). CD4 counts guide prophylaxis of opportunistic infection \n(values may not correlate with virological response, use viral load preferentially).\nWhat to start\nIn many resource-limited settings, universal access to ART remains an objective \nyet to be achieved. ~50% of those in need of treatment for HIV do not receive \nit. Interim prioritization of those with symptomatic HIV or CD4 count <350 cells/\nmicrolitre may be appropriate as these patients are at high risk of mortality and \nhave most short-term bene\ufb01 t from ART.\nEquality in the treatment of HIV requires:\n  \n\u2022 Eff ective, acceptable, and reliable methods to reduce HIV transmission, including \ntreatment as prevention.\n  \n\u2022 Rapid, accurate, and low-cost diagnosis and monitoring.\n  \n\u2022 Standardization and simpli\ufb01 cation of ART regimens.\n  \n\u2022 Evidence-based ART to prevent the use of sub-standard protocols which compro-\nmise treatment and lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.\n  \n\u2022 Reduced ART costs and/or eff ective allocation of resources.\nResource-limited settings\nVaccines are the most eff ective way to prevent infectious disease. They can also \nbe therapeutic, clearing a virus after infection. HIV vaccines to date have failed to \ninduce an immune response suffi  cient to confer protection. Research is ongoing \ninto neutralizing HIV antibodies, peptides, genes, viral vectors, physiological \u2018boost-\ners\u2019, and mechanisms to counter the mutational evolution of HIV.
