Digital rectal examination for perianal tone and sensation.\n4   Examine for nerve root pain (table 12.3): this is distributed in relevant dermato-\nmes, and is worsened by coughing or bending forward. Straight leg test (L4, L5, \nS1): positive if raising the leg with the knee extended causes pain below the knee, \nwhich increases on foot dorsi\ufb02 exion (Las\u00e8gue\u2019s sign). It suggests irritation to the \nsciatic nerve. The main cause is lumbar disc prolapse.

X-rays\u2014imaging may not always \nbe necessary but can exclude bony abnormalities and fractures. Correlation be-\ntween radiographic abnormalities and clinical features can be poor. MRI is the \nimage of choice and can detect disc prolapse, cord compression (\ufb01 g 12.7), can-\ncer, infection, or in\ufb02 ammation (eg sacroiliitis).\nManagement \ue022Urgent neurosurgical referral if any neurological de\ufb01 cit (see BOX). \nKeep the diagnosis under review. For non-speci\ufb01 c back pain, focus on education \nand self-management. Advise patients to continue normal activites and be ac-\ntive. Regular paracetamol \u00b1 NSAIDS \u00b1 codeine. Consider low-dose amitriptyline/du-\nloxetine if these fail (not SSRIS for pain). Off er physiotherapy, acupuncture, or an \nexercise programme if not improving.4 Address psychosocial issues, which may \npredispose to developing chronic pain and disability (see p559).
