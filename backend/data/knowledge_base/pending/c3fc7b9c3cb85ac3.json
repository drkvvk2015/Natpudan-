In particular, N nitro\nsamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are\nmetabolized to nitrosamine ketone and N0 nitroso\nnornicotine by the cytochrome P450 system, which\nform DNA adducts, leading to mutations and even\ntually cancer. The duration of cigarette exposure is a\ngreater risk factor than the number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day. Cigarette smoking is a greater risk\nfactor than pipe and cigar smoking. Smokers have a\n10 30\u0002 increased risk of developing lung cancer.\n418\nSmoking Cessation", "text_length": 2253, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 424/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 423, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.831704", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.832534", "status": "pending"}
