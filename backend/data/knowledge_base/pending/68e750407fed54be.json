It is often wise to treat (see below) before the \nexact cause is known\u2014usually viral, and often never identi\ufb01 ed. Without the infec-\ntious prodrome consider encephalopathy: hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, drugs, hypoxic brain injury, uraemia, SLE, Wernicke\u2019s (give vit \nB1 if in doubt p714).\nSigns and symptoms\n  \n\u2022 Bizarre encephalopathic behaviour or confusion.\n  \n\u2022 \ue001GCS or coma.\n  \n\u2022 Fever.\n  \n\u2022 Headache.\n  \n\u2022 Focal neurological signs.\n  \n\u2022 Seizures.\n  \n\u2022 History of travel or animal bite.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Viral: HSV-1 & 2, arboviruses, CMV, EBV, VZV (varicella-zoster virus), HIV (seroconver-\nsion), measles, mumps, rabies, Japanese B encephalitis, West Nile virus, tick-borne \nencephalitis.\n  \n\u2022 Non-viral: Any bacterial meningitis, TB, malaria, listeria, Lyme disease, legionella, \nleptospirosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, schistosomiasis, typhus.\nInvestigations\n  \n\u2022 Bloods: Blood cultures; serum for viral PCR (also throat swab and MSU); toxoplasma \nIgM titre; malaria \ufb01 lm.\n  \n\u2022 Contrast-enhanced CT: Focal bilateral temporal lobe involvement is suggestive of \nHSV encephalitis. Meningeal enhancement suggests meningoencephalitis. Do be-\nfore LP. MRI is alternative if allergic to contrast.\n  \n\u2022 LP: Typically moderately \ue000CSF protein and lymphocytes, and \ue001glucose (p822). Send \nCSF for viral PCR including HSV.\n  \n\u2022 EEG: Urgent EEG showing diff use abnormalities may help con\ufb01 rm a diagnosis of \nencephalitis, but does not indicate a cause.\nManagement\n\ue007Mortality in untreated viral encephalitis is ~70%. \ue022Aim to start aciclovir within \n30min of the patient arriving (10mg/kg/8h IV over 1h) for 14d as empirical treat-\nment for HSV (21d if immunosuppressed). Speci\ufb01 c therapies also exist for CMV and \ntoxoplasmosis (p425).\n  \n\u2022 Supportive therapy, in high-dependency unit or ICU environment if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Symptomatic treatment: eg phenytoin for seizures (p826).\nCerebral abscess\nSuspect this in any patient with \ue000ICP, especially if there is fever or \ue000WCC. It may follow \near, sinus, dental, or periodontal infection; skull fracture; congenital heart disease; \nendocarditis; bronchiectasis. It may also occur in the absence of systemic signs of \nin\ufb02 ammation.\nSigns Seizures, fever, localizing signs, or signs of \ue000ICP. Coma. Signs of sepsis else-\nwhere (eg teeth, ears, lungs, endocarditis).\nInvestigations CT/MRI p746 (eg \u2018ring-enhancing\u2019 lesion); \ue000WCC, \ue000ESR; biopsy.\nTreatment Urgent neurosurgical referral; treat \ue000ICP (p830). If frontal sinuses or \nteeth are the source, the likely organism will be Strep. milleri (microaerophilic), \nor oropharyngeal anaerobes. In ear abscesses, B. fragilis or other anaerobes are \nmost common. Bacterial abscesses are often peripheral; toxoplasma lesions (p425) \nare deeper (eg basal ganglia). NB: ask yourself: is the patient immunocompromised? \nDiscuss with infectious diseases/microbiology.", "text_length": 3178, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 832/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 831, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.621806", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.622471", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
