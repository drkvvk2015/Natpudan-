It can \nbe used by medical and nursing staff  for initial and continuing assessment. It has val-\nue in predicting ultimate outcome. Three types of response are assessed, note in each \ncase the best response (or best of any limb) which should be recorded (table 19.1).\nTable 19.1 The Glasgow Coma Scale\n\ue098 Best motor response\nBest verbal response\nEye opening\n6\nObeying commands\n5\nOriented (time, place, \nperson)\n4\nSpontaneous\n5\nLocalizing to pain\n4\nConfused conversation\n3\nIn response to speech\n4\nWithdrawing to pain\n3\nInappropriate speech\n2\nIn response to pain\n3\nFlexor response to pain\n2\nIncomprehensible sounds 1\nNone\n2\nExtensor response to pain\n1\nNone\n1\nNo response to pain\nAdapted from 'Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness: a practical scale', Graham Teasdale and \nBryan Jennett, The Lancet, Vol 304, No. 7872, 81\u201384 (1974), Elsevier.\nAn overall score is made by summing the score in the three areas assessed.\n  \n\u2022 No response to pain + no verbalization + no eye opening = 3.\n  \n\u2022 Severe injury, GCS \u22648\u2014consider airway protection.\n  \n\u2022 Moderate injury, GCS 9\u201312.\n  \n\u2022 Minor injury, GCS 13\u201315.\nCausing pain is not a pleasant thing, there are acceptable and unacceptable meth-\nods. Try \ufb01 ngernail bed pressure with a pen/pencil, sternal pressure (not a rub), or \nsuprascapular squeeze. Abnormal responses to pain can help to localize the damage:\n  \n\u2022 Flexion = decorticate posture (arms bent inwards on chest, thumbs tucked in a \nclenched \ufb01 st, legs extended) implies damage above the level of the red nucleus in \nthe midbrain.\n1\n  \n\u2022 Extension = decerebrate posture (adduction and internal rotation of shoulder, pro-\nnation of forearm) indicates midbrain damage below the level of the red nucleus.\nNB: an abbreviated coma scale, AVPU, is sometimes used in the initial assessment \n(\u2018primary survey\u2019) of the critically ill:\nA = alert\nV = responds to vocal stimuli\nP = responds to pain\nU = unresponsive\nNB: GCS scoring is diff erent in young children; see OHCS p201.\n1 Red nucleus output reinforces upper limb antigravity \ufb02 exion. When its output is damaged, the unregu-\nlated reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts reinforce extension tone of upper and lower limbs.\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale is reproduced from The Lancet, Vol. 304, Teasdale G & Jennet B, Assessment of \nComa and Impaired Consciousness: A Practical Scale, \u00a91974, with permission from Elsevier.", "text_length": 2567, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 796/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 795, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.559363", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.560336", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
