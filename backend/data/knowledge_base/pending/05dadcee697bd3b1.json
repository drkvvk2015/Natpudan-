Non-cardiac: Caff eine; smoking; alcohol; \npneumonia; drugs (\ue0202-agonists, digoxin, L-dopa, tricyclics, doxorubicin); metabolic \nimbalance (K\n+, Ca\n2+, Mg\n2+, hypoxia, hypercapnia, metabolic acidosis, thyroid disease); \nand phaeochromocytoma.\nPresentation Palpitations, chest pain, presyncope/syncope, hypotension, or pulmo-\nnary oedema. Some arrhythmias may be asymptomatic, incidental \ufb01 ndings, eg AF.\nHistory Take a detailed history of palpitations (p36). Ask about precipitating fac-\ntors, onset/off set, nature (fast or slow, regular or irregular), duration, associated \nsymptoms (chest pain, dyspnoea, collapse). Review drug history. Ask about past \nmedical history and family history of cardiac disease and sudden death. Syncope \noccuring during exercise is always concerning; the patient may have a condition \npredisposing them to sudden cardiac death (eg long QT syndrome).\nTests FBC, U&E, glucose, Ca\n2+, Mg\n2+, TSH, ECG: Look for signs of IHD, AF, short PR interval \n(WPW syndrome), long QT interval (metabolic imbalance, drugs, congenital), U waves \n(hypokalaemia). 24h ECG monitoring or other continuous ECG monitoring (see BOX \n\u2018Continuous ECG monitoring\u2019). Echo to look for structural heart disease, eg mitral \nstenosis, HCM. Provocation tests: exercise ECG, cardiac catheterization \u00b1 electro-\nphysiological studies may be needed.\n\ue022Narrow complex tachycardias: See pp806\u20137, 126.\n\ue022Atrial \ufb01 brillation and \ufb02 utter: See pp806\u20137, 130.\n\ue022Broad complex tachycardias: See pp804\u20135, 128.\n\ue022Bradycardia: See p808 (causes and management of acute bradycardia) and p98 \n(heart block). Intermittent, self-resolving bradycardic episodes can cause signi\ufb01 cant \nproblems (eg recurrent syncope). Continuous ECG monitoring (BOX \u2018Continuous ECG \nmonitoring\u2019) will be needed to assist the diagnosis \u00b1specialist tests (eg tilt table \ntesting for re\ufb02 ex syncope). Seek out reversible causes, eg hypothyroidism or medica-\ntions such as \ue020-blockers. In some cases, no reversible cause is found and the inter-\nmittent bradycardia is suffi  ciently dangerous to warrant a permanent pacemaker \n(p132). See BOX, \u2018Sick sinus syndrome\u2019.\nManagement Some arrhythmias can be managed conservatively, eg by reducing \nalcohol intake. Many arrhythmias respond to medical management with regular \ntablets or a \u2018pill in the pocket\u2019. Interventional management may include pacemakers \n(p132), ablation (eg of accessory pathways or arrhythmogenic foci), or implantable \ncardioverter de\ufb01 brillators (ICDs), eg in patients with ventricular arrhythmias post-MI \nand in those with congenital arrhythmogenic conditions (p133).", "text_length": 3232, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 132/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 131, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.085964", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.086710", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
