Accordingly, carotid bruit cannot be used to rule in or rule out\nsurgically amenable carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic preoperative bruits are\nnot predictive of increased risk of perioperative stroke. However, they may be harbingers of transient\npostoperative cognitive and behavioral abnormalities\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 1993 270:23\nCLINICAL CLUES TO DIAGNOSIS\n\u0002\nTHROMBOTIC\nstuttering progression with periods of\nimprovement.
