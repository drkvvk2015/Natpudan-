Rare in men (~1% of all breast cancers).\nRisk factors Risk is related to family history, age, and uninter rupted oestrogen ex-\nposure, hence: nulliparity; 1st pregnancy >30yrs old, early menarche; late menopause; \nHRT; obesity; BRCA genes (p521); not breastfeeding; past breast cancer (metachronous \nrate \u22482%, synchronous rate \u22481%).\nPathology Non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is premalignant and seen as \nmicrocalci\ufb01 cation on mammography (unifocal or widespread). Non-invasive lobular \nCIS is rarer and tends to be multifocal. Invasive ductal carcinoma is most common \n(~70%) whereas invasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10\u201315% of breast cancers. \nMedullary cancers (~5%) tend to aff ect younger patients while colloid/mucoid \n(~2%) tend to aff ect the elderly. Others: papillary, tubular, adenoid-cystic and Pa-\nget\u2019s (p708). 60\u201370% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor +ve, conveying better \nprognosis. ~30% over-express HER2 (growth factor receptor gene) associated with \naggressive disease and poorer prognosis.\nInvestigations (See p82 for history and examination.) \ue007All lumps should undergo \n\u2018triple\u2019 assessment: Clinical examination + histology/cytology + mammography/ul-\ntrasound; see \ufb01 g 13.24.\nStaging: Stage 1: Con\ufb01 ned to breast, mobile. Stage 2: Growth con\ufb01 ned to breast, \nmobile, lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla. Stage 3: Tumour \ufb01 xed to muscle (but not \nchest wall), ipsilateral lymph nodes matted and may be \ufb01 xed, skin involvement larger \nthan tumour. Stage 4: Complete \ufb01 xation of tumour to chest wall, distant metasta-\nses. Also TNM staging: (p523) T1<2cm, T2, 2\u20135cm, T3 >5cm, T4, \ufb01 xity to chest wall or \npeau d\u2019orange; N1, mobile ipsilateral nodes; N2, \ufb01 xed nodes; M1, distant metastases.\nTreating local disease (Stage 1\u20132.)7 \u2022Surgery: Removal of tumour by wide local \nexcision (WLE) or mastectomy \u00b1 breast reconstruction + axillary node sampling/\nsurgical clearance or sentinel node biopsy (BOX \u2018Sentinel node biopsy\u2019). \u2022Radio-\ntherapy: Recommended for all patients with invasive cancer after WLE. Risk of \nrecurrence decreases from 30% to <10% at 10yrs and increases overall survival. \nAxillary radiotherapy used if lymph node +ve on sampling and surgical clearance \nnot performed (\ue000risk of lymphoedema and brachial plexopathy). SE: pneumonitis, \npericarditis, and rib fractures. \u2022Chemotherapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves \nsurvival and reduces recurrence in most groups of women (consider in all except \nexcellent prognosis patients), eg epirubicin + \u2018CMF\u2019 (cyclophosphamide + methotrex-\nate + 5-FU). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown no diff erence in survival but may \nfacilitate breast-conserving surgery. \u2022Endocrine agents: Aim to \ue001 oest rogen activity \nand are used in oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) +ve disease. \nThe ER blocker tamoxifen is widely used, eg 20mg/d PO for 5yrs post-op (may rarely \ncause uterine cancer so warn to report vaginal bleeding). Aromatase inhibitors (eg \nanastrozole) targeting peripheral oestrogen synthesis are also used (may be better \ntolerated). They are only used if post-menopausal. If pre-menopausal and an ER+ve \ntumour, ovarian ablation (via surgery or radiotherapy) or GnRH anal ogues (eg gos-\nerelin) \ue001 recurrence and \ue000 survival.  \u2022Support: Breastcare nurses \u2022Reconstruction \noptions: Eg tissue expanders/implants/nipple tattoos, latissimus dorsi \ufb02 ap, TRAM \n(transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) \ufb02 ap.\nTreating distant disease (Stage 3\u20134.)8 Long-term survival is possible and median \nsurvival is >2yrs. Staging investigations should include CXR, bone scan, liver USS, CT/\nMRI or PET-CT (p739), + LFTS and Ca\n2+. Radiotherapy (p526) to painful bony lesions (bis-\nphosphonates, p677, may \ue001 pain and fracture risk). Tamoxifen is often used in ER+ve; \nif relapse after initial success, consider chemotherapy. Trastuzumab should be given \nfor HER2 +ve tumours, in combination with chemotherapy. CNS surgery for solitary (or \neasily accessible) metastases may be possible; if not\u2014radiotherapy. Get specialist help \nfor arm lymphoedema (try decongestive methods \ufb01 rst).\nPreventing deaths \u2022Promote awareness. \u2022Screening: 2-view mammography every \n3yrs for women aged 47\u201373 in UK has \ue001 breast cancer deaths by 30% in women >50yrs.", "text_length": 4440, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 610/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 609, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.229055", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.229964", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
