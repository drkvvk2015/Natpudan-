This may occur suddenly in the previously healthy liver \n= acute liver failure (hyperacute = onset \u2264 7d; acute = 8\u201321d; subacute = 4\u201326wks.) \nMore often it occurs on a background of cirrhosis = chronic liver failure. Fulminant \nhepatic failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from massive necrosis of liver cells \nleading to severe impairment of liver function.\nCauses Infections: Viral hepatitis (esp. B, C, CMV), yellow fever, leptospirosis. Drugs: \nParacetamol overdose, halothane, isoniazid. Toxins: Amanita phalloides mushroom \n(\ufb01 g 6.26), carbon tetrachloride. Vascular: Budd\u2013Chiari syn. (p696), veno-occlusive \ndisease. Others: Alcohol, fatty liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis, primary \nsclerosing cholangitis, haemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, \ue0251-antitrypsin de-\n\ufb01 ciency, Wilson\u2019s disease, fatty liver of pregnancy (OHCS p25), malignancy.\nSigns Jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy (see BOX \u2018Hepatic encephalopathy\u2019), fetor \nhepaticus (smells like pear drops), asterixis/\ufb02 ap (p50), constructional apraxia (can-\nnot copy a 5-pointed star?). Signs of chronic liver disease (p276) suggest acute-on-\nchronic hepatic failure.\nTests Blood: FBC (?infection,\n26 ?GI bleed), U&E,\n27 LFT, clotting (\ue000PT/INR), glucose, para-\ncetamol level, hepatitis, CMV and EBV serology, ferritin, \ue0251-antitrypsin, caeruloplasmin, \nautoantibodies (p284). Microbiology: Blood culture; urine culture; ascitic tap for \nMC&S of ascites\u2014neutrophils >250/mm\n3 indicates spontaneous bact erial peritonitis \n(p276). Radiology: CXR; abdominal ultrasound; Doppler \ufb02 ow studies of the portal vein \n(and hepatic vein in suspected Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome, p696). Neuro physiology: EEG, \nevoked potentials (and neuroimaging) have a limited role.\nManagement \ue022Beware sepsis, hypoglycaemia, GI bleeds/varices, & encephalopathy:\n  \n\u2022 Nurse with a 20\u00b0 head-up tilt in ITU. Protect the airway with intubation and in-\nsert an NG tube to avoid aspiration and remove any blood from stomach.\n  \n\u2022 Insert urinary and central venous catheters to help assess \ufb02 uid status.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor T\u00b0, respirations, pulse, BP, pupils, urine output hourly. Daily weights.\n  \n\u2022 Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and INR daily.\n  \n\u2022 10% glucose IV, 1L/12h to avoid hypoglycaemia. Do blood glucose every 1\u20134h.\n  \n\u2022 Treat the cause, if known (eg GI bleeds, sepsis, paracetamol poisoning, p844).\n  \n\u2022 If malnourished, get dietary help: good nutrition can decrease mortality. Give \nthiamine and folate supplements (p714).\n  \n\u2022 Treat seizures with phenytoin (p826). 11\n  \n\u2022 Haemo\ufb01 ltration or haemodialysis, if renal failure develops (BOX \u2018What is hepato-\nrenal syndrome?\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 Try to avoid sedatives and other drugs with hepatic metabolism (BOX \u2018Prescrib-\ning in liver failure\u2019 and BNF).\n  \n\u2022 Consider PPI as prophylaxis against stress ulceration, eg omeprazole 40mg/d IV/PO.\n  \n\u2022 Liaise early with nearest transplant centre regarding appropriateness.\nTreat complications Cerebral oedema: On ITU: 20% mannitol IV; hyperventilate.\nAscites: Restrict \ufb02 uid, low-salt diet, weigh daily, diuretics (p276).\nBleeding: Vitamin K 10mg/d IV for 3d, platelets, FFP + blood as needed \u00b1 endoscopy.\nBlind \ue057 of infection: Ceftriaxone 1\u20132g/24h IV, not gentamicin (\ue000risk of renal failure).\n\ue001Blood glucose: If \ue0052mmol/L or symptomatic, \ue014 50mL of 50% glucose IV; check often.\nEncephalopathy: Avoid sedatives; 20\u00b0 head-up tilt in ITU; correct electrolytes; \nlactulose 30\u201350mL/8h (aim for 2\u20134 soft stools/d) is catabolized by bacterial \ufb02 ora \nto short-chain fatty acids which \ue001colonic pH and trap NH3 in the colon as NH4\n+ ; \nRifaximin 550mg/12h is a non-absorbable oral antibiotic that \ue001 numbers of nitrogen-\nforming gut bacteria.\nWorse prognosis if Grade III\u2013IV encephalopathy, age >40yrs, albumin <30g/L, \ue000INR, \ndrug-induced liver failure, late-onset hepatic failure worse than fulminant failure. \n26 Neutrophilic leucocytosis need not mean a secondary infection: alcoholic hepatitis may be the cause.\n27 Urea is synthesized in the liver, so is a poor test of renal function in liver failure; use creatinine instead.", "text_length": 4246, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 282/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 281, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.532174", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.532872", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
