Includes individuals where \nrisk traditionally lower: younger age, normotensive, no DM, non-obese.

Contributing factors: side eff ect of ART, increased prevalence of risk fac-\ntors, eg poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol, low vitamin D levels. Risk assess and \nconsider bisphosphonate.\n  \n\u2022 TB: All patients with TB and HIV need ART (as soon as TB treatment tolerated and \nwithin 2 weeks if CD4 <100 cells/microlitre). Seek expert advice and refer to local \nguidelines. Consider Truvada\u00ae plus efavirenz as 1st line in UK (serum levels of \nintegrase inhibitors are decreased by rifampicin). See ART, pp402\u20133, TB, pp394\u20135.\n  \n\u2022 Hepatitis B (HBV): Co-infection requires an ART regimen including antivirals with \nanti-HBV activity, eg tenofovir plus emtricitabine (not lamivudine or emtricit-\nabine as a single agent due to potential for emergence of HBV resistance).\n  \n\u2022 Hepatitis C (HCV): Assess all with HIV for HCV treatment. Pegylated interferon effi  -\ncacy is less with lower CD4 count.
