It occurs in the circulation (intravascular) or in the reticuloendothelial sys-\ntem, ie macrophages of liver, spleen, and bone marrow (extravascular). In sickle-cell \nanaemia, lifespan may be as short as 5d. Haemolysis may be asymptomatic, but if \nthe bone marrow does not compensate suffi  ciently, a haemolytic anaemia results.\nAn approach is \ufb01 rst to con\ufb01 rm haemolysis and then \ufb01 nd the cause\u2014try to \nanswer these four questions:\n1   Is there increased red cell breakdown?\n  \n\u2022 Anaemia with normal or \ue000MCV.\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice).\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Urinary urobilinogen (no urinary conjugated bilirubin).\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Serum LDH, as it is released from red cells.\n2   Is there increased red cell production?\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Reticulocytes, causing \ue000MCV (reticulocytes are large immature RBCS) and poly-\nchromasia.\n3   Is the haemolysis mainly extra- or intravascular?\nExtravascular haemolysis may lead to splenic hypertrophy and splenomegaly.\nFeatures of intravascular haemolysis are:\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Free plasma haemoglobin: released from RBCS.\n  \u2022 Methaemalbuminaemia: some free Hb is broken down in the circulation to pro-\nduce haem and globin; haem combines with albumin to make methaemalbumin.\n  \n\u2022 \ue001Plasma haptoglobin: mops up free plasma Hb, then removed by the liver.\n  \n\u2022 Haemoglobinuria: causes red-brown urine, in absence of red blood cells.\n  \n\u2022 Haemosiderinuria: occurs when haptoglobin-binding capacity is exceeded, \ncausing free Hb to be \ufb01 ltered by the renal glomeruli, with absorption of free \nHb via the renal tubules and storage in the tubular cells as haemosiderin. This \nis detected in the urine as sloughed tubular cells by Prussian blue staining ~1 \nweek after onset (implying a chronic intravascular haemolysis).\n4   Why is there haemolysis? Causes are on p338.\nHistory Family history, race, jaundice, dark urine, drugs, previous anaemia, travel.\nExamination Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, gallstones (pigmented, due to \ue000bili-\nrubin from haemolysis), leg ulcers (due to poor blood \ufb02 ow).\nTests FBC, reticulocytes, bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin, urinary urobilinogen. Thick and \nthin \ufb01 lms for malaria screen if history of travel. The blood \ufb01 lm may show poly-\nchromasia and macrocytosis due to reticulocytes, or point to the diagnosis:\n  \n\u2022 Hypochromic microcytic anaemia (thalassaemia).\n  \n\u2022 Sickle cells (sickle-cell anaemia).\n  \n\u2022 Schistocytes (\ufb01 g 8.30, p339; microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia).\n  \n\u2022 Abnormal cells in haematological malignancy.\n  \n\u2022 Spherocytes (hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia).\n  \n\u2022 Elliptocytes (\ufb01 g 8.36, p339; hereditary elliptocytosis).\n  \n\u2022 Heinz bodies, \u2018bite\u2019 cells (\ufb01 g 8.32, p339; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\nde\ufb01 ciency).\nFurther tests (if the cause is still not obvious)\n  \n\u2022 Osmotic fragility testing will con\ufb01 rm the presence of membrane abnormalities \nwhich have been identi\ufb01 ed on the \ufb01 lm.\n  \n\u2022 Hb electrophoresis will detect haemoglobinopathies.\n  \u2022 The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT, \ufb01 g 8.28) identi\ufb01 es red cells coated with \nantibody or complement, the presence of which indicates an immune cause.\n  \n\u2022 Enzyme assays are reserved for when other causes have been excluded.", "text_length": 3399, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 344/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 343, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.754839", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.755867", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
