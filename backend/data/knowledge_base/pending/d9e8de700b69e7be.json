Ask someone to call the arrest team and bring the \nde\ufb01 brillator. Note the time. ABC:\n \n\ue022Airway: Head tilt (if no spine injury) and chin lift/jaw thrust.\n \n\ue022Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If there \nis any doubt whether breathing is normal, proceed to chest compressions.\n \n\ue022Chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand on the centre of the chest (lower \nhalf of the stenum). Place your second hand on top and interlock \ufb01 ngers. Use \nstraight arms. Give compressions at a rate of 100\u2013120/min. Aim to compress the \nsternum 5\u20136cm. After 30 compressions give 2 rescue breaths. Do not interrupt \ncompressions >10s. Continue with a ratio of 30:2 until de\ufb01 brillator is available.\nAdvanced life support See algorithm \ufb01 g A3.\n  \n\u2022 Continue chest compressions while adhesive de\ufb01 brillation/monitoring pads are \nput in place. Plan all actions before pausing chest compressions.\n  \n\u2022 Stop chest compression for <5s to assess rhythm. Determine whether the rhythm is \nshockable (VF/pulseless VT) or non-shockable (asystole, pulseless electrical activity).\nShockable rhythm: VF/pulseless VT\n \n\ue022A single person performs uninterrupted chest compressions while everyone else \nprepares for de\ufb01 brillation: stand clear, move oxygen delivery device 1m away.\n \n\ue022Select the appropriate energy on the de\ufb01 brillator (150J or manufacturer's guide-\nlines). When de\ufb01 brillator is charged and safety check complete, the rescuer per-\nforming chest compressions stands clear and the shock is delivered.\n \n\ue022CPR is resumed immediately (30:2). Reassess pulse/rhythm only after 2 minutes of CPR.\n \n\ue022Repeat if shockable rhythm remains. Give drugs after 3 shocks (see Drugs, this topic).\nNon-shockable rhythm: asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA)\n \n\ue022Continue CPR 30:2. Obtain IV access and secure airway. Once airway secure switch \nto continuous compressions and ventilation. Give adrenaline 1mg IV.\n \n\ue022Check rhythm every 2 minutes.\n \n\ue022Consider reversible causes (4HS and 4TS: hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hyper/hypokalae-\nmia/other metabolic derangement, hypothermia, thrombosis, tension pneumotho-\nrax, tamponade, toxins).\nDrugs\n  \n\u2022 Give adrenaline 1mg IV every 3\u20135 mins for both shockable (from 3rd shock) and non-\nshockable rhythms. In practice this means at every other rhythm check or shock.\n1\n  \n\u2022 In shockable rhythms give amiodarone 300mg IV after 3 de\ufb01 brillation attempts. \nConsider a further 150mg IV after 5 shocks. Lidocaine is an alternative.\nDiscontinuing resuscitation Needs clinical judgement: what is the likelihood of \nachieving a successful return of spontaneous circulation? If there is a shockable \nrhythm or a reversible cause then attempts are usually continued. It is reasonable \nto discontinue if asystole >20mins without a reversible cause. Ask for the opinion of \nothers in the resuscitation team.\nResuscitation decisions Consider, discuss, and record CPR decisions:\n  \n\u2022 at the request of a patient with capacity\n  \n\u2022 as part of end-of-life care (p12, p536)\n  \n\u2022 in deteriorating, severe illness.\n\ue007Your patient should be involved in decisions about CPR (unless it would cause physi-\ncal or psychological harm). Explain your clinical decision to them, including futility.\n\ue007Do not make judgements about the quality of life of others based on your own \nperception.\n1 Meta-analysis fails to show that adrenaline increases survival to hospital discharge (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.\ngov/pubmed/24193240).
