In the \ufb01 rst year of life, adult haemoglobin replaces fetal \nhaemoglobin (HbF).\nIt might be thought that because the molecular details of the thalassaemias are \nso well worked out they represent a perfect example of the reductionist principle \nat work: \ufb01 nd out exactly what is happening within molecules, and you will be able \nto explain all the manifestations of a disease. But this is not so. We have to recog-\nnize that two people with the identical mutation at their \ue020 loci may have quite dif-\nferent diseases. Co-inheritance of other genes and conditions (eg \ue025 thalassaemia) \nis part of the explanation, as is the effi  ciency of production of fetal haemoglobin. \nThe reasons lie beyond simple co-segregation of genes promoting the formation \nof fetal Hb. The rate of proteolysis of excess \ue025-globin chains may also be impor-\ntant\u2014as may mechanisms that have little to do with genetic or molecular events. \nStructure of haemoglobin", "text_length": 2008, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 351/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 350, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.766752", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.769279", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
