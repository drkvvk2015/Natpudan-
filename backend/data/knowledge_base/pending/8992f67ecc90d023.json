Functional MRI studies show old \nideas that processing of abstract words is con\ufb01 ned to the left hemisphere whereas \nconcrete words are processed on the right are too simplistic. \n7 It may be better to \nthink of a mosaic of language centres in the brain with more or less specialized \nfunctions. There is evidence that tool-naming is handled diff erently and in a diff erent \narea to fruit-naming. There are also individual diff erences in the anatomy of these \nmosaics. This is depressing for those who want a rigid classi\ufb01 cation of aphasia, \nbut a source of hope to those who have had a stroke: recovery may be better than \nneuroimaging leads us to believe.\nProblems with classifying dysphasias\nStart by reassuring the patient \u2018I know this may be diffi  cult...\u2019 and try to engage \nin conversation; asking questions that need to phrase to answer (ie not just yes/\nno). This tests \ufb02 uency and reception, understanding, and allows assessment of \narticulation, eg \u2018How did you travel here today?\u2019, \u2018I came by bus\u2019. Then assess \ndysphasia by asking: \u2018What is this\u2019 eg pen (tests for nominal dysphasia), repeat \n\u2018British Constitution\u2019 (tests for conduction dysphasia and dysarthria). Then ask \npatient to follow one-, two-, and three-step commands ensuring these \u2018cross the \nmidline\u2019, eg make a \ufb01 st with your right hand then extend your right index \ufb01 nger \nand touch your left ear.\nAssessing higher mental function: a practical guide\nSymptoms of movement disorders\nAthetosis is due to a lesion in the putamen, causing slow sinuous writhing move-\nments in the hands, which are present at rest. Pseudoathetosis refers to athetoid \nmovements in patients with severe proprioceptive loss.\nChorea means dance (hence \u2018choreography\u2019)\u2014a \ufb02 ow of jerky movements, \ufb02 itting \nfrom one limb to another (each seemingly a fragment of a normal movement). \nDistinguish from athetosis/pseudoathetosis (above-mentioned), and hemiballis-\nmus (p468). Causes: Basal ganglia lesion (stroke, Huntington\u2019s, p702); streptococci \n(Sydenham\u2019s chorea; St Vitus\u2019 dance, p142); SLE (p554); Wilson\u2019s (p285); neonatal ker-\nnicterus; polycythaemia (p366); neuroacanthocytosis (genetic, with acanthocytes in \nperipheral blood, chorea, oro-facial dyskinesia, and axonal neuropathy); hyperthy-\nroidism (p218); drugs (levodopa, oral contraceptives/HRT, chlorpromazine, cocaine\u2014\n\u2018crack dancing\u2019). The early stages of chorea may be detected by feeling \ufb02 uctuations \nin muscle tension while the patient grips your \ufb01 nger.\n\ue057: Dopamine antagonists, eg tetrabenazine 12.5mg/12h (/24h if elderly) PO; increase, \neg to 25mg/8h PO; max 200mg/d.\nHemiballismus is uncontrolled unilateral \ufb02 ailing movements of proximal limb joints \ncaused by contralateral subthalamic lesions. See p468.\nCerebellar signs\nSpeech: Slurred/ataxic/staccato. Eye movements: Nystagmus. Tone and power: \nHypotonia and reduced power. Coordination: Finger-to-nose test; test for dysdiado-\nchokinesis, p499. Gait: Broad based, patients fall to the side of the lesion. Romberg's \ntest: ask patient to stand with eyes closed. If he/she loses balance, the test is posi-\ntive and a sign of posterior column disease. Cerebellar disease is Romberg negative.\n(DASHING: Dysdiadochokinesis, Ataxia, Slurred speech, Hypotonia and reduced \npower, Intention tremor, Nystagmus, broad based Gait.)\nMovement disorders", "text_length": 3760, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 99/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 98, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.030512", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.031281", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
