This can be mass eff ect, oedema, or obstruction to \ufb02 uid out\ufb02 ow. Normal \nICP in adults is <15mmHg.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Primary or metastatic tumours.\n  \n\u2022 Head injury.\n  \n\u2022 Haemorrhage (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular).\n  \n\u2022 Infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess.\n  \n\u2022 Hydrocephalus.\n  \n\u2022 Cerebral oedema.\n  \n\u2022 Status epilepticus.\nSigns and symptoms\n  \n\u2022 Headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting.\n  \n\u2022 Altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma.\n  \n\u2022 History of trauma.\n  \n\u2022 \ue001HR and \ue000BP (Cushing\u2019s response); Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration.\n  \n\u2022 Pupil changes (constriction at \ufb01 rst, later dilation\u2014do not mask these signs by using \nagents such as tropicamide to dilate the pupil to aid fundoscopy).\n  \n\u2022 \ue001Visual acuity; peripheral visual \ufb01 eld loss.\n  \n\u2022 Papilloedema is an unreliable sign, but venous pulsation at the disc may be absent \n(absent in ~50% of normal people, but loss of it is a useful sign).\nInvestigations\n  \n\u2022 U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture.\n  \n\u2022 Consider toxicology screen.\n  \n\u2022 CXR\u2014any source of infection that might indicate abscess?\n  \n\u2022 CT head.\n  \n\u2022 Then consider LP if safe. Measure the opening pressure!\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.22. The goal is to \ue001ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent \nneurosurgery is required for the de\ufb01 nitive treatment of \ue000ICP from focal causes (eg \nhaematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or \nbolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in \ufb01 g 19.22.\nHerniation syndromes\nUncal herniation is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsi-\nlateral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against \nthe midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a \ndilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a \ufb01 xed pupil localizes a lesion poorly \nbut is \u2018ipsilateralizing\u2019). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis \n(pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending re-\nticular activating system (ARAS) in the midbrain.\nCerebellar tonsil herniation is caused by \ue000pressure in the posterior fossa forcing \nthe cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and \nupgoing plantar re\ufb02 exes occur \ufb01 rst, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing, \nand apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and \npoor compliance in, the posterior fossa.\nSubfalcian (cingulate) herniation is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus \n(medial frontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the \nanterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke\u2014eg contralateral leg \nweakness \u00b1 abulia (lack of decision-making).", "text_length": 3053, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 838/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 837, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.630758", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.631703", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
