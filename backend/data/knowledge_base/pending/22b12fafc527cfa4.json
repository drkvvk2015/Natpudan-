Her mother \nrinsed her soiled nappies into the house drains \nwhere faulty brickwork allowed mixing with the \nwater supply of the Broad St pump (\ufb01 g 9.37). From \nthis con\ufb02 uence sprung the discipline of Public \nHealth. The ensuing deaths from cholera clustered \naround the Broad St pump, as detailed by the lo-\ncal doctor, Dr John Snow. He used his now famous \nVoronoi diagram showing the deaths within a \u2018line \nof nearest pump\u2019 to motiv ate the parish vestry: \n\u2018In consequence of what I said, the handle of the \npump was removed the following day\u2019, so inaugu-\nrating the control of cholera. These events illustrate \na number of truths:\n1   Knowledge of the microscopic cause of disease is not required for public health \nmeasures to succeed (Vibrio cholerae was identi\ufb01 ed by Robert Kock in 1883).\n2   Even the most parochial are capable of life-saving action when assisted by a \ndoctor in command of the facts.\n3   In\ufb02 uential friends help. Snow remained largely unknown until the 1930s when \nOn the Mode of Communication of Cholera was republished by Wade Hampton \nFrost, \ufb01 rst professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins School.\n4   Randomization (Broad St pump versus an alternative water supply) is king.\nOn the mode of communication of cholera\nDiarrhoea with blood (dysentery)\nShigella (sonnei, \ufb02 exneri, dysenteriae, boydii): Gram \u03a9ve anaerobe. Presentation: \nwatery or bloody diarrhoea, pain, tenesmus, fever 1\u20132d after exposure. Lasts ~5\u20137d. \ue000 \nin MSM. Complications: bacteraemia, reactive arthritis (~2% of \ufb02 exneri), HUS (Shiga-\ntoxin-producing dysenteriae, p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immuno-\nassay. Treatment: supportive. Nutrition: green bananas (\ue000short-chain fatty acids \nin colon), zinc if age <6y, vitamin A. Antibiotics if systemically unwell, immunosup-\npressed. Guided by local sensitivities (cipro\ufb02 oxacin, azithromycin). Avoid antidiar-\nrhoeal agents: risk of toxic dilatation.\nEnterohaemorrhagic/Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), eg O157:H7: Gram \u03a9ve \nanaerobe. Produces veratoxins which are \u2018Shiga-like\u2019 due to similarity with Shigella \ndysenteriae. Presentation: incubation 3\u20138d. Diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis. HUS in \nup to 10% (p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay for Shiga-toxin. \nTreatment: Supportive. Do not give antibiotics: \ue000 risk of HUS.\nCampylobacter: Gram \u03a9ve, spiral-shaped rod. Presentation: incubation 1\u201310d (usu-\nally 2\u20135d). Bloody diarrhoea, pain, fever, headache. Complications: bacteraemia, \nhepatitis, pancreatitis, miscarriage, reactive arthritis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9. Diagnosis: \nstool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay. Treatment: supportive. Antibiotics only in \ninvasive cases, refer to local sensitivities (macrolide, doxycycline, quinolone).\nSalmonella enterocolitis (non-typhoidal): Gram \u03a9ve, anaerobic, motile bacilli. Pres-\nentation: diarrhoea, cramps, fever, usually within 12\u201336h of exposure. Invasive infec-\ntion (<10%) can cause bacteraemia/sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis. \nDiagnosis: stool culture. PCR. Treatment: supportive. Meta-analysis shows no evi-\ndence of bene\ufb01 t for antibiotics in healthy people. Consider in severe/extra-intestinal \ndisease according to local sensitivities (quinolone, macrolide).\nYersinia enterocolitica: Gram \u03a9ve rod. Presentation: incubation 4\u20137d. Diarrhoea, \nfever, pain (may mimic appendicitis), vomiting. May last 1\u20133wk. Also erythema \nnodosum, reactive arthritis (~1 month after diarrhoea). Diagnosis: stool culture, \nagglutination titres. Treatment: antibiotics in severe disease depending on local sen-\nsitivities (aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, quinolone).\n\ue007 See also: Staph. aureus pre-formed toxin (p388), GI parasites (pp432\u20133),\nClostridium dif\ufb01 cile (p411).\nFig 9.37 Death\u2019s Dispensary, \nGeorge Pinwell, 1866.\n\u00a9 Granger, NYC / Topfoto", "text_length": 3975, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 439/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 438, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.928646", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.929459", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
