The most useful signs occur at 24 hours after cardiac arrest and earlier prognosis\nshould not be made by clinical examination alone. These data provide prognostic information, rather than\ntreatment recommendations, which must be made on an individual basis incorporating many other variables\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2004 291:7\nHypoxemia\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nR TO L SHUNT (unresponsive to supplemental O2,\nV/Q <1)\nARDS, HF, pneumonia, alveolar hemor\nrhage, atelectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malfor\nmation, intracardiac shunt (ASD, VSD, PFO)\nV/Q MISMATCH (V/Q >1)\npneumonia, ARDS,\nasthma, COPD, fibrosis, pulmonary embolism,\ntumor filled alveoli, atelectasis, HF\nDIFFUSION DEFECTS\ninterstitial lung disease,\nPJP, atypical pneumonia\nHYPOVENTILATION (A a normal)\n\u0004 CNS\nsedating drugs, tumor, stroke, sleep\napnea\n\u0004\nNEUROMUSCULAR\nbotulism, Guillain Barre, ALS,\nmyxedema\n\u0004\nUPPER\nAIRWAY\nOBSTRUCTION\nepiglottitis,\nlaryngospasm\n\u0004\nLOWER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION\nCOPD, asthma\n\u0004\nDEAD SPACE VENTILATION\ninfection\nLOW O2 PARTIAL PRESSURE (A a normal)\nhigh\naltitude\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nDEFINITION OF HYPOXEMIA\nPaO2 <60 mmHg.\nNote that hypoxia refers specifically to decreased\noxygen supply to tissues and organs\nINVESTIGATIONS\nBASIC\n\u0004\nLABS\nCBCD, lytes, urea, Cr, troponin/CK, lactate\n\u0004\nIMAGING\nCXR, CT chest\n\u0004 ABG\n\u0004 ECG\nDIAGNOSTIC ISSUES\nOXIMETRY\n\u0004\nNORMAL\n>90% is normal.

Exclude diffusion defects and low partial pressure\nof O2\n3. Check PaCO2. If normal or low, then hypoventila\ntion is excluded. This leaves either shunt or V/Q\nmismatch, which can be distinguished with\nresponse to O2 (absence of response suggests\nshunt. V/Q mismatch should respond to O2)\n4. If high PaCO2, then hypoventilation is present.\nCheck A a gradient to determine if co existing\nshunt or V/Q mismatch (presence of A a gra\ndient suggests yes and should check response\nto\nO2\nto\ndistinguish\nbetween\nthese\ntwo\npossibilities)\n92\nHypoxemia", "text_length": 3261, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 104/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 103, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.383269", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.386805", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
