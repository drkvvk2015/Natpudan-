Consider evidence for peritonism, chest, urinary, \nwound, or cannula site infections, as well as possible endocarditis, meningism, or DVT \n(also causes \ue000\u00b0T). Send blood for FBC, U&E, CRP, and cultures (\u00b1LFT). Dipstick the urine. \nConsider MSU, CXR, and abdominal ultrasound/CT depending on clinical \ufb01 ndings.\nConfusion may manifest as agitation, disorientation, and attempts to leave hospital, \nespecially at night. Gently reassure the patient in well-lit surroundings. See p484 for \na full work-up. Common causes are:\n  \n\u2022 hypoxia (pneumonia, atelectasis, LVF, PE) \n\u2022 infection (see earlier)\n  \n\u2022 drugs (opiates, sedatives, and many others) \n\u2022 alcohol withdrawal (p280)\n  \n\u2022 urinary retention \n\u2022 liver/renal failure.\n  \n\u2022 MI or stroke\nOccasionally, sedation is necessary to examine the patient; consider lorazepam 1mg \nPO/IM (antidote: \ufb02 umazenil) or haloperidol 0.5\u20132mg IM. Reassure relatives that post-\nop confusion is common (seen in up to 40%) and reversible.\nDyspnoea or hypoxia Any previous lung disease? Sit patient up and give O2,  monitor \nperipheral O2 sats by pulse oximetry (p162). Examine for evidence of: \u2022pneum onia, \npulmonary collapse, or aspiration \u2022LVF (MI; \ufb02 uid overload) \u2022pulmonary embolism \n(p190) \u2022pneumothorax (p190; due to CVP line, intercostal block, or mechanical ventila-\ntion). Tests: FBC; ABG; CXR; ECG. Manage according to \ufb01 ndings.\n\ue001BP If severe, tilt bed head-down and give O2. Check pulse and BP yourself; compare \nit with pre-op values. Post-op \ue001BP is often from hypovolaemia resulting from inad-\nequate \ufb02 uid input, so check \ufb02 uid chart and replace losses. Monitor urine output \n(may need catheterization). A CVP line can help monitor \ufb02 uid resuscitation (normal \nis 0\u20135cmH2O relative to sternal angle). Hypovolaemia may also be caused by haem-\norrhage so review wounds, drains, and abdomen. If unstable, return to theatre for \nhaemostasis. Beware cardiogenic and neurogenic causes and look for evidence of MI \nor PE. Consider sepsis and anaphylaxis. Management: p790.\n\ue000BP may be from pain, urinary retention, idiopathic hypertension (eg missed medi-\ncation), or inotropic drugs. Oral cardiac medications (including antihypertensives) \nshould be continued throughout the perioperative period even if NBM. Treat the \ncause, consider increasing the regular medication, or if not absorbing orally try 50mg \nlabetalol IV over 1min (see p140).\n\ue001Urine output (oliguria) Aim for output of >30mL/h in adults (or >0.5mL/kg/h). \nAnuria may re\ufb02 ect a blocked or malsited catheter (see p763) rather than AKI. Flush \nor replace catheter. Oliguria is usually due to too little replacement of lost \ufb02 uid. Treat \nby increasing \ufb02 uid input. \ue007Acute kidney injury may follow shock, drugs, transfusion, \npancreatitis, or trauma (see p300 for classi\ufb01 cation and management of AKI).\n  \n\u2022 Review \ufb02 uid chart and examine for signs of volume depletion.\n  \n\u2022 Urinary retention is also common, so examine for a palpable bladder.\n  \n\u2022 Establish normovolaemia (a CVP line may help); you may need 1L/h IVI for 2\u20133h. A \n\u2018\ufb02 uid challenge\u2019 of 250\u2013500mL over 30min may also help.\n  \n\u2022 Catheterize bladder (for accurate monitoring)\u2014see p762; check U&E.\n  \n\u2022 If intrinsic renal failure is suspected, stop nephrotoxic drugs (eg NSAIDS, ACE-i) and \nrefer to a nephrologist early.\nNausea/vomiting Any mechanical obstruction, ileus, or emetic drugs (opiates, dig -\noxin, anaesthetics)? Consider AXR, NGT, and an anti-emetic (\ue007not metoclopramide \nbecause of its prokinetic property). See p251 for choice of anti-emetics.\n\ue001Na\n+ Pre-op level? Excess IV \ufb02 uids may exacerbate the situation. Correct slowly \n(p672). SIADH (p673) can be precipitated by pain, nausea, opioids, and chest infection.", "text_length": 4022, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 584/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 583, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.182357", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.183071", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
