The pain usually occurs during rest and resolves rapidly with short-acting \nnitrates (eg GTN spray). ECG during pain shows ST segment elevation.\nRisks and triggers: Smoking increases risk but hypertension and hypercholester-\nolaemia do not. Probable triggers include cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, low \nmagnesium, and artery instrumentation (eg during angiography).\nTreatment: Avoid triggers. Correct low magnesium. Stop smoking. PRN GTN. Cal-\ncium channel blockers \u00b1 long-acting nitrates. Avoid non-selective \ue020-blockers, aspi-\nrin, and triptans. Prognosis is usually very good.\nVasospastic angina (Prinzmetal angina)\nInvestigations for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) include:\n  \n\u2022 Exercise ECG\u2014assess for ischaemic ECG changes.\n  \n\u2022 Angiography\u2014either using cardiac CT with contrast, or transcatheter angiogra-\nphy (more invasive but can be combined with stenting, p112).\n  \n\u2022 Functional imaging (see p108): myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echo \n(echo whilst undergoing exercise or receiving dobutamine), cardiac MRI.\nNICE recommend the following investigations when considering stable angina.\n13\nTypical angina in a patient with previously proven IHD:\nTreat as stable angina; if further con\ufb01 rmation is required, use non-invasive testing, \neg exercise ECG.\nTypical and atypical angina:\nCT angiography, \ufb01 g 3.20. If inconclusive, use functional imaging as 2nd line and \ntranscatheter angiography as 3rd line.\nNon-anginal chest pain:\nDoes the patient have ischaemic changes on 12 lead ECG?\n  \n\u2022 Yes: investigate as per typical and atypical angina\n  \n\u2022 No: no further investigations for IHD at this point (unless high clinical suspicion \nof IHD for other reasons\u2014discuss with a specialist). Ensure alternative chest pain \ndiagnoses are adequately explored.  \nThese are guidelines and must be interpreted within the clinical context.\nFurther investigations:\nIf the patient has typical angina but few risk factors for IHD, be sure to look for \npossible precipitating or exacerbating factors, for example severe anaemia or \ncardiomyopathy.\nFig 3.20 CT angiogram data has been used to construct this 3D image.
