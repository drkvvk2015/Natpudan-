Incidence: UK 3/million/yr. ~5% \nare associated with MEN-1 (p223). GH stimulates bone and soft tissue \ngrowth through \ue000secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).\nSymptoms Acroparaesthesia (akron=extremities); amenor-\nrhoea; \ue001libido; headache; \ue000sweating; snoring; arthralgia; backache; \n\ufb01 g 5.28: \u2018My rings don\u2019t \ufb01 t, nor my old shoes, and now I\u2019ve got a \nwonky bite (malocclusion) and curly hair. I put on lots of weight, \nall muscle and looked good for a while; now I look so haggard\u2019. \nSigns (BOX \u2018Signs of acromegaly\u2019.) Often predate diagnosis by \n>4yrs. If acromegaly occurs before bony epiphyses fuse (rare), \ngigantism occurs.\nComplications (May present with CCF or ketoacidosis.) \n  \n\u2022 Impaired glucose tolerance (~40%), DM (~15%). \n  \n\u2022 Vascular: \ue000BP, left ventricular hypertrophy (\u00b1dilatation/CCF), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhy thmias. There is \ue000risk of ischaemic heart \ndisease and stroke (?due to \ue000BP \u00b1 insulin resistance and GH-in-\nduced increase in \ufb01 brinogen and decrease in protein S). \n  \n\u2022 Neoplasia: \ue000colon cancer risk; colonoscopy may be needed.21\nAcromegaly in pregnancy (Subfertility is common.) Pregnancy \nmay be normal; signs and chemistry may remit. Monitor glucose.\nTests \ue000Glucose, \ue000Ca\n2+, and \ue000PO4\n3\u03a9. GH: Don\u2019t rely on random GH as \nsecret ion is pulsatile and during peaks acromeg alic and normal \nlevels overlap. GH also \ue000 in: stress, sleep, puberty, and pregnancy. \nNormally GH secretion is inhibited by high glucose, and GH hardly \ndetectable. In acromegaly GH release fails to suppress.\n  \n\u2022 If basal serum GH is >0.4mcg/L (1.2mIU/L) and/or if \ue000IGF-I (p232), \nan oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed. If the lowest GH \nvalue during OGTT is above 1mcg/L (3mIU/L), acro megaly is con-\n\ufb01 rmed. With general use of very sensitive assays, it has been \nsaid that this cut-off  be decreased to 0.3mcg/L (0.9mIU/L).28 \nMethod: Collect samples for GH glucose at: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, \n150min. Possible false +ves: puberty, pregnancy, hepatic and \nrenal disease, anorexia nervosa, and DM.\n  \n\u2022 MRI scan of pituitary fossa. \u2022 Look for hypopituitarism (p232).\n  \n\u2022 Visual \ufb01 elds and acuity. \u2022 ECG, echo. Old photos if possible.\nTreatment Aim to correct (or prevent) tumour compression by \nexcising the lesion, and to reduce GH and IGF-I levels to at least a \n\u2018safe\u2019 GH level of <2mcg/L (<6mIU/L). A 3-part strategy: 1 Trans-\nsphenoidal surgery is often 1st line. 2 If surgery fails to correct \nGH/IGF-I hypersecretion, try somatostatin analogues (SSA) and/or \nradiotherapy, SSA being generally preferred. Example: octreotide \n(Sandostatin LAR\u00ae, given monthly IM), or lanreotide (Somatuline \nLA\u00ae). SE: pain at the injection site; gastrointestinal: abdominal \ncramps, \ufb02 atulence, loose stools, \ue000gallstones; impaired glucose \ntolerance. 3 The GH antagonist pegvisomant (recombinant GH ana-\nlogue) is used if resistant or intolerant to SSA. It supp resses IGF-1 \nto normal in 90%, but GH levels may rise; rarely tumour size in-\ncreases, so monitor closely. Radiotherapy: If unsuited to sur gery \nor as adjuvant; may take years to work. Follow-up: Yearly GH, IGF-\n1  \u00b1 OGTT; visual \ufb01 elds; vascular assess ment. BMI; photos (\ufb01 g 5.29).\nPrognosis May return to normal (any excess mortality is mostly \nvascular). 16% get diabetes with SSAs vs ~13% after surgery. \nFig 5.28 Acromegaly.
