He \nwent on to become a prominent academic neu-\nrologist, conducting research into the autonomic \nnervous system, which he regarded as his great-\nest achievement. Autonomic activity and running \nare, of course, intimately linked, as Bannister \nre\ufb02 ected in a more poetic manner than the usual \n\u2018\ufb01 ght or \ufb02 ight\u2019 clich\u00e9: \u2018As a child I ran barefoot \nalong damp, fresh sand by the seashore. The air \nthere had a special quality\u2026. The sound of break-\ners shut out all others, and I was startled, almost \nfrightened, by the tremendous excitement a few \nsteps could create. It was an intense moment of \ndiscovery of a source of power and beauty that \none previously hardly dreamt existed.\u2019 In 2014, \nBannister spoke publicly of his sense of irony at \nbeing diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nBettmann / Bettmann collection / Getty Images.", "text_length": 2387, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 452/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 451, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.947935", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.948711", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
