It is dependent upon the social, \ndemographic, and economic status of a country, the available healthcare system, \nand investment. It requires diagnosis and treatment to achieve parasitologic (as \nopposed to clinical) cure in order to eliminate asymptomatic transmission.\nMalaria prevention", "text_length": 3690, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 427/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 426, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.907712", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.908903", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
