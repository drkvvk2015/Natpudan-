They overlap with each other, aff ect many \norgan systems, and often require immunosuppressive therapies (p376). Consider as a \ndiff erential in unwell patients with multi-organ involvement, especially if no infection.\nSystemic sclerosis Features scleroderma (skin \ufb01 brosis), internal organ \ufb01 brosis, \nand microvascular abnormalities. Severe cases have a 40\u201350% mortality at 5 years. \n90% are ANA positive and 30\u201340% have anticentromere antibodies (see BOX). Skin dis-\nease is limited or diff use. Limited involves the face, hands, and feet (formally CREST \nsyndrome). It is associated with anticentromere antibodies in 70\u201380%. Pulmonary \nhypertension is often present subclinically, and can become rapidly life-threatening, \nso should be looked for (\ue057: sildena\ufb01 l, bosentan). Diffuse can involve the whole body. \nAntitopoisomerase-1 (SCL-70) antibodies in 40% and anti-RNA polymerase in 20%. \nPrognosis is often poor. Control BP meticulously. Perform annual echocardiogram \nand spirometry. Both limited and diff use have the potential for organ \ufb01 brosis: lung, \ncardiac, GI, and renal (p314) but this occurs later in limited sub-set.\nManagement: Currently no cure. Immunosuppressive regimens, including IV \ncyclophos phamide, are used for organ involvement or progressive skin disease. Trials \nof anti\ufb01 brotic tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing.41 Monitor BP and renal function. \nRegular ACE-i or A2RBS \ue001 risk of renal crisis (p314). Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon: (see p708).\nMixed connective tissue disease Combines features of systemic sclerosis, SLE, and \npolymyositis and the presence of high titres of anti-U1-RNP antibodies.\nRelapsing polychondritis Rare condition with recurrent episodes of cartilage in\ufb02 am-\nmation and destruction. Aff ects pinna (\ufb02 oppy ears), nasal septum, larynx (stridor), \ntracheobronchial tree (infections), and joints. Associations: Aortic valve disease, poly-\narthritis, and vasculitis. 30% have underlying rheumatic or autoimmune disease. Di-\nagnosis is clinical. \ue057: Steroids, DMARDS or CPAP/tracheostomy for airway involvement.\nPolymyositis and dermatomyositis\nRare conditions characterized by insidious onset of progressive symmetrical proxi-\nmal muscle weakness and autoimmune-mediated striated muscle in\ufb02 ammation \n(myositis), associated with myalgia \u00b1 arthralgia. Muscle weakness may also cause \ndysphagia, dysphonia (ie poor phonation, not dysphasia), or respiratory weakness. \nThe myositis (esp. in dermatomyositis) may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, com-\nmonly from lung, pancreatic, ovarian, or bowel malignancy. Screen for cancers.\nDermatomyositis Myositis plus skin signs: \u2022Macular rash (shawl sign is +ve if \nover back and shoulders). \u2022Lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids often with \noedema (\ufb01 g 12.26, p563). \u2022Nailfold erythema (dilated capillary loops). \u2022Gottron\u2019s \npapules: roughened red papules over the knuckles, also seen on elbows and knees \n(pathognomonic if \ue000CK + muscle weakness). Malignancy in 30% cases.\nExtra-muscular signs In both conditions include fever, arthralgia, Raynaud\u2019s, in-\nterstitial lung \ufb01 brosis and myocardial involvement (myocarditis, arrhythmias).\nTests Muscle enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, CK, & aldolase) \ue000 in plasma; EMG shows char-\nacteristic \ufb01 brillation potentials; muscle biopsy con\ufb01 rms diagnosis (and excludes \nmimicking conditions). MRI shows muscle oedema in acute myositis. Autoantibody \nassociations: (see BOX) anti-Mi2, anti-Jo1\u2014associated with acute onset and intersti-\ntial lung \ufb01 brosis that should be treated aggressively.\nDiff erential diagnoses Carcinomatous myopathy, inclusion-body myositis, mus-\ncular dystrophy, PMR, endocrine/metabolic myopathy (eg steroids), rhabdomyoly-\nsis, infection (eg HIV), drugs (penicillamine, colchicine, statins, or chloroquine).\nManagement Start prednisolone. Immunosuppressives (p376) and cytotoxics are \nused early in resistant  cases.
