Serum osm ol ality \nestimate \u2248 2 \u2248 (Na\n+ + K\n+) + urea + glucose (all in mmol/L). Normal plasma osmolality is \n285\u2013295mOsmol/kg, and urine can be concentrated to more than twice this concentra-\ntion. Signi\ufb01 cant DI is excluded if urine to plasma (U:P) osmolality ratio is more than 2:1, \nprovided plasma osmolality is no greater than 295mOsmol/kg. In DI, despite raised \nplasma osmolality, urine is dilute with a U:P ratio <2. In primary polydipsia there may be \ndilutional hyponatraemia\u2014and as hyponatraemia may itself cause mania, be cautious \nof saying \u2018It\u2019s water intoxication from psychogenic polydipsia\u2019.\nDiagnosis Water deprivation test: See BOX \u2018The 8-hour water deprivation test\u2019. NB: \nit is often diffi  cult to diff erentiate primary polydipsia from partial DI. \ue031\ue031: DM; diuret-\nics or lithium use; primary polydipsia causes symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria \nwith dilute urine. Its cause is poorly understood;\n19 it may be associated with schizo-\nphrenia or mania (\u00b1Li\n+ therapy), or, rarely, hypothal amic dis ease (neurosarcoid; tu-\nmour; encephalitis; brain injury; HIV encephalopathy). As part of this syndrome, the \nkidneys may lose their ability to fully concentrate urine, due to a wash-out of the \nnormal concentrating gradient in the renal medulla.\nTreatment Cranial DI: MRI (head); test anterior pituitary function (p232). Give desm-\nopressin, a synthetic analogue of ADH (eg Desmomelt\u00ae tablets).\nNephrogenic: Treat the cause. If it persists, try bendro \ufb02 umethiazide 5mg PO/24h. \nNSAIDS lower urine volume and plasma Na\n+ by inhibiting prostaglandin synthase: \nprostaglandins locally inhibit the action of ADH. \n\ue022Emergency management\n  \n\u2022 Do urgent plasma U&E, and serum and urine osmolalities. Monitor urine output \ncarefully and check U&E twice a day initially.\n  \n\u2022 IVI to keep up with urine output. If severe hypernatraemia, do not lower Na\n+ rapidly \nas this may cause cerebral oedema and brain injury. If Na\n+ is \u2265170, use 0.9% saline \ninitially\u2014this contains 150mmol/L of sodium. Aim to reduce Na\n+ at a rate of less \nthan 12mmol/L per day. Use of 0.45% saline can be dangerous.\n  \n\u2022 Desmopressin 2mcg IM (lasts 12\u201324h) may be used as a therapeutic trial.\n16 DIDMOAD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder: Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy \nand Deafness (also known as Wolfram\u2019s syndrome).\n17 Suspect neurosarcoidosis if \ue000CSF protein (seen in 34%), facial nerve palsy (25%), CSF pleocytosis (23%), \ndiabetes insipidus (21%), hemiparesis (17%), psychosis (17%), papilloedema (15%), ataxia (13%), seizures \n(12%), optic atrophy (12%), hearing loss (12%), or nystagmus (9%).\n18 Sheehan\u2019s syndrome is pituitary infarction from shock, eg postpartum haemorrhage. It is rare.\n19 Most of us could drink 20L/d and not be hyponatraemic; some get hyponatraemic drinking 5L/d; they \nmay have Psychosis, Intermittent hyponatraemia, and Polydipsia (PIP syndrome), ?from \ue000intravascular \nvolume leading to \ue000atrial natriuretic peptide, p137, hence natriuresis and hyponatraemia.", "text_length": 4364, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 248/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 247, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.432359", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.433441", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
