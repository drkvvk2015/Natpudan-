A BRCA1 mutation \nconfers a 55\u201365% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 39% risk of ovarian cancer. \nFor BRCA2, the risk of breast cancer is 45% (6% in aff ected males), and 11% for \novarian cancer. Mutations are also linked to prostate, peritoneal, and pancreatic \ncancers. TP53 mutations (somatic >inherited) also confer a risk of breast cancer.\nRefer if:\n  \n\u2022 1st-degree relative with: breast cancer <40yrs, male breast cancer, bilateral breast \ncancer <50yrs\n  \n\u2022 1st- and 2nd-degree relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer\n  \n\u2022 three 1st- or 2nd-degree relatives with breast cancer\n  \n\u2022 risk assessment calculation of >3% risk in 10yrs or lifetime risk \u226517%\n  \n\u2022 other: Ashkenazi ancestry, sarcoma <45yrs, multiple cancers at a young age.\nGenetic counselling and testing for BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 mutations is off ered if \ncalculated risk of mutation is >10%.
