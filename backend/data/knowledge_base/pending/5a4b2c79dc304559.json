However, this can be a straightforward task if you recall some \nbasic anatomy (\ufb01 gs 16.6, 16.7; table 16.2).\n\ue007If you are unsure, always ask a senior.\nTable 16.2 Radiological con\ufb01 rmation of device placement\nLine/tube/lead\nCorrect position for tip(s)\nCVC (p774)\nIn the SVC or brachiocephalic vein\nPICC \nIn the SVC or brachiocephalic vein\nTunnelled line, eg Hickman\nAt the junction of the SVC and right atrium\nEndotracheal\n3\u20137 cm above the carina (in adult)\nNasogastric (p759)\n10cm beyond the gastro-oesophageal junction\nChest drain (p766)\nIn the pleural space tracking either up (for pneumothorax) \nor down (for eff usion)\nCardiac pacemaker/tempo-\nrary pacing wire (p776) \nAtrial lead\u2014in the right appendage\nVentricular lead\u2014in the apex of the right ventricle\nNormal anatomy\n  \n\u2022 The SVC begins at the right 1st anterior intercostal space.\n  \n\u2022 The right atrium lies at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.\n  \n\u2022 The carina should be visible at the level of T5\u2013T7 thoracic vertebrae.\n  \n\u2022 The right atrial appendage sits at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.\nCommon bleeps from nursing staff \n1   Central line not aspirating:\n  \n\u2022 Is the tip in the right place (see earlier in topic) or has it gone up into the inter-\nnal jugular, too far in (sitting against the tricuspid valve, does the patient have \nan arrhythmia?) or not far enough in (sitting against a venous valve)?\n  \n\u2022 Is the tip kinked, suggesting it may be in a side vessel or against the vessel wall?\n  \n\u2022 If the line looks appropriately positioned, consider \ufb02 ushing gently, could the \nline be blocked?\n2   Patient not ventilating well:\n  \n\u2022 Is the ET tube down the right main bronchus (causes left lung collapse, or rarely \nright pneumothorax)? Retract tube to correct position (see earlier in topic).\n  \n\u2022 Is the ET tube blocked? Most have a secondary port allowing ventilation even if \nthe main hole is blocked, get anaesthetic assistance!\n3   Chest drain not bubbling/swinging:\n  \n\u2022 Is it correctly positioned (see earlier in topic)\u2014if not in the pleural space, it \ncannot drain the air/\ufb02 uid. Common problems include sitting in the soft tissue \nof the chest wall, or sitting above the eff usion, below the pneumothorax, or in \nthe oblique \ufb01 ssure.\n  \n\u2022 Is it blocked? If draining an eff usion and correctly positioned, consider gently \n\ufb02 ushing with 10mL of sterile saline, then aspirating. If not successful, obtain \nsenior advice.\n  \n\u2022 Has the eff usion/pneumothorax resolved? Pneumothoraces can rapidly resolve \nwith a correctly positioned drain.\n4   Unable to aspirate from NG tube:\n  \n\u2022 Is NG tube not far enough in/coiled in oesophagus? Tip is radio-opaque and \nshould be visible below the diaphragm, if it is coiled it may lie in the pharynx or \nanywhere along the mediastinum.\n  \n\u2022 Is NG tube passing down the trachea and into the bronchus? The oesophagus is \n(generally speaking) a straight vertical line, if the tube veers off  to left or right \nbefore it goes below the diaphragm, assume it is in the bronchus and replace it.", "text_length": 3383, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 734/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 733, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.437589", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.438477", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
