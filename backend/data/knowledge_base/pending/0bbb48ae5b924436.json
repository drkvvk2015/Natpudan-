Prolonged immersion in both may be needed.\nAsk Do not expect to \ufb01 nd apposite questions such as these in any other textbook:\n1   \u2018Have you delivered any septic babies in the last year?\u2019 Impress and cure \nyour obstetrician friends who tell you that \u2018I\u2019m so depressed about not being \nable to shake off  this \ufb02 u\u2019, and who have forgotten about transfer of brucellosis \nfrom baby to obstetrician.\n2   \u2018Are your carp well at present?\u2019 Mycobact erium marinum skin infection.\n3   \u2018Could that be a Hyalomma tick bite from when you rode your ostrich in \nlast week\u2019s race?\u2019 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.\n4   \u2018Who has been licking your face recently?\u2019 Pasteurella multocida.\n5   \u2018Has your dog been on holiday this year?\u2019 Monkeypox from prairie dogs.\n6   \u2018Has your pet hedgehog lost weight?\u2019 Salmonella.\n7   \u2018Did you develop your headache after you adopted your pet magpie?\u2019 Zo-\nonotic transmission of Cryptococcus neoformans causing meningitis.\n8   \u2018Did you have a stray pig living under your house when the monsoon\nstarted?\u2019 Pigs + standing water + mosquitoes = Japanese encephalitis.\n9   \u2018Did you sample the local frog paella?\u2019 Angiostrongyliasis causing eosino-\nphilic meningitis.\n10   \u2018Did your goat miscarry last year?\u2019 Coxiella burnetii.\n11   \u2018Did your depressed pig develop a purple snout?\u2019 Erysipelothrix rhusi-\nopathiae endocarditis via swine erysipelas.\n12   \u2018Can I see your pet lobster: he may be the cause of your bad hand?\u2019 Lob-\nsterman\u2019s hand, an erysipeloid infection from Erysipelothrix. Pet lobsters have \na grand pedigree. G\u00e9rard de Nerval used to take his \npet lobster for walks, on a blue silk lead, beside the \nSeine (\ufb01 g 9.60). A lobster, he said, is, \u2018serious-minded \nand quiet, doesn\u2019t scratch or bark like a dog, and \nknows all of the secrets of the deep\u2019. His lobster\u2019s \nmission was to combat the Philistinism chaining us \nall to mediocrity.\nAsk also, \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 Though you will not be \nabsolved of thought, even when the answer is, \u2018South-\nend\u2019. It may be a question of amnesic stopovers. Or \nperhaps your patient is an airport baggage-handler, bitten by a hitch-hiking mos-\nquito. And even when there has been no travel to the tropics, global warming is \nensuring that the tropics are travelling to us. To the \ufb01 rst writers of medical books, \nParadise was just beyond the Far East, and the world was a disc surrounded by \noceans of blue water. But the world moves on, tarnished, tawdry, and trashed; and \nParadise appears to be evolving with ever more serpents in the garden, beguiling \nus with ambiguous answers to our great questions.\nDon\u2019t give up If the culture is negative, tests may need repeating. Perhaps the \norganism is \u2018fastidious\u2019 in its nutritional requirement or requires a longer incuba-\ntion? Even if culture is achieved, it may be that the organism grown is \ufb02 ora not \npathogen. If culture fails, look for antibodies or antigen. PCR is increasingly used \nfor identi\ufb01 cation, but it is far from infallible; beware of inhibitors, contamination, \nand a primer that is not as unique as your patient.\nRemember Sherlock: \u2018My mind,\u2019 he said, \u2018rebels at stagnation. Give me prob-\nlems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most in-\ntricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then \nwith arti\ufb01 cial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for \nmental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, - \nor rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\u2019\nThe Sign of the Four, Arthur Conan Doyle, 1890.\nNo, Sherlock, you are not; you have the infectious disease physicians for company.\nEliciting the weird and the wonderful\nFig 9.60 \u2018Is your pet lobster \nwell?\u2019 (G\u00e9rard de Nerval).", "text_length": 3898, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 451/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 450, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.946300", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.947352", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
