Isomorphic red cells are similar to \ncirculating red cells and may suggest bleeding from a genitourinary or external \nsource. Dysmorphic red cells are abnormal in size/shape. Although they may in-\ndicate bleeding from the glomerulus (especially in exam questions!), assessment \nis subjective and dysmorphism also occurs due to changes in pH, osmolality, \nprotein, and due to tubular passage.\nWhite blood cells: (\ufb01 g 7.2a)\n  \n\u2022 >10 white cells/mm\n3 in an unspun specimen is abnormal.\n  \n\u2022 Causes include UTI, glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal trans-\nplant rejection, and malignancy.\nSquamous epithelial cells:\n  \n\u2022 Often seen, not pathological.\nCasts:\nCasts are cylindrical bodies formed in the lumen of distal tubules. They are formed \nof Tamm-Horsfall protein combined with cells.\n  \n\u2022 Hyaline cast (\ufb01 g 7.2b)\u2014seen in normal urine.\n  \n\u2022 Red cell cast (\ufb01 g 7.2c)\u2014signify an in\ufb02 ammatory process in the glomerulus, eg \nglomerulonephritis (p311).\n  \n\u2022 White cell cast (\ufb01 g 7.2d)\u2014pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis (p318), glomeru-\nlonephritis (p311).\n  \n\u2022 Granular cast (\ufb01 g 7.2e)\u2014formed from degenerated tubular cells, seen in any \nchronic kidney disease.\nCrystals:\nCrystals are common in old or cold urine and may not signify pathology.
