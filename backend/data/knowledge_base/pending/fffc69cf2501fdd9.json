See also lumps in the neck, p598\u2013\n600.\n1   Inspection The key questions to ask oneself when presented with a lump in the \nneck are: Is this lump thyroid related or not? What is the patient\u2019s thyroid sta-\ntus? Inspect the neck; the normal thyroid is usually neither visible nor palpable. A \nmidline swelling should raise your suspicion of thyroid pathology. Look for scars \n(eg collar incision from previous thyroid surgery). Examine the face for signs \nof hypothyroidism (puffi  ness, pallor, dry \ufb02 aky skin, xanthelasma, corneal arcus, \nbalding, loss of lateral third of eyebrow) as well as overall body habitus. Assess \nthe patient\u2019s demeanour; do they appear anxious, nervous, agitated, \ufb01 dgety (hy-\nperthyroid)? Or slow and lethargic (hypothyroid)?\n2   Swallow test Only goitres (p600), thyroglossal cysts (p598) and in some cases \nlymph nodes should move up on swallowing.\n3   Tongue protrusion test A thyroglossal cyst will move up on tongue protrusion.\n4   Palpation (By this stage of the examination if the evidence is in favour of the \nlump not rising from the thyroid it is acceptable to examine the lump like any oth-\ner (p594); assess site, size, shape, smoothness (consistency), surface (contour/\nedge/colour), and surroundings, as well as transilluminance, \ufb01 xation/tether ing, \n\ufb02 uctuance/compressibility, temperature, tenderness and whether it is pulsatile.) \nIf a thyroid mass is suspected, standing behind the patient provides an oppor-\ntunity to check for any proptosis (hyperthyroidism). Proceed to palpate each \nlobe, attempting to decide whether any lump is solitary or multiple, nodular \nor smooth/diffuse as well as site, size, etc. Repeating the swallow test while \npalpating allows you to con\ufb01 rm the early \ufb01 nding, but also attempt to \u2018get below \nthe lump\u2019. If there is a distinct inferior border under which you can place your \nhand with the entire lump above it then the goitre is unlikely to have retrosternal \nextension. Examining for \u2018spread\u2019 to the lymph nodes is particularly important \nif you suspect a thyroid malignancy (p600). Complete palpation by assessing if \nthe presence of the lump has caused the trachea to deviate from the midline.\n5   Percussion A retrosternal goitre will produce a dull percussion note when the \nsternum is percussed.\n6   Auscultation A bruit in a smooth thyroid goitre is suggestive of Graves\u2019 disease \n(p218).\nThe next stages of the exam are to examine the systemic signs of thyroid status.\n7   Hands Clubbing (\u2018thyroid acropachy\u2019) is seen in Graves\u2019 disease. Palmar erythe-\nma and a \ufb01 ne tremor are also signs of thyrotoxicosis. Assess temperature (warm \nperipheries if hyperthyroid) and the radial pulse; tachycardia and atrial \ufb01 brilla-\ntion are seen in hyperthyroidism, while bradycardia is seen in hypothyroidism.\n8   Eyes The \u2018normal\u2019 upper eyelid should always cover the upper eye such that the \nwhite sclera is not visible between the lid and the iris. In hyperthyroidism with \nexophthalmus there is proptosis as well as lid retraction and \u2018lid lag\u2019 may also be \ndetected. If the patient reports double vision when eye movements are being \ntested this indicates ophthalmoplegia of hyperthyroidism.\n9   Asking the patient to stand allows you to assess whether there is any proximal \nmyopathy (hypothyroidism). Look for pretibial myxoedema (brown swelling of \nthe lower leg above the lateral malleoli in Graves\u2019 disease). Finally, test the re\ufb02 ex-\nes; these will be slow relaxing in hypothyroidism and brisk in hyperthyroidism.\n10   Thank the patient and consider whether the lump is a goitre, and if so whether it \nis single/multiple, diff use/nodular, as well as the patient\u2019s thyroid status. Decide \non a diagnosis (p600).", "text_length": 3867, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 96/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 95, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.026603", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.027342", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
