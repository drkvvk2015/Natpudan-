It meas-\nures how far RBCS fall through a column of anticoagulated blood in 1h. If certain \nproteins cover red cells, these cause RBCS to stick to each other in columns (the same \nphenomenon as rouleaux, p328) so they fall faster.\nCauses of a raised ESR Any in\ufb02 ammation (eg infection, rheumatoid arthritis, ma-\nlignancy, myocardial infarction), anaemia, and macrocytosis.\nCaveats \u2022ESR \ue000 with age. The Westergren method is a rough guide to calculate \nthe upper limit of normal in older patients: \n\ue032: ESR=age  \u00f7  2; \ue033: ESR=(age + 10) \u00f7 2.\n\u2022Some conditions lower the ESR, eg poly-\ncythaemia (due to \ue000red cell concentration), \nmicrocytosis, and sickle-cell anaemia. Even \na slightly raised ESR in these patients should \nprompt one to ask: \u2018What else is the mat-\nter?\u2019\nManagement \u2022In those with a slightly raised ESR, the best plan is probably to wait \na month and repeat the test. \u2022If the ESR is markedly raised (>100mm/h), this can \nhave a 90% predictive value for disease, so such patients should be thoroughly in-\nvestigated, even in the presence of non-speci\ufb01 c symptoms. Take a full history, ex-\namine carefully and consider these tests: FBC, plasma electrophoresis, U&E, PSA, chest \nand abdominal imaging, \u00b1 biopsy of bone marrow or temporal artery.\nPlasma viscosity (PV)\nNormal range: 1.50\u20131.72mPa/s. In many labs, this has replaced the ESR, as it is less \naff ected by anaemia and simpler to automate. PV is aff ected by the concentration \nof large plasma proteins and \ue000 in the same conditions as the ESR\u2014both PV and ESR \n\ue000 in chronic in\ufb02 ammation and are less aff ected by acute changes (unlike CRP, p686).\nHyperviscosity syndrome\nSymptoms Lethargy; confusion; \ue001cognition; CNS disturbance; chest pain; abdom inal \npain (and sometimes spontaneous GI or GU bleeding); faints; visual disturbance (eg \n\ue001vision, amaurosis fugax, retinopathy\u2014eg engorged retinal veins, haemorrhages, \nexudates; and a blurred disc as seen in \ufb01 g 8.76). The visual symptoms are like \u2018looking \nthrough a watery car windscreen\u2019.\nCauses of high blood viscosity Very high red cell count (haematocrit >50, eg \npolycythaemia vera), white cell count (>100\u224810\n9/L, eg leukaemia), or plasma compo-\nnents\u2014usually immunoglobulins, in myeloma or Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinaemia \n(p370, as IgM is larger and so \ue000 viscosity more than the same amount of IgG). Drugs: oral \ncontraceptives, diuretics, IV IG, erythropoietin, chemotherapy, radio-contrast media.\nTreatment Urgent treatment is needed which depends on the cause. Venesec-\ntion is done in polycythaemia. Leukapheresis in leukaemias to remove white cells. \nPlasmapheresis in myeloma and Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s: blood is withdrawn via a plasma \nexchange machine, the supernatant plasma from this is discarded, and the RBCS \nreturned to the patient after being resuspended in a suitable medium.\nFig 8.76 Hyperviscosity syndrome.", "text_length": 3043, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 380/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 379, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.822232", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.823402", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
