True aneurysms are abnor mal dilatations that involve \nall layers of the arterial wall. False aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) involve a collec-\ntion of blood in the outer layer only (adventitia) which communicates with the lumen \n(eg after trauma). An eur ysms may be fusiform (eg most AAAS) or sac-like (eg Berry \naneurysms; \ufb01 g 10.17 p479).\nCauses Atheroma, trauma, infection (eg mycotic aneurysm in endocarditis; tertiary \nsyphilis\u2014especially thoracic aneurysms), connective tissue disorders (eg Marfan\u2019s, \nEhlers\u2013Danlos), in\ufb02 ammatory (eg Takayasu\u2019s aortitis, p712).\nCommon sites Aorta (infrarenal most common), iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries.\nComplications Rupture; thrombosis; embolism; \ufb01 stulae; pressure on other structures.\nScreening All \ue032 at age 65yr are invited for screening in UK, decreases mortality \nfrom ruptured AAA. \nRuptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) Death rates/year from ruptured \nAAAS rise with age: 125 per million in those aged 55\u201359; 2728 per million if over 85yrs.\nSymptoms & signs: Intermittent or continuous abdominal pain (radiates to back, iliac \nfossae, or groins; \ue007don\u2019t dismiss this as renal colic), collapse, an expansile abdominal \nmass (it expands and contracts, unlike swellings that are purely pulsatile, eg nodes \noverlying arteries), and shock. If in doubt, assume a ruptured aneurysm.\nUnruptured AAA De\ufb01 nition: >3cm across. Prevalence: 3% of those >50yrs. \ue032 : \ue033 \n>3 : 1. Less common in diabetics. Cause: Degeneration of elastic lamellae and smooth \nmuscle loss. There is a genetic component. Symptoms: Often none, they may cause \nabdominal/back pain, often discovered incidentally on abdominal examination (see \nBOX). Monitoring: RCTS have failed to demonstrate bene\ufb01 t from early endovascular \nrepair (EVAR, see later in paragraph) of aneurysms <5.5cm (where rupture rates are \nlow). Risk of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms \n>6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rup-\nture is more likely if: \u2022\ue000BP \u2022Smoker \u2022\ue033 \u2022Positive family history. Modify risk factors if \npossible at diagnosis. Elective surgery: Reserve for aneurysms \u22655.5cm or expanding \nat >1cm/yr, or symptomatic aneurysms. Operative mortality: ~5%; complications in-\nclude spinal or visceral ischaemia and distal emboli from dislodged thrombus debris. \nStudies show that age >80yrs should not, in itself, preclude surgery. Stenting (EVAR): \nMajor surgery can be avoided by inserting an endovascular stent via the femoral \nartery. EVAR has less early mortality but higher graft complications, eg failure of \nstent-graft to totally exclude blood \ufb02 ow to the aneurysm\u2014\u2018endoleak\u2019. See \ufb01 g 13.52.\nMortality\u2014treated: 41% and improving; untreated: ~100%.\n \n\ue022Summon a vascular surgeon and an experienced anaesthetist; warn theatre.\n \n\ue022Do an ECG, and take blood for amylase, Hb, crossmatch (10\u201340U may eventually \nbe needed). Catheterize the bladder.\n \n\ue022Gain IV access with 2 large-bore cannulae. Treat shock with O Rh\u03a9ve blood (if not \ncross matched), but keep systolic BP \u2264100mmHg to avoid rupturing a contained \nleak (NB: raised BP is common early on).\n \n\ue022Take the patient straight to theatre. Don\u2019t waste time on X-rays: fatal delay may \nresult, though CT can help in a stable patient with an uncertain diagnosis.\n \n\ue022Give prophylactic antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg IV.\n \n\ue022Surgery involves clamping the aorta above the leak, and inserting a Dacron\u00ae \ngraft (eg \u2018tube graft\u2019 or, if signi\ufb01 cant iliac aneurysm also, a \u2018trouser graft\u2019 with \neach \u2018leg\u2019 attached to an iliac artery).\nEmergency management of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm", "text_length": 3834, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 662/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 661, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.310998", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.311765", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
