If no clear QRS com-\nplexes, it is VF or asystole (or problems with the ECG machine or stickers).\nPrinciples of management\n\ue022If the patient is unstable or you are uncertain of what to do, get help fast\u2014the \npatient may be periarrest (p804).\n  \n\u2022 Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly.\n  \n\u2022 If in doubt, treat as ventricular tachycardia (VT)\u2014the commonest cause.\n  \n\u2022 Giving AVN blocking agents to treat SVT with aberrancy when the patient is in VT \ncan cause dangerous haemodynamic instability. Treating for VT when the patient is \nactually in SVT has less potential for deterioration.\n  \n\u2022 If WPW is suspected, avoid drugs that slow AV conduction\u2014see p114.\nDiff erential diagnosis\n  \n\u2022 Ventricular \ufb01 brillation\u2014chaotic, no pattern, \ufb01 g 3.29.\n  \n\u2022 Ventricular tachycardia (VT), \ufb01 gs 3.12, 3.30.\n  \n\u2022 Torsade de pointes (polymorphic VT)\u2014VT with varying axis (see \ufb01 g 3.31), may look \nlike VF. \ue000QT interval is a predisposing factor.\n  \n\u2022 Any cause of narrow complex tachycardias (p126) when in combination with bun-\ndle branch block or metabolic causes of broad QRS.\n  \n\u2022 Antidromic AVRT (eg WPW), p127.\nDiff erentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy This may be diffi  cult; seek expert \nhelp. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular \narrhythmia), a 12-lead ECG, and the response (or lack thereof) to certain medications. \nECG \ufb01 ndings in favour of VT:\n  \n\u2022 +ve or \u03a9ve QRS concordance in all chest leads (ie all +ve (R) or all \u03a9ve (QS)).\n  \n\u2022 QRS >160ms.\n  \n\u2022 Marked left axis deviation, or \u2018northwest axis\u2019 (QRS positive in aVR).\n  \n\u2022 AV dissociation (Ps independent of QRSs) or 2:1 or 3:1 Mobitz II heart block.\n  \n\u2022 Fusion beats or capture beats (\ufb01 gs 3.32, 3.33).\n  \n\u2022 RSR\u2019 pattern where R is taller than R\u2019. (R\u2019 taller than R suggests RBBB.)\nManagement See page 805.\nVentricular extrasystoles (ectopics) These are common and can be symptomatic\u2014\npatients describe palpitations, a thumping sensation, or their heart \u2018missing a beat\u2019. \nThe pulse may feel irregular if there are frequent ectopics. On ECG, ventricular ectop-\nics are broad QRS complexes; they may be single or occur in patterns:\n  \n\u2022 Bigeminy\u2014ectopic every other beat, see \ufb01 g 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the \nsecond QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value.\n  \n\u2022 Trigeminy\u2014every third beat is an ectopic.\n  \n\u2022 Couplet\u2014two ectopics together.\n  \n\u2022 Triplet\u2014three ectopics together.\nOccasional ventricular ectopics24 in otherwise healthy people are extremely common \nand rarely signi\ufb01 cant. Frequent ectopics (>60/hour), particularly couplets and tri-\nplets, should prompt testing for underlying cardiac conditions. Post-MI, ventricular \nectopics are associated with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias. Pay attention \nto whether the ectopics all \u2018look\u2019 the same on the ECG suggesting a single focus \n(monomorphic) or may come from multiple foci (polymorphic).
