Idiopathic (most) or in association with drugs \n(NSAIDS, lithium) or paraneoplastic (haematological malignancy, usually Hodgkin\u2019s \nlymphoma). Does not cause renal failure (if progressive CKD consider missed FSGS).\nDiagnosis: Light microscopy is normal (hence the name). Electron microscopy \nshows eff acement of podocyte foot processes.\nTreatment: Prednisolone 1mg/kg for 4\u201316 weeks. 75% of adults will respond, >50% \nrelapse. Frequent relapses are managed with \ue000 or longer-term immune suppres-\nsion (cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors).\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\nCommonest glomerulonephritis seen on renal biopsy. Primary (idiopathic) or \nsecondary (HIV, heroin, lithium, lymphoma, any cause of \ue001kidney mass/nephrons, \nkidney scarring due to another glomerulonephritis). All at risk of progressive CKD \nand kidney failure: \ue000proteinuria worsens prognosis. Disease will recur in 30\u201350% \nof kidney transplants.\nDiagnosis: Glomeruli have scarring of certain segments (ie focal sclerosis). May \nmiss early disease if <10 glomeruli in biopsy sample.\nTreatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Corticosteroids only in \nprimary (idiopathic) disease: remission in ~25%, partial remission in up to 50%. \nCalcineurin inhibitors may be considered second line. Plasma exchange and rituxi-\nmab have been used for recurrence in transplants.\nMembranous nephropathy\n~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary to:\n  \n\u2022 malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological\n  \n\u2022 infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistosomiasis\n  \n\u2022 immunological disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s\n  \n\u2022 drugs: gold, penicillamine.\nIndolent disease with spontaneous remission in ~25%.\nDiagnosis: Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody in 70\u201380% of idiopathic dis-\nease. Diff usely thickened GBM due to subepithelial deposits (IgG4 dominant in idi-\nopathic, other IgGs in secondary disease). \u2018Spikes\u2019 on silver stain.\nTreatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Immunosuppression \n(\u2018Ponticelli\u2019 regimen: corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide/chlorambucil) only \nin those at high risk of progression (proteinuria >4g without response to ACE-i/\nARB for 6 months, \ue000creatinine by 30% in 6\u201312 months but eGFR still >30). The role of \ntargeted immunosuppression in those positive for anti-phospholipase A2 receptor \nantibodies remains unknown. In secondary disease proteinuria can remit with \ntreatment of the underlying cause.\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\n~10% of adult nephrotic syndrome (higher in low- and middle-income countries \ndue to infection). Divided into:\n  \n\u2022 immune-complex associated: driven by increased or abnormal immune com-\nplexes which deposit in the kidney and activate complement. An underlying \ncause can be found in most adult cases, eg infection, cryoglobulinaemia, mono-\nclonal gammopathy, autoimmunity\n  \u2022 C3 glomerulopathy: due to a genetic or acquired defect in the alternative comple-\nment pathway, eg C3 nephritic factor. Progressive kidney dysfunction is common.\nDiagnosis: A proliferative glomerulonephritis with electron dense deposits. Im-\nmunoglobulin deposition distinguishes immune-complex-associated disease from \nC3 glomerulopathy.\nTreatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Underlying cause in im-\nmune-complex disease. Trial of immunosuppression if no underlying cause found \nand progressive decline in renal function. Treatments to block or modify C3 activa-\ntion are awaited.\nNephrotic glomerulonephritis", "text_length": 3733, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 321/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 320, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.718877", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.720249", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
