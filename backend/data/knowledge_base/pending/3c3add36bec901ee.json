It may be bright red or look like coff ee grounds. \nMelaena (Greek melas = black) means black motions, often like tar, and has a char-\nacteristic smell of altered blood. Both indicate upper GI bleeding.\nTake a brief history and \nexamine to assess severity. \nAsk about past GI bleeds; \ndyspepsia/known \nulcers; \nknown liver disease or oes-\nophageal varices (p257); \ndysphagia; \nvomiting; \nweight loss. Check drugs \n(see BOX on common and \nrare causes) and alcohol \nuse. Is there serious co-\nmorbidity (bad prognosis), \neg cardiovascular disease, \nrespiratory disease, hepatic or renal impairment, or malignancy? Look for signs \nof chronic liver disease (p276) and do a PR to check for melaena. Is the patient \nshocked? Also:\n  \u2022 Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary re\ufb01 ll time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h.\n  \u2022 \ue001GCS (tricky to assess in decompensated liver disease) or encephalopathy (p275).\n  \n\u2022 Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm).\n  \n\u2022 Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg.\n  \u2022 Calculate the Rockall score (tables 6.6, 6.7).\nAcute management (p820.) Skill in resuscitation determines survival, so get good \nat this! Summary:5 start by protecting the airway and giving high-\ufb02 ow O2, then:\n \n\ue022Insert 2 large-bore (14\u201316G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC (early Hb may be \nnormal because haemodilution has not yet taken place), U&E (\ue000urea out of propor-\ntion to creatinine indicative of massive blood meal), LFT, clotting, and crossmatch.\n \n\ue022Give IV \ufb02 uids (p821) to restore intravascular volume while waiting for cross-\nmatched blood. If haemodynamically deteriorating despite \ufb02 uid resuscitation, \ngive group O Rh\u03a9ve blood. Avoid saline if cirrhotic/varices.\n \n\ue022Insert a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.\n \n\ue022Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.\n \n\ue022Consider a CVP line to monitor and guide \ufb02 uid replacement.\n \n\ue022Transfuse (with crossmatched blood if needed) if signi\ufb01 cant Hb drop (<70g/L).\n \n\ue022Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).\n \n\ue022If suspicion of varices then give terlipressin IV eg 1\u20132mg/6h for \u22643d; relative risk \nof death \ue001 by 34%. Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotic cover.\n \n\ue022Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH2O) at least hourly until stable.\n \n\ue022Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).\n \n\ue022If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/\nembolization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, \na Sengstaken\u2013Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be \nplaced by someone with experience.\nFurther management \ue007Anatomy is important in assessing risk of rebleeding. \nPosterior DUs are highest risk as they are nearest to the gastroduodenal artery.\n  \n\u2022 Re-examine after 4h and consider the need for FFP if >4 units transfused.\n  \n\u2022 Hourly pulse, BP, CVP, urine output (4hrly if haemo dynamically stable may be OK).\n  \n\u2022 Transfuse to keep Hb >70g/L; ensure a current valid group & save sample.\n  \n\u2022 Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and clotting daily.\n  \n\u2022 Keep nil by mouth if at high rebleed risk (see BOX \u2018Management of peptic ulcer \nbleeds\u2019 and p256)\u2014ask the endoscopist.\n10 A patient with an aortic graft repair and upper GI bleeding is considered to have an aorto-enteric \ufb01 stula \nuntil proven otherwise: CT abdomen is usually required as well as endoscopy.\n11 A Dieulafoy lesion is the rupture of an unusually big arteriole, eg in the fundus of the stomach.\nCommon causes\nRare causes\n \u2022 Peptic ulcers\n \u2022 Mallory\u2013Weiss tear\n \u2022 Oesophageal varices\n \u2022 Gastritis/gastric erosions\n \u2022 Drugs (NSAIDS, aspirin, \nsteroids, thrombolytics, \nanticoagulants)\n \u2022 Oesophagitis\n \u2022 Duodenitis\n \u2022 Malignancy\n \u2022 No obvious cause\n \u2022 Bleeding disorders\n \u2022 Portal hypertensive \ngastropathy\n \u2022 Aorto-enteric \ufb01 stula\n10\n \u2022 Angiodysplasia\n \u2022 Haemobilia\n \u2022 Dieulafoy lesion\n11\n \u2022 Meckel\u2019s diverticulum\n \u2022 Peutz\u2013Jeghers\u2019 syndrome\n \u2022 Osler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu \nsyndrome.", "text_length": 4004, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 264/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 263, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.480259", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.481099", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
