Experimental: \nanti-RNA agents, immunotherapy with blood/plasma \nfrom survivors, monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp\u2122), \nEbola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV, Ebola \u00e7a suffit! trial). Ethics: \nRandomization versus compassionate use: is it ethi-\ncal to withhold even potentially bene\ufb01 cial therapy to \na control group with a life-threatening condition? Is \nobservational data gained through the compassionate \nuse of experimental therapy suffi  cient to guide clinical decisions?

Inform local infectious disease team and contact the \nImported Fever Service (0844 778 8990) for VHF investigation. \ue007Bruising, bleeding, \nand uncontrolled D&V also warrant isolation and discussion if relevant contact history.\nThis page is dedicated to Dr Sam Brisbane, director of the emergency depart-\nment in Monrovia, Liberia. Caring, light-hearted, intense, profane. In 2013, he ex-\npressed his greatest worry: an epidemic of VHF. A well-founded fear which would \nultimately prove prophetic, in a hospital with a shortage of personnel, rationing of \ngloves, and limited soap. Universal precautions? Unaff ordable, and not even close.\nHe was also a coff ee farmer. But not for him a deserved retirement to his planta-\ntion, surrounded by photographs of 8 children, 6 adopted children, and grand-\nchildren to match. Unprotected, despite a lucky fedora and a gallows sense of \nhumour, he contracted Ebola in 2014 at the age of 74 whilst manning the front line \nof the world\u2019s deadliest VHF epidemic to date. During his illness he told his doctors, \n\u2018When we \ufb01 nd ourselves in the middle of the sea and there are rough waves, we \nshould not give up. We should \ufb01 ght on to the end\u2019. A truly sagacious man whose \nlife and doctoring transcends Western perspectives. We can never replicate your \ncourage, because we will never know your fear. It is \ufb01 ttingly, the stuff  of legend. \nEbola and sacri\ufb01 ce\n  \n\u2022 Double gloves\n  \n\u2022 Fluid-repellent gown\n  \n\u2022 Full-length plastic apron\n  \n\u2022 Head cover (surgical cap)\n  \n\u2022 Fluid-repellent footwear\n  \n\u2022 Full face shield\n  \n\u2022 Full-repellent respirator\n  \n\u2022 Meticulous removal.\nEquipment", "text_length": 4024, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 435/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 434, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.921936", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.923251", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
