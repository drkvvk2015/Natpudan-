The mediastinum is rarely widened on CXR.\n  \n\u2022 Suspected leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm (p654): \ue022CT aorta.\n  \u2022 Acute kidney injury (p298): \ue022US of renal tract to exclude obstruction.\n  \n\u2022 Acute pulmonary oedema: \ue022portable CXR: don\u2019t delay to get an ideal \ufb01 lm.\n  \n\u2022 Acute abdomen with signs of peritonism: \ue022erect CXR to \ufb01 nd intraperitoneal free \ngas (\ufb01 g 13.26, p607; \u2248 GI perforation). Remember: post-op there will be detectable \ngas (air/CO2) in the abdomen for ~10 days. \ue022CT if suspicion of intra-abdominal \nsource for sepsis or pathology requiring prompt surgery (eg appendicitis) . US \nfor ectopic pregnancy.\n  \n\u2022 Any patient with post-traumatic midline cervical spine tenderness\u2014not just for \nthe emergency department! \ue022Collar and backboard immobilization followed by \na CT. All the vertebrae down to the top of T1 must be visualized and cleared before \nit is safe to take the collar off .\n  \u2022 Sudden-onset focal neurology, worst-ever headache, deteriorating GCS: \ue022CT head, \nthen LP if no evidence of \ue000ICP.\nRemember that imaging\u2014or re-imaging for a poor quality \ufb01 lm\u2014should never de-\nlay the de\ufb01 nitive treatment of an emergency condition, eg:\n  \n\u2022 Tension pneumothorax (p814 and \ufb01 g 16.43): \ue022decompression not CXR.\n  \n\u2022 Intra-abdominal haemorrhage or viscus rupture (p606): \ue022laparotomy.\n  \n\u2022 High clinical suspicion of torsion of testis (p652): \ue022surgery not Doppler US.\nPrior to the advent of interventional radiology, a collapsed, shocked patient with \nan acute abdomen would have skipped CT and gone straight for a laparotomy.\nHowever, you should bear in mind that ruptured aneurysms are increasingly being \nmanaged by endovascular repair under \ufb02 uoroscopic guidance (p654) so this is one \narea where rapid imaging may be preferable to immediate intervention.\nImaging the acutely unwell patient\nFig 16.43 This is a great educational image from ICU. The inexperienced doctor could be dis-\ntracted by the poor quality image, missing the lung bases: technicians do their best under dif-\n\ufb01 cult conditions. To ask for a new CXR here would be a mistake \ue022note the large right-sided \ntension pneumothorax needing immediate decompression! Lungs: The right lung \ufb01 eld is too \nblack compared to the left, the right hemidiaphragm is depressed, and the right lung is seen \ncollapsed against the mediastinum. Mediastinum: Left-shifted, obstructing venous return\u2014so \n\ue001cardiac output, and a threat to life. Is it being pushed or pulled? Check hila, bones, and soft tis-\nsues. Since the right lung is collapsed and mediastinum shifted to left this suggests \ue022right ten-\nsion pneumothorax. Needle thoracocentesis decompression and a chest drain are needed now.\nCourtesy of Dr Edmund Godfrey.", "text_length": 3179, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 757/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 756, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.478901", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.479883", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
