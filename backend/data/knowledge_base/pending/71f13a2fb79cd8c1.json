Haemorrhage \ncomplicates the disease course and can be life-threatening. VHF classi\ufb01 cation by viral \nsubtype is shown in table 9.22.\nTable 9.22 VHF classi\ufb01 cation (HF=haemorrhagic fever)\nVirus family Disease (virus subtype)\nDetails\nFilovirus\nEbola\nSee Ebola, this page\nMarburg\nSee Marburg, p427\nArenavirus \nLassa fever (Lassa)\nSee Lassa, p427\nArgentinian HF (Junin)\nSouth American VHF are rare causes of infec-\ntion in travellers.
