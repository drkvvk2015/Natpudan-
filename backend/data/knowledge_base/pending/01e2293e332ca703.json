This is a crude way \nof checking whether the urine contains anything that it should not, eg protein, blood, \nglucose. Abnormalities can indicate intrinsic renal disease or renal tract abnormali-\nties and usually require further investigation. However, a dipstick-positive catheter \nsample is diffi  cult to interpret.\n\ue007Look for a urine dip result (before the catheter was inserted). A positive result \nindicates the need for specialist advice from nephrology/urology. A negative result \nmay help to reassure you about the absence of intrinsic renal disease.\nProteinuria\nRequires quanti\ufb01 cation. 24h collections are rarely used due to inaccuracy. \nAlbumin:creatinine ratio (A:CR) or protein:creatinine ratio (P:CR) is performed on a \nrandom spot urine sample. Normal A:CR is <2.5(\ue032) or <3.5(\ue033). P:CR is <15. Approximate \nequivalent levels of proteinuria are given in table 7.1.\nTable 7.1 Conversion factors\nProtein excretion g/24h\nA:CR mg/mmol\nP:CR mg/mmol\n0.15 (physiological)\n2.5 \ue032 or 3.5 \ue033\n15\n0.5\n30\n50\n1\n70\n100\n3 (nephrotic range)\n250\n300\nCauses of raised A:CR/P:CR: The higher the proteinuria, the more chance it is caused \nby glomerular disease, eg glomerulonephritis, DM, amyloidosis, myeloma (though \ndipsticks do not detect light chains). Proteinuria is associated with an \ue000risk of cardio-\nvascular disease and death. False positive: Postural (repeat using an early morning \nsample), post-exercise, fever, heart failure.\nMicroalbuminuria: Ultra-sensitive dipsticks are available to measure albuminuria \n(albumin excretion 30\u2013300mg/24h). Suggests early glomerular disease, eg DM, \ue000BP.\nHaematuria\nBlood in the urine may arise from anywhere in the renal tract. Transient causes \nshould be excluded, eg UTI, menstruation. Classi\ufb01 ed as:\n  \n\u2022 visible (VH): previously known as macroscopic, frank\n  \n\u2022 non-visible (NVH): found on dipstick/microscopy, previously known as microscopic. \nNVH is subdivided according to the presence of urinary tract symptoms: sympto-\nmatic (SNVH) or asymptomatic (aNVH).\nCauses: Malignancy (kidney, ureter, bladder), calculi, IgA nephropathy, Alport syn-\ndrome (p320), other glomerulonephritis (p310), polycystic kidney disease (p320), \nschistosomiasis. Do not attribute haematuria to anticoagulation without investiga-\ntion. False positive: Myoglobin triggers same dipstick reaction\u2014check microscopy.\nManagement: VH, SNVH, and aNVH >40yr should undergo urological assessment, im-\naging, and cystoscopy to exclude renal tract malignancy and calculi.\nA renal aetiology should be considered, and renal referral made, for NVH with:\n  \n\u2022 eGFR <60\n  \n\u2022 coexistent proteinuria (A:CR >30 or P:CR >50)\n  \n\u2022 hypertension >140/90mmHg\n  \n\u2022 family history of renal disease.\nA cause is not established in 19\u201368% of patients with NVH. These patients should be \nmonitored via BP, eGFR, and repeat A:CR/P:CR every 6 months\u20131 year. Increasing pro-\nteinuria and deteriorating eGFR warrant repeat referral and investigation.\nOthers\nGlucose: DM, pregnancy, sepsis, proximal renal tubular pathology (p316). Ketones: \nStarvation, keto acidosis. Leucocytes: UTI (p296), vaginal discharge. Nitrites: UTI \n(enteric Gram\u03a9ve organism). Bilirubin: Haemolysis. Urobilinogen: Liver disease, \nhaemolysis.
