Echinocandin and lipid\nformulation of amphotericin B are preferred for\ninitial therapy in neutropenic patients. Almost all\n(>95%) C. albicans are sensitive to fluconazole.\nSome laboratories report C. albicans as \u2018\u2018C. albi\ncans complex\u2019\u2019 because of structural resemblance\nbetween albicans and dubliniensis. This is of no\nclinical significance because albicans and dubli\nniensis have same susceptibility patterns.
