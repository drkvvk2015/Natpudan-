Most importantly: \ue022 \ue000ICP (suspect if very severe headache, \n\ue001level of consciousness with falling pulse, rising BP, vomiting, focal neurology, or pap-\nilloedema)\u2014LP in these patients will cause coning, so unless it is a routine procedure, \neg for known idiopathic intracranial hypertension, obtain a CT prior to LP. CT is not \ninfallible, so be sure your indication for LP is strong.\nMethod Explain to the patient what sampling CSF entails, why it is needed, that co-\noperation is vital, and that they can communicate with you at all stages.\n  \n\u2022 Place the patient on his or her left side, with the back on the edge of the bed, fully \n\ufb02 exed (knees to chin). A pillow under the head and another between the knees may \nkeep them more stable.\n  \u2022 Landmarks: plane of iliac crests through the level of L 3/4 (see \ufb01 g 18.8). In adults, the \nspinal cord ends at the L 1/2 disc (\ufb01 g 18.9). Mark L 3/4 intervertebral space (or one \nspace below, L 4/5), eg by a gentle indentation of a needle cap on the overlying skin \n(better than a ballpoint pen mark, which might be erased by the sterilizing \ufb02 uid).\n  \n\u2022 Use aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves, gown) and 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alco-\nhol to clean the skin, allow to dry and then place sterile drapes.\n  \n\u2022 Open the spinal pack. Assemble the manometer and 3-way tap. Have three plain \nsterile tubes and one \ufb02 uoride tube (for glucose) ready.\n  \n\u2022 Using a 25G (orange) needle, raise a bleb of local anaesthetic, then use a 21G (green) \nneedle to in\ufb01 ltrate deeper.\n  \n\u2022 Wait 1min, then insert spinal needle (22G, stilette in place) perpendicular to the \nbody, through your mark, aiming slightly up towards the umbilicus. Feel resistance \nof spinal ligaments, and then the dura, then a \u2018give\u2019 as the needle enters the suba-\nrachnoid space. NB: keep the bevel of the needle facing up, parallel with dural \ufb01 bres.\n  \n\u2022 Withdraw stilette. Check CSF \ufb01 lls needle and attach manometer (3-way tap turned \noff  towards you) to measure \u2018opening\u2019 pressure.\n  \n\u2022 Catch \ufb02 uid in three sequentially numbered bottles (10 drops per tube).\n  \n\u2022 Reinsert stilette then remove needle and apply dressing. Document the procedure \nclearly in the notes including CSF appearance and opening pressure.\n  \n\u2022 Send CSF promptly for microscopy, culture, protein, lactate, and glucose (do plas-\nma glucose too)\u2014call the lab to let them know. If applicable, also send for: cytol-\nogy, fungal studies, TB culture, virology (\u00b1 herpes and other PCR), syphilis serology, \noligoclonal bands (+serum sample for comparison) if multiple sclerosis suspected. \nIs there xanthochromia (p478)?\n  \n\u2022 If you fail; ask for help\u2014try with the patient sitting or with radiological guidance.\nCSF composition Normal values: Lymphocytes <5/mm\n3; no polymorphs; protein \n<0.4g/L; glucose >2.2mmol/L (or \u226550% plasma level); pressure <200mm CSF. In men-\ningitis: See p822. In multiple sclerosis: See p496.\nBloody tap: This is an artefact due to piercing a blood vessel, which is indicated \n(unreliably) by fewer red cells in successive bottles, and no yellowing of CSF (xa n-\nthochromia). To estimate how many white cells (W) were in the CSF before the blood \nwas added, use the following:\nW = CSF WCC \u03a9 [(blood WCC \u2248 CSF RBC) \u00f7 blood RBC].\nIf the blood count is normal, the rule of thumb is to subtract from the total CSF WCC \n(per \u03bcL) one white cell for every 1000 RBCS. To estimate the true protein level, subtract \n10mg/L for every 1000 RBCS/mm\n3 (be sure to do the count and protein estimation on \nthe same bottle). NB: high protein levels in CSF make it appear yellow. Subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage: Xanthochromia (yellow supernatant on spun CSF). Red cells in equal \nnumbers in all bottles (unreliable). RBCS will excite an in\ufb02 ammatory response (eg CSF \nWCC raised), most marked after 48h. Raised protein: Meningitis; MS; Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 \nsyndrome. Very raised CSF protein: Spinal block; TB; or severe bacterial meningitis.", "text_length": 4144, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 776/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 775, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.517104", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.518119", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
