Exiled to a remote Dutch hospital during the \nNazi occupation of the Netherlands, the resourceful \ninventor assembled a junkyard construction using \na water pump from a Ford model T, an aluminium \ndrum from a downed warplane, washing machine \nparts, orange juice cans, and sausage skins. The \n\ufb01 rst 16 patients to use the machine died. Then, in \n1945, 67-year-old So\ufb01 a Maria Schafstadt (\u2018Patient \nNumber 17\u2019) was referred reluctantly to Kolff  with \n\u2018poisoning\u2019. Her blood was passed through his \nsausage-skin tube which was wrapped around the \ndrum, rotating like a washing machine in a bath of \nsalt water. A total of 80L of her blood was treated \nin this way, removing 60g of urea. After 11 hours she \nopened her eyes to declare, \u2018I\u2019m going to divorce my \nhusband\u2019. This she duly achieved, as well as making \nmedical history. Kolff  chose not to patent his life-\nsaving invention but donated copies to hospitals \nacross the world. \nWe thank Dr Andrew Mooney, our Specialist Reader, for his contribution to this chapter.", "text_length": 1700, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 300/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 299, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.688942", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.689734", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
