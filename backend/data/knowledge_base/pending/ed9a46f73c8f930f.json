With idiopathic RPF there is an associ-\nated in\ufb02 ammatory response resulting in \ufb01 brinoid necrosis of the vasa vasorum, \naff ecting the aorta and small and medium retroperitoneal vessels. The ureters get \nembedded in dense, \ufb01 brous tissue resulting in progressive bilateral ureteric ob-\nstruction. Secondary causes of RPF include malignancy, typically lymphoma.\nAssociations Drugs (eg \ue020-blockers, bromocriptine, methysergide, methyldopa), \nautoimmune disease (eg thyroiditis, SLE, ANCA+ve vasculitis), smoking, asbestos.\nTypical patient Middle-aged \ue032 with vague loin, back, or abdominal pain, \ue000BP.\nTests Blood: \ue000Urea and creatinine; \ue000ESR; \ue000CRP; anaemia. Ultrasound: Dilated ure-\nters (hydronephrosis). CT/MRI: Periaortic mass (\ufb01 g 13.50). Biopsy under imaging \nguidance is used to rule out malignancy.\nTreatment Retrograde stent placement to relieve obstruction (removed after 12 \nmonths) \u00b1 ureterolysis (dissection of the ureters from the retroperitoneal tissue). \nImmunosuppression (in idiopathic RPF) with low-dose steroids has good long-term \nresults.\nFig 13.50 CT scan of retroperitoneal \ufb01 brosis (RPF), with subsequent obstruction and dilatation of \nthe ureters (thick arrows).\nReproduced from Davison et al., Oxford Textbook of Nephrology, 2005, \nwith permission from Oxford University Press.", "text_length": 1528, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 651/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 650, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.295224", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.296138", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
