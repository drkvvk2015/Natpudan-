Worldwide distribution. ~50 000 deaths/yr, \nmost in Africa/Asia. Presentation: Incubation ~9\u201390d. Prodrome: headache, ma-\nlaise, odd behaviour, agitation, fever, paraesthesia at bite/wound site. Progresses \nto one of two disease forms:\n  \n\u2022 \u2018Furious rabies\u2019: hyperactivity and terror (hydrophobia, aerophobia)\n  \n\u2022 \u2018Paralytic rabies\u2019: \ufb02 accid paralysis in the bitten limb\ue003coma\ue003death.\nDiagnosis: Clinical: potential exposure + signs of myelitis/encephalitis (non-pro-\ngressive disease and disease >3wk are negative indicators). Viral PCR (saliva, brain, \nnerve tissue) or CSF antibodies may off er later (post-mortem) con\ufb01 rmation. Treat-\nment: If bitten, or lick to broken skin, wash (>15min) with soap and seek urgent \nhelp. Post-exposure prophylaxis: vaccination \u00b1 rabies immunoglobulin. Experimental \ntreatments: ribavirin, interferon alfa, ketamine. Preventable and elimination feasible \nwith pre-exposure vaccination of all at risk. Vaccination of dogs can \ue001 human cases.\nJapanese encephalitis virus\nFlavivirus spread by mosquitoes. Endemic transmission (~3 billion at risk) and com-\nmon cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and west Paci\ufb01 c. Severe disease is rare (1 in \n250) but leads to neurological or psychiatric sequelae in up to 50%, mortality up to \n30%. Presentation: Incubation 5\u201315d. Most asymptomatic, or mild fever and head-\nache only. Severe disease: high fever, headache, meningism, altered mental status, \ncoma, seizures, spastic paralysis, death. Diagnosis: Clinical in endemic area. Serum/\nCSF serology, PCR.7 Treatment: Supportive. Vaccination.\nWest Nile virus\nMosquito-borne \ufb02 avivirus with transmission in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, \nAustralia, and Americas. Presentation: Incubation 2\u201314d. Asymptomatic in ~80%. \nWest Nile fever in ~20%: fever, headache, N&V, lymphadenopathy. Neuroinvasive in \n~1%: encephalitis, meningitis, \ufb02 accid paralysis, mortality ~10%. Diagnosis: Serum/\nCSF IgM, viral PCR. Treatment: Supportive. Vaccine awaited (2016).\nNeurocysticercosis\nMost common helminthic disease of the CNS and most frequent cause of preventable \nepilepsy (~50% of epilepsy in endemic areas, \ufb01 g 9.46). Caused by pork tapeworm \nTaenia solium. Consumption of infected pork leads to intestinal infection (taeniasis) \nand the shedding of T. solium eggs in stool. Invasive disease occurs when the shed \neggs are ingested via faeco\u2013oral transmission. Neurocysticercosis is due to larval \ncysts infecting the CNS. Presentation: Determined by site and number of lesions \n(cysticerci) within the brain/spinal cord. Epilepsy in 70%. Focal neurology in ~20%: \nmotor/sensory loss, lan-\nguage disturbance, invol-\nuntary movements. Also \nheadache, \nvisual \nloss, \nmeningitis, \nhydrocepha-\nlus, cognitive impairment. \nDiagnosis: CT/MRI imaging \nplus serology. Treatment: \nSeizure control (\ue001evidence \non drug choice, length of \ntreatment or prophylaxis). \nNeurosurgical \nadvice \nif \nhydrocephalus/\ue000ICP. Alben-\ndazole for non-calci\ufb01 ed \nlesions (better penetration \nof CNS than praziquantel). \nBeware in\ufb02 ammatory re-\nsponse provoked by treatment\u2014 consider dexamethasone.\nFig 9.46 Endemicity (red) and suspected endemicity (orange) \nof Taenia solium 2015.\nReproduced with permission from WHO, Endemicity of Taenia solium, \n2015. \u00a9World Health Organization 2016. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/\nfactsheets/Endemicity_Taenia_Solium_2015\u20131000x706.jpg?ua=1\n7 Specialist diagnostic service and advice in UK via Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL): www.\ngov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl", "text_length": 3854, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 445/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 444, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.936975", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.937810", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
