Moderate: \u2022 Infection (eg \nEBV, endocarditis, TB, malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis). \u2022 Portal hyperten-\nsion (liver cirrhosis). \u2022 Haematological (haemolytic anaemia, leukaemia especial-\nly CML, lymphoma). \u2022 Connective tissue disease (RA, SLE). \u2022 Others: sarcoidosis, \nprimary antibody de\ufb01 ciency (OHCS p198), idiopathic.\nWhen is a mass in the left upper quadrant a spleen: (Main diff erential: en-\nlarged left kidney.) The spleen: \u2022 Is dull to percussion. \u2022 Enlarges towards the \nRIF. \u2022 Moves down on inspiration. \u2022 You may feel a medial notch. \u2022 \u2018You can\u2019t get \nabove it\u2019 (ie the top margin disappears under the ribs).\nTests: Image the spleen with abdominal USS or CT. Hunt for the cause of en-\nlargement: look for lymphadenopathy and liver disease, eg: FBC, ESR, LFT \u00b1 liver, \nmarrow, or lymph node biopsy.\nComplications: Symptoms of anaemia, infection, or bleeding can occur as a re-\nsult of hypersplenism: cells become trapped in the spleen\u2019s reticuloendothelial \nsystem causing pancytopenia. Splenectomy may be required if severe.\nSplenectomy: Main indications: splenic trauma, hypersplenism, autoimmune \nhaemolysis: in ITP (p345), warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (p338), or \ncongenital haemolytic anaemias. Mobilize early post-splenectomy as transient \n\ue000platelets predisposes to thrombi. A characteristic blood \ufb01 lm is seen following \nsplenectomy, with Howell\u2013Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and target cells \n(see p328).\n\ue007The main problem post-splenectomy is lifelong increased risk from infec-\ntion. The spleen contains macrophages which \ufb01 lter and phagocytose bacteria. \nPost-splenectomy infection is caused most commonly by encapsulated organ-\nisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus in\ufb02 uenzae, and Neisseria men-\ningitidis. Reduce this risk by giving: \n1   Immunizations:\n  \n\u2022 Pneumococcal vaccine (p167), at least 2 weeks pre-op to ensure good re-\nsponse, or as soon as possible after emergency splenectomy, eg after trau-\nma. Re-immunize every 5\u201310yrs. Avoid in pregnancy.\n  \n\u2022 Haemophilus in\ufb02 uenzae type b vaccine (Hib, see p391).\n  \n\u2022 Meningococcal vaccination course, including Men B, Men C, and Men ACWY.\n  \n\u2022 Annual in\ufb02 uenza vaccine (p396).\n2   Life-long prophylactic oral antibiotics: phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) \nor erythromycin if penicillin allergic.\n3   Pendants, bracelets, or patient-held cards to alert medical staff .\n4   Advice to seek urgent medical attention if any signs of infection: will require \nadmission for broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection develops.\n5   If travelling abroad, warn of risk of severe malaria and advise meticulous \nprophylaxis, with nets, repellent, and medication.\nThe advice given here also applies to hyposplenic patients, eg in sickle-cell anae-\nmia or coeliac disease.\nThe spleen and splenectomy", "text_length": 3265, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 381/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 380, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.824129", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.825539", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
