Today, \u2018dif\ufb01 cile\u2019 might better refer to challenges of containment.\nSigns: \ue000T\u00b0; colic; diarrhoea with systemic upset\u2014\ue000\ue000CRP, \ue000WCC, \ue001albumin, and \ncolitis (with yellow adherent plaques on in\ufb02 amed non-ulcerated mucosa\u2014the \npseudomembrane) progressing to toxic megacolon and multi-organ failure.\nAsymptomatic carriage: 2\u20135% of all adults. Only problematic with gut ecology \ndisrupted by, eg antibiotics, leading to rapid proliferation and toxin expression.\nPredictors of fulminant C. diff colitis: >70yrs, past C. diff infection; use of anti-\nperistaltic drugs; severe leucocytosis; haemodynamic instability.\nDetection: Urgent testing of suspicious stool (characteristic smell\u2014ask the \nnurses). Two-stage process with rapid screening test for C. diff protein (or PCR) \nfollowed by speci\ufb01 c ELISA for toxins. AXR for toxic megacolon.\n\ue057: Stop causative antibiotic if possible. Mild disease: metronidazole 400mg/8h PO for \n10\u201314d (vanco mycin 125mg/6h PO is better in severe disease). Intensive regimens of \nvancomycin 500mg/6h with IV and PR vancomycin may be needed for non-respond-\ners. \ue007Urgent colectomy may be needed if toxic megacolon, \ue000LDH, or if deteriorating.\nRecurrent disease: Common (\u224825%). Fidaxomicin, a minimally absorbed oral an-\ntibiotic, is associated with lower relapse rates. Faecal transplantation (introduction \nof a suspension prepared from the faeces of a screened donor via endoscopy or via \nNG/NJ tube) is a highly eff ective, if aesthetically unappealing, method of treatment.\nPreventing spread: Meticulous cleaning and appropriate bed management policies, \nuse of disposable gloves and aprons, hand-washing (not just gel\u2014kill the spores).\nClostridium dif\ufb01 cile: the cause of pseudomembranous colitis\nManaging infective diarrhoea*\nNo systemic signs\nSymptomatic \ue014\nPolymorphs seen\nParasites seen\nSpeci\ufb01 c \ue014, eg \np432\u2013435\nRoutine culture \nand microscopy.
