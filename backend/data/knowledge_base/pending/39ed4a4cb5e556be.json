Out-\ncomes may be worse after an inappropriate transfusion.\n  \n\u2022 Know and use local procedures to ensure that the right blood gets to the right \npatient at the right time.\n  \n\u2022 Take blood for crossmatching from only one patient at a time. Label immedi-\nately. This minimizes risk of wrong labelling of samples.\n  \n\u2022 When giving blood, monitor TPR and BP every \u00bdh.\n  \n\u2022 Use a dedicated line where practicable (or dedicated lumen of multilumen line).\nGroup-and-save (G&S) requests Know your local guidelines for elective surgery. \nHaving crossmatched blood to hand may not be needed if a blood sample is al-\nready in the lab, with group determined, without any atypical antibodies (ie G&S).\nProducts2 Whole blood: The only option for the \ufb01 rst 250 years of transfusion \nhistory, but now rarely used. Red cells: (Packed to make haematocrit ~70%.) Use \nto correct anaemia or blood loss. 1U \ue000Hb by 10\u201315g/L. In anaemia, transfuse until \nHb ~80g/L. Platelets: (p364.) Usually only needed if bleeding or count is <20 \u2248 10\n9/L. \n1U should \ue000platelet count by >20 \u2248 10\n9/L. Failure to do so suggests refractory cause: \ndiscuss with haematologist. If surgery is planned, get advice if count is <100 \u2248 10\n9/L. \nFresh frozen plasma (FFP): Use to correct clotting defects: eg DIC (p352); warfarin \noverdosage where vitamin K would be too slow; liver disease; thrombotic thrombo-\ncytopenic purpura (p315). It is expensive and carries all the risks of blood transfu-\nsion. Do not use as a simple volume expander. Human albumin solution is produced \nas 4.5% or 20% protein solution and is used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be \nused temporarily in the hypoprotein aemic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who \nis \ufb02 uid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load. Also used as replacement \nin abdominal paracentesis (p765). Others Cryoprecipitate (a source of \ufb01 brinogen); \ncoag ulation concentrates (self-injected in haemophilia); immunoglobulins.\nComplications of transfusion \ue007Management of acute reactions:2 see BOX \u2018Trans-\nfusion reactions\u2019 and table 8.4.\n  \n\u2022 Early (within 24h): Acute haemolytic reactions (eg ABO or Rh incompatibility); \nanaphylaxis; bacterial contamination; febrile reactions (eg from HLA antibodies); \nallergic reactions (itch, urticaria, mild fever); \ufb02 uid overload; transfusion-related \nacute lung injury (TRALI, ie ARDS due to antileucocyte antibodies in donor plasma).\n  \n\u2022 Delayed (after 24h): Infections (eg viruses: hepatitis B/C, HIV; bacteria; protozoa; \nprions); iron overload (treatment, p342); GVHD; post-transfusion purpura\u2014poten-\ntially lethal fall in platelet count 5\u20137d post-transfusion requiring specialist treat-\nment with IV immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions.\nMassive blood transfusion This is de\ufb01 ned as replacement of an individual\u2019s en-\ntire blood volume (>10U) within 24h. Complications: \ue001platelets; \ue001Ca\n2+; \ue001clotting fac-\ntors; \ue000K\n+; hypothermia. \ue007Seek early and ongoing support from haematologist and \nblood bank who should advise on products and monitoring. In acute haemorrhage, \nuse crossmatched blood if possible, but if not, use \u2018universal donor\u2019 group O Rh\u03a9ve \nblood, changing to crossmatched blood as soon as possible.\nTransfusing patients with heart failure If Hb \ue00550g/L with heart failure, trans-\nfusion with packed red cells is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60\u201380g/L, but \nmust be done with care. Give each unit over 4h with furosemide (eg 40mg slow \nIV/PO; don\u2019t mix with blood) with alternate units. Check for \ue000JVP and basal lung \ncrackles; consider CVP line.\nAutologous transfusion There is a role for patients having their own blood \nstored pre-op for later use. Erythropoietin (EPO, p304) can increase the yield of au-\ntologous blood in normal people. Intraoperative cell salvage with retransfusion is \nalso being used more often, especially in cardiac, vascular, and emergency surgery, \nCost-analysis shows that it may be worthwhile on an economic basis alone.", "text_length": 4143, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 356/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 355, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.777321", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.778121", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
