Others require resuscitation, \nPPI, antibiotics, antifungals, and surgery (debridement of mediastinum and place-\nment of T-tube for drainage and formation of a controlled oesophago-cutaneous \n\ufb01 stula).\nFundoplication for gastro-oesophageal re\ufb02 ux\nLaparoscopic fundoplication is the surgical procedure of choice when symptoms of \nGORD are refractory to medical therapy and there is severe re\ufb02 ux (con\ufb01 rmed by pH-\nmonitoring)\u2014see p254. Symptoms may be complicated by a hiatus hernia, which is \nrepaired during the procedure.\nSurgery The defect in the diaphragm is repaired by tightening the crura. Re\ufb02 ux is \nprevented by wrapping the gastric fundus around the lower oesophageal sphinc-\nter\u2014see \ufb01 g 13.39. There are various types of procedure, eg Nissen (360\u00b0 wrap), \nToupet (270\u00b0 posterior wrap), Watson (anterior hemifundoplication). Laparoscopic \nsurgery is at least as eff ective at controlling re\ufb02 ux as open surgery but with a lower \nmortality and morbidity. Wound infections and respiratory complications are also \nmore common in open surgery, though the incidence of dysphagia is similar for the \ntwo procedures\u2014but see p592.\nComplications Dysphagia (if the wrap is too tight), \u2018gas-bloat syndrome\u2019 (inability \nto belch/vomit), and new-onset diarrhoea. \nFig 13.39 Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.\nStomach\nTightened\nhiatus\nThe gastric fundus\nis wrapped around\nthe lower\noesophageal\nsphincter\nDiaphragm\nOesophagus\nLower \noesophageal \nsphincter\nStomach\nLower oesophageal \nsphincter\nSurgical instrument\nOesophagus\nOesophagus", "text_length": 2230, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 632/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 631, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.265312", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.266028", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
