After \nhis death, Gauss\u2019s brain was examined by \nanatomist Rudolph Wagner, to test the popu-\nlar theory that intellectual ability correlated \nwith physical properties of the brain such as \nweight and surface markings. While his brain \nwas noted to display an unusually intricate \npattern of sulci, lack of similarly patterned \nsulci among the brains of other intellectuals \ncast doubts on the theory. Further lack of evi-\ndence to support Wagner\u2019s hypothesis came \nwhen Gauss\u2019 brain was weighed: it would \nperhaps have amused Gauss to learn that the \nweight of his brain, whilst slightly above aver-\nage, lay very much within the central region \nof a Gaussian distribution. After some rather \nsloppy housekeeping, Gauss\u2019 brain was stored \nin a mislabelled pot at the University in G\u00f6t-\ntingen, accidentally switched with that of his \ncontemporary, the physician Conrad Fuchs. \nOver 150 years later, some careful searching \nof the archives and a MRI scanner revealed \nthe switch.", "text_length": 1472, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 758/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 757, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.480564", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.481573", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
