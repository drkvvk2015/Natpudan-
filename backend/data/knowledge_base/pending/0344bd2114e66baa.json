IO can be divided into disease-\nmodifying and symptomatic procedures.\nDisease-modifying IO:\nIntended to modify cancer progression and/or to improve prognosis. Includes:\n  \n\u2022 Image-guided ablation, eg radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, irreversible \nelectroporation.\n  \n\u2022 Embolization, eg transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, selective inter-\nnal radiation therapy.\n  \n\u2022 Image-guided brachytherapy.\n  \n\u2022 Isolated perfusion chemotherapy: uses occlusion techniques to protect normal \ntissue from high doses of chemotherapy.\nSymptomatic IO:\nProvides relief from cancer-related symptoms, but does not modify the underlying \ndisease process. The techniques (table 11.2) can off er signi\ufb01 cantly improved qual-\nity of life, reduce admissions, and increase time spent outside of hospital.\nTable 11.2 Interventional techniques available for cancer symptom control\nClinical problem\nInterventional treatment option\nAscites\nTemporary/permanent image-guided ascitic drain\nPleural eff usion\nTemporary/permanent image-guided pleural drain\nSuperior vena cava obstruc-\ntion (p528)\nSuperior vena cava stenting\nOesophageal obstruction\nOesophageal stenting\nLarge bowel obstruction\nColonic stenting\nTumour-related haemorrhage\nTransarterial embolization\nJaundice\nBiliary drainage and stenting\nRenal tract obstruction\nNephrostomy, ureteric stenting\nBone metastases\nImage-guided ablation\n\ue007Talk to your interventional radiologist.\nInterventional oncology\nMethods of delivering radiotherapy\nConventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT): Is the most common form of \ntreatment. Delivers beams of ionizing radiation to the patient from an external linear \naccelerator.\nStereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate form of EBRT used to target small \nlesions with great precision\u2014most frequently in treating intracranial tumours. It is \noften referred to by the manufacturer\u2019s name, eg Gamma Knife\u00ae, Truebeam\u00ae.\nBrachytherapy involves a radiation source being placed within or close to a tumour, \nallowing a high local radiation dose. Implants may be placed within a cavity (eg \nuterus, post-surgical space) or within tissue (eg prostate, breast).\nRadioisotope therapy uses tumour-seeking radionuclides to target speci\ufb01 c tissues. \nFor example, 131I (radioiodine) to ablate remaining thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy \nfor thyroid cancer.", "text_length": 2564, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 535/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 534, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.095899", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.096616", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
