The \nward doctor assists with a good history and examination, should anticipate nec-\nessary tests, and can also reassure and inform the patient. The surgical team \nshould consent the patient.\n\ue007The World Health Organization \u2018Surgical Safety Checklist\u2019 should be completed \nfor every patient undergoing a surgical procedure, ensuring pre-operative prepa-\nration, intra-operative monitoring, and post-operative review.\nHistory Assess past history of: MI\n1, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, rheumatic fe-\nver, epilepsy, jaundice. Existing illnesses, drugs, and allergies? Be alert to chronic \nlung disease, \ue000BP, arrhy thmias, and murmurs. Assess any speci\ufb01 c risks, eg is the \npatient pregnant? Is the neck/jaw immobile and teeth stable (intubation risk)? Has \nthere been previous anaesthesia? Were there any complications (eg nausea, DVT)?\nExamination Assess cardiorespiratory system, exercise tolerance. Is the neck \nunstable (eg arthritis complicating intubation)? \ue007Is DVT/PE prophy laxis needed \n(p578)? \ue007For \u2018unilateral\u2019 surgery, mark the correct arm/leg/kidney (surgeon).\nTests Be guided by the history and examination and local/NICE protocols.\n  \n\u2022 U&E, FBC, and \ufb01 nger-prick blood glucose in most patients. If Hb <100g/L tell \nanaesthetist. Investigate/treat as appropriate. U&E are particularly important if \nthe patient is starved, diabetic, on diuretics, a burns patient, has hepatic or renal \ndisease, has an ileus, or is parenterally fed.\n  \n\u2022 Crossmatch: Blood type is identi\ufb01 ed and units are allocated to the patient. \nGroup and save (G&S): Blood type is identi\ufb01 ed and held, pending crossmatch \n(if required). Contact your lab to discuss requirements\u2014this decreases wastage \nand allows increased effi  ciency of blood stocks.\n  \n\u2022 Speci\ufb01 c blood tests: LFT in jaundice, malignancy, or alcohol abuse. Amylase in \nacute abdominal pain. Blood glucose if diabetic (p588). Drug levels as appropri-\nate (eg digoxin, lithium). Clotting studies in liver or renal disease, DIC (p352), \nmassive blood loss, or if on valproate, warfarin, or heparin. HIV, HBsAg in high-risk \npatients, after counselling. Sickle test in those from Africa, West Indies, or Medi-\nterranean\u2014and if origins are in malarial areas (including most of India). Thyroid \nfunction tests in those with thyroid disease.\n  \n\u2022 CXR if known cardiorespiratory disease, pathology, or symptoms or >65yrs old. \nRemember to check the \ufb01 lm prior to surgery.\n  \n\u2022 ECG if >55yrs old or poor exercise tolerance, or history of myocardial ischaemia, \nhypertension, rheumatic fever, or other heart disease.\n  \n\u2022 Echocardiogram may be performed if there is a suspicion of poor LV function.\n  \n\u2022 Pulmonary function tests in known pulmonary disease/obesity.\n  \n\u2022 Lateral cervical spine X-ray (\ufb02 exion and extension views) if history of rheumatoid \narthritis/ankylosing spondylitis/Down\u2019s syndrome, to warn of diffi  cult intubations.\n  \n\u2022 MRSA screen: Screen and decolonize nasal carriers according to local policy (eg \nnasal mupirocin ointment). Colonization is not a cont ra indication to surgery. \nPlace patients last on the list to minimize transmission to others and cover with \nappropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, eg vancomycin or teicoplanin. Consider and \ndocument major blood-borne virus risk (HIV/HBV/HCV) according to local policies.\nPre-operative history, examination, and tests\nClass I \nNormally healthy patient.\nClass II \nMild systemic disease.\nClass III \nSevere systemic disease that limits activity but is not incapacitating.\nClass IV \nIncapacitating systemic disease which poses a constant threat to life.\nClass V \nMoribund: not expected to survive 24h even with operation.\nYou will see a space for an ASA number on most anaesthetic charts. It is a health. \nindex at the time of surgery. The suffi  x E is used in emergencies, eg ASA 2E.\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classi\ufb01 cation\n1 If within the last 6 months, the perioperative risk of re-infarction (up to 40%) makes most elective surgery \ntoo risky.
