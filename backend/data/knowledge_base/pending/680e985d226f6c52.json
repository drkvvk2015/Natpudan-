All patients who may be suitable for surgery \nwith curative intent should be off ered PET-CT before treatment.25 Some patients may \nundergo endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspirations for me-\ndiastinal masses. TNM staging classi\ufb01 cation for non-small cell lung cancer is shown \nin table 4.4.

Radical radio-\ntherapy for patient with stage I, II, III NSCLC. Chemotherapy \u00b1 radiotherapy for more \nadvanced disease. Regimens may be platinum based, eg with monoclonal antibodies \ntargeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (cetuximab). SCLC: consider sur-\ngery with limited stage disease. Chemotherapy \u00b1 radiotherapy if well enough. Palli-\nation: Radiotherapy is used for bronchial obstruction, SVC obstr uction, haemoptysis, \nbone pain, and cerebral metastases. SVC stent + radio therapy and dexamethasone \nfor SVC obstruction. Endo bronchial therapy: tracheal stenting, cryotherapy, laser, \nbrachytherapy (radioactive source is placed close to the tumour). Pleural drainage/\npleurodesis for symptomatic pleural eff usions. Drugs: analgesia; steroids; anti-\nemetics; cough linctus; bronchodilators; antidepressants.\nPrognosis Non-small cell: 50% 2yr survival without spread; 10% with spread. Small \ncell: median survival is 3 months if untreated; 1\u20131\u00bdyrs if treated.\nPrevention Stop smoking (p93).
