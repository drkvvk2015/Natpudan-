Is there asthma, an inhaled foreign body, a pneu-\nmothorax (p749, \ufb01 g 1) or pulmonary oedema? See p814.\nPeripheral cyanosis will occur in causes of central cyanosis, but may also be induced \nby changes in the peripheral and cutaneous vascular systems in patients with nor-\nmal oxygen saturations. It occurs in the cold, in hypovolaemia, and in arterial disease, \nand is, therefore, not a speci\ufb01 c sign.\nPallor\nMay be racial or familial\u2014or from anaemia, shock/faints, Stokes\u2013Adams attack \n(p460, pale \ufb01 rst, then \ufb02 ushing), hypothyroid ism, hypopituitarism, and albinism.\nAnaemia is haemoglobin concentration <130g/L in men and <120g/L in non-pregnant \nwomen (p324). It may be assessed from the conjunctivae and skin creases. Koilo-\nnychia and stomatitis (p32) suggest iron de\ufb01 ciency. Anaemia with jaundice suggests \nhaemolysis. \ue022If pallor just one limb or digit, think of emboli.\nSkin discolouration\nGeneralized hyperpigmentation may be genetic (racial) or due to radiation; \ue000ACTH \n(cross-reacts with melanin receptors, eg Addison\u2019s disease (p226), Nelson\u2019s syn-\ndrome (p76), ectopic ACTH in bronchial carcinoma); chronic kidney disease (\ue000urea, \np302); malabsorption; chloasma (seen in pregnancy or with the oral contraceptive \npill); biliary cirrhosis; haemochromatosis (\u2018bronzed diabetes\u2019); carotenaemia; or \ndrugs (eg chlorpromazine, busulfan, amiodarone, gold).\nObesity\nDe\ufb01 ned by the World Health Organization as a BMI of over 30kg/m\n2. A higher waist \nto hip ratio, indicating central fat distribution, is commoner in \ue032 and is associated \nwith greater health risks, which include type 2 diabetes mellitus, IHD, dyslipidaemia, \n\ue000BP, osteoarthritis of weight-bearing joints, and cancer (breast and bowel); see p206. \nThe majority of cases are not due to speci\ufb01 c metabolic disorders. Lifestyle change is \nkey to treatment, to increase energy expenditure and reduce intake (p244). Medica-\ntion \u00b1 surgery may be considered if the patient ful\ufb01 ls strict criteria (BMI of 40 kg/m\n2 \nor more, or between 35 kg/m\n2 and 40 kg/m\n2 and other signi\ufb01 cant disease that could \nimprove with weight loss, non-surgical measures have been tried and failed, patient \nreceives intensive management in a tier 3 service, and \ufb01 t for anaesthesia and sur-\ngery). Conditions associated with obesity include: genetic (Prader\u2013Willi syndrome, \nLawrence\u2013Moon syndrome), hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and hypothalamic \ndamage (eg tumour or trauma \ue003 damage to satiety regions).", "text_length": 3343, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 46/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 45, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.937254", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.937926", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
