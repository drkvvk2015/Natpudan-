Causes are usually local, such as \ntrauma,\n or entrapment (eg tumour), except for carpal tunnel syndrome (see BOX \u2018Car-\npal tunnel syndrome\u2019).\nMedian nerve C6\u2013T1 The median nerve is the nerve of precision grip\u2014muscles in-\nvolved are easier to remember if you use your \u2018LOAF\u2019 (two lumbricals, opponens pol-\nlicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis). The clinical features depend \non the location of the lesion: At the wrist: (Eg see BOX \u2018Carpal tunnel syndrome\u2019.) \nWeakness of abductor pollicis brevis and sensory loss over the radial 3\u00bd \ufb01 ngers and \npalm. Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: (Eg trauma.) Weakness of \ufb02 exion of the \ndistal phalanx of the thumb and index \ufb01 nger. Proximal lesions: (Eg compression at \nthe elbow.) May show combined defects.\nUlnar nerve C7\u2013T1 Vulnerable to elbow trauma. Signs: Weakness/wasting of \nmedial (ulnar side) wrist \ufb02 exors, interossei (cannot cross the \ufb01 ng ers in the good \nluck sign), and medial two lumbricals (claw hand, more marked in wrist lesions with \ndigitorum profundus intact); hypothenar emin ence wasting, weak 5th digit abduction, \nand 4th and 5th DIP joint \ufb02 exion; sensory loss over medial 1\u00bd \ufb01 ngers and ulnar side of \nthe hand. Treatment: see BOX \u2019Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments\u2019.\nRadial nerve C5\u2013T1 This nerve opens the \ufb01 st. It may be damaged by compression \nagainst the humerus. Signs: Test for wrist and \ufb01 nger drop with elbow \ufb02 exed and \narm pronated; sensory loss is variable\u2014the dorsal aspect of the root of the thumb \n(the anatomical snuff  box) is most reliably aff ected. Muscles involved: (\u2018BEAST\u2019) \nbrachioradialis; extensors; abductor pollicis longus; supinator; triceps.\nBrachial plexus Pain/paraesthesiae and weakness in the aff ected arm in a vari-\nable distribution. Causes: Trauma, radiotherapy (eg for breast carcinoma), pro-\nlonged wearing of a heavy rucksack, cervical rib, thoracic outlet compression (also \naff ects vasculature), or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage\u2013Turner syndrome: uni-\nlateral sudden, severe pain, followed over hours by profound weakness, resolv-\ning completely over days. May rarely involve the phrenic or lower cranial nerves.)\nPhrenic nerve C3\u20135 C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea \nwith a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR. Causes: Lung cancer, TB, paraneopl astic syn-\ndromes, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma, thoracic surgery, infec-\ntions (HZV, HIV, Lyme disease), muscular dystrophy.\nLateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh L2\u2013L3 Meralgia paraesthetica is antero-\nlateral burning thigh pain from entrapment under the inguinal ligament.\nSciatic nerve L4\u2013S3 Damaged by pelvic tumours or fractures to pelvis or femur. \nLesions aff ect the hamstrings and all muscles below the knee (foot drop), with \nloss of sensation below the knee laterally.\nCommon peroneal nerve L4\u2013S1 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. \nOften damaged as it winds round the \ufb01 bular head (trauma, sitting cross-legged). \nSigns: Foot drop, weak ankle dorsi\ufb02 exion/eversion, sensory loss over dorsal foot.\nTibial nerve L4\u2013S3 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Lesions lead \nto an inability to stand on tiptoe (plantar\ufb02 exion), invert the foot, or \ufb02 ex the toes, \nwith sensory loss over the sole.\nMononeuritis multiplex Describes the involvement of two or more peripheral \nnerves. Causes tend to be systemic: DM, connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid, \nSLE), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly Wegener\u2019s granuloma-\ntosis, PAN), and more rarely sarcoidosis, amy loid, leprosy.
