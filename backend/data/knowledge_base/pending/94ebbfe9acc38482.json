Medical therapy (p252) for peptic ulcers has made \nelective surgery exceedingly rare/redundant. \ue022Emergency surgery may be needed \nfor haemorrhage or perforation. Haemor rhage is usually treated by under-running \nthe bleeding ulcer base or excision of the ulcer. If the former is done, then a biopsy \nshould be taken to exclude malignancy. Perforation is usually managed by excision \nof the hole for histology, then closure.\nGastric carcinoma Localized disease may be treated by curative gastrectomy. Le-\nsions in the proximal third or extensive in\ufb01 ltrative disease require total gastrectomy, \nwhile lesions in the distal two-thirds can be treated with a partial gastrectomy. Lapa-\nroscopic surgery may be as eff ective and safe as open surgery in specialist centres. \nSurgery: Billroth I: Partial gastrectomy with simple gastroduodenal re-anastomosis.\nBillroth II (AKA Polya) gastrectomy: (\ufb01 g 13.37) Partial gastrectomy with gastroje-\njunal anastomosis. The duodenal stump is oversewn (leaving a blind aff erent loop), \nand anastomosis is achieved by a longitud inal incision into the proximal jejunum. \nRoux-en-Y: (\ufb01 g 13.38) Following total or subtotal gastrectomy, the proximal duodenal \nstump is oversewn, the proximal jejunum is divided from the distal duodenum and con-\nnects with the oesophagus (or proximal stomach after subtotal gastrectomy), while \nthe distal duodenum is connected to the distal jejunum.\nLymph node clearance is a controversial area. RCTS and meta-analyses suggest there \nmay be limited bene\ufb01 t and increased morbidity associated with extended lymph \nnode resections (D2 or D3) over resection limited to the perigastric nodes (D1).\nPhysical complications of gastrectomy\n  \n\u2022 Abdominal fullness: Feeling of early satiety (\u00b1 discomfort and distension) im-\nproving with time. Advise to take small, frequent meals.\n  \n\u2022 Afferent loop syndrome: Post-gastrectomy (eg Billroth II), the aff erent loop \nmay \ufb01 ll with bile after a meal, causing upper abdominal pain and bilious vomit-\ning. This is diffi  cult to treat\u2014but often improves with time.\n  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea: May be disabling after vagotomy. Codeine phosphate may help.\n  \n\u2022 Gastric tumour: A rare complication of any surgery which \ue001 acid production.\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Amylase: If with abdominal pain, this may indicate aff erent loop obstruction \nafter Billroth II surgery and requires emergency surgery.\nMetabolic complications\n  \n\u2022 Dumping syndrome: Fainting and sweating after eating due to food of high os-\nmotic potential being dumped in the jejunum, causing oligaemia from rapid \ufb02 uid \nshifts. \u2018Late dumping\u2019 is due to rebound hypoglycaemia and occurs 1\u20133h after \nmeals. Both tend to improve with time but may be helped by eating less sugar, \nand more guar gum and pectin (slows glucose absorption). Acarbose may also \nhelp to reduce the early hyperglycaemic stimulus to insulin secretion.\n  \n\u2022 Weight loss: Often due to poor calorie intake.\n  \n\u2022 Bacterial overgrowth \u00b1 malabsorption (blind loop syndrome) may occur.\n  \n\u2022 Anaemia: Usually from lack of iron, hypochlorhydria, and stomach resection. B12 \nlevels are frequently low but megaloblastic anaemia is rare.\n  \n\u2022 Osteomalacia: There may be pseudofractures which look like metastases.", "text_length": 3433, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 630/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 629, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.262641", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.263297", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
