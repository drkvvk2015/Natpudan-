Phase II data have shown\nthat these tumors are particularly sensitive to plati\nnum based chemotherapy and poly(ADP ribose) poly\nmerase (PARP) inhibitors due to defects in DNA homo\nlogous recombination repair from BRCA mutation\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nRATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION SERIES:\nDOES THIS PATIENT HAVE BREAST CANCER?\nPHYSICAL\nthe value of inspection is unproved.
