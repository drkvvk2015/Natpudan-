So many GI \ninvestigations are indirect...now is your chance for direct observation.\nLeucoplakia (\ufb01 g 6.2) Is an oral mucosal white patch that will not rub off  and is \nnot attributable to any other known disease. It is a premalignant lesion, with a \ntransformation rate, which ranges from 0.6% to 18%. Oral hairy leucoplakia is a \nshaggy white patch on the side of the tongue seen in HIV, caused by EBV. \ue007When \nin doubt, refer all intra-oral white lesions (see BOX).\nAphthous ulcers (\ufb01 g 6.3) 20% of us get these shallow, painful ulcers on the \ntongue or oral mucosa that heal without scarring. Causes of severe ulcers: \nCrohn\u2019s and coeliac disease; Beh\u00e7et\u2019s (p694); trauma; erythema multiforme; lichen \nplanus; pemphigus; pemphigoid; infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, Vincent\u2019s \nangina, p712). \ue057: Minor ulcers: avoid oral trauma (eg hard toothbrushes or foods \nsuch as toast) and acidic foods or drinks. Tetracycline or antimicrobial mouth-\nwashes (eg chlorhexidine) with topical steroids (eg triamcinolone gel) and topical \nanalgesia. Severe ulcers: possible therapies include systemic corticosteroids (eg \noral prednisolone 30\u201360mg/d PO for a week) or thalidomide (absolutely contraindi-\ncated in pregnancy). \ue007Biopsy any ulcer not healing after 3 weeks to exclude mal-\nignancy; refer to an oral surgeon if uncertain.\nCandidiasis (thrush) (\ufb01 g 6.4) Causes white patches or erythema of the buccal mu-\ncosa. Patches may be hard to remove and bleed if scraped. Risk factors: Extremes \nof age; DM; antibiotics; immunosuppression (long-term corticosteroids, including in-\nhalers; cytotoxics; malignancy; HIV). \ue057: Nystatin suspension 400 000U (4mL swill and \nswallow/6h). Fluconazole for oropharyngeal thrush.\nCheilitis (angular stomatitis) Fissuring of the mouth\u2019s corners is caused by denture \nproblems, candidiasis, or de\ufb01 ciency of iron or ribo\ufb02 avin (vitamin B2). (\ufb01 g 8.5, p327.)\nGingivitis Gum in\ufb02 ammation \u00b1 hypertrophy occurs with poor oral hygiene, drugs \n(phenytoin, ciclosporin, nifedipine), pregnancy, vitamin C de\ufb01 ciency (scurvy, p268), \nacute myeloid leukaemia (p356), or Vincent\u2019s angina (p712).\nMicrostomia (\ufb01 g 6.5) The mouth is too small, eg from thickening and tightening \nof the perioral skin after burns or in epidermolysis bullosa (destructive skin and \nmucous membrane blisters \u00b1 ankyloglossia) or systemic sclerosis (p552).\nOral pigmentation Perioral brown spots characterize Peutz\u2013Jeghers\u2019 (p708). Pig-\nmentation anywhere in the mouth suggests Addison\u2019s disease (p226) or drugs (eg \nanti malarials). Consider malignant melanoma. Telangiectasia: Systemic sclerosis; \nOsler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu syndrome (p708). Fordyce glands: (Creamy yellow spots at \nthe border of the oral mucosa and the lip vermilion.) Sebaceous cysts, common \nand benign. Aspergillus niger colonization may cause a black tongue.\nTeeth (\ufb01 g 6.6) A blue line at the gum\u2013tooth margin suggests lead poisoning. Pre-\nnatal or childhood tetracycline exposure causes a yellow\u2013brown discolouration.\nTongue This may be furred or dry (xerostomia) in dehydration, drug therapy,\n3 after \nradiotherapy, in Crohn\u2019s disease, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s (p710), and Mikulicz\u2019s syndrome (p706).\nGlossitis: Means a smooth, red, sore tongue, eg caused by iron, folate, or B12 de\ufb01 -\nciency (\ufb01 g 8.27, p335). If local loss of papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that change \nin colour and size, use the term geographic tongue (harmless migratory glossitis).\nMacroglossia: The tongue is too big. Causes: myxoedema; acromegaly; amyloid \n(p370). A ranula is a bluish salivary retention cyst to one side of the frenulum, \nnamed after the bulging vocal pouch of frogs\u2019 throats (genus Rana).\nTongue cancer: Appears as a raised ulcer with \ufb01 rm edges. Risk factors: smoking, \nalcohol.\n4 Spread: anterior \u2153 of tongue drains to submental nodes; middle \u2153 to sub-\nmandibular nodes; posterior \u2153 to deep cervical nodes (see BOX, p599). Treatment: \nRadiotherapy or surgery. 5yr survival (early disease): 80%. \ue007When in doubt, refer.\n3 Drugs causing xerostomia: ACE-i; antidepressants; antihistamines; antipsychotics; antimuscarinics/\nanti cholinergics; bromocriptine; diuretics; lo peramide; nifedipine; opiates; prazosin; prochlorperazine, etc.\n4 Betel nut (Areca catechu) chewing, common in South Asia, may be an independent risk factor.", "text_length": 4444, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 254/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 253, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.454240", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.454930", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
