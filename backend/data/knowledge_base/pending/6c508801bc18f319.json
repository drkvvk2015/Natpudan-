Percuss all regions of abdomen. If \nthis induces pain, there may be peritoneal in\ufb02 ammation below (eg an in\ufb02 amed ap-\npendix). Some experts percuss \ufb01 rst, before palpation, because even anxious patients \ndo not expect this to hurt\u2014so, if it does hurt, this is a very valuable sign. Percuss for \nthe shifting dullness of ascites (p61 & p604) but ultrasound is a more reliable way of \ndetecting ascites.\nAuscultation\nBowel sounds: absence implies ileus; they are enhanced and tink ling in bowel ob-\nstruction. Listen for bruits in the aorta, renal and femoral arteries.\nFurther examination Check for hernias (p612), perform a PR examination see BOX \n\u2018Examination of the rectum and anus\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 Cannot get above it (ribs overlie the upper border of the spleen).\n  \n\u2022 Dull to percussion (kidney is usually resonant because of overlying bowel).\n  \n\u2022 Moves towards RIF with inspiration (kidney tends to move downwards).\n  \n\u2022 May have palpable notch on its medial side.\nFeatures of the spleen diff erentiating it from an enlarged kidney\n(For hepatosplenomegaly, see p604.)\nMalignancy: Metastatic or primary (usually craggy, irregular edge).\nHepatic congestion: Right heart failure\u2014may be pulsatile in tricuspid incompe-\ntence, hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome, p696).\nAnatomical: Riedel\u2019s lobe (normal variant).\nInfection: Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis viruses, malaria, \nschistosomiasis, amoebic abscess, hydatid cyst.\nHaematological: Leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders (eg my-\nelo\ufb01 brosis), sickle-cell disease, haemolytic anaemias.\nOthers: Fatty liver, porphyria, amyloidosis, glycogen storage disorders.\nSplenomegaly\n  \n\u2022 Abnormally large spleen.\nCauses: See p604. If massive, think of: chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelo\ufb01 brosis, \nmalaria (or leishmaniasis).\nCauses of hepatomegaly\n\ue007It is necessary to have a chaperone present for the examination. Explain what \nyou are about to do. Make sure curtains are pulled. Have the patient lie on their \nleft side, with knees brought up towards the chest. Use gloves and lubricant. Part \nthe buttocks and inspect the anus: \u2022A gaping anus suggests a neuropathy or \nmegarectum. \u2022Symmetry (a tender unilateral bulge suggests an abscess). \u2022Pro-\nlapsed piles. \u2022A subanodermal clot may peep out. \u2022Prolapsed rectum (descent of \n>3cm when asked to strain, as if to pass a motion). \u2022Anodermatitis (from frequent \nsoiling). The anocutaneous re\ufb02 ex tests sensory and motor innervation\u2014on lightly \nstroking the anal skin, does the external sphincter brie\ufb02 y contract?\nPress your index \ufb01 nger against the side of the anus. Ask the patient to \nbreathe deeply and insert your \ufb01 nger slowly. Feel for masses (haemorrhoids are not \npalpable) or impacted stool. Twist your arm so that the pad of your \ufb01 nger is feeling \nanteriorly. Feel for the cervix or prostate. Note consistency, size, and symmetry of \nthe prostate. If there is faecal incontinence or concern about the spinal cord, ask the \npatient to squeeze your \ufb01 nger and note the tone. This is best done with your \ufb01 nger \npad facing posteriorly. Note stool or blood on the glove and test for occult blood.\nWipe the anus. Consider proctoscopy (for the anus) or sigmoidoscopy (which \nmainly inspects the rectum).\nExamination of the rectum and anus", "text_length": 3521, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 75/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 74, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.992256", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.992972", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
