Inner (transitional) zone enlarges in contrast to peripheral lay-\ner expansion seen in prostate carcinoma. Features: Lower urinary tract symptoms \n(LUTS) = nocturia, frequency, urgency, post-micturition dribbling, poor stream/\ufb02 ow, \nhesitancy, over\ufb02 ow incontinence, haematuria, bladder stones, UTI. Management: \nAssess severity of symptoms and impact on life. PR exam. Tests: MSU; U&E; ultrasound \n(large residual volume, hydronephrosis\u2014\ufb01 g 13.49), PSA (prior to PR exam; see also BOX \n\u2018Advice to asymptomatic men\u2019, p645),\n transrectal US \u00b1 biopsy. Then consider:\n  \n\u2022 Lifestyle: Avoid caff eine, alcohol (to \ue001urgency/nocturia). Relax when voiding. Void \ntwice in a row to aid emptying. Control urgency by prac tising distraction methods \n(eg breathing exercises). Train the bladder by \u2018holding on\u2019 to \ue000 time between voiding.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs are useful in mild disease, and while awaiting surgery. \u2022 \ue025-blockers are 1st \nline (eg tamsulosin 400mcg/d PO; also alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin). \ue001Smooth \nmuscle tone (prostate and bladder). SE: drowsiness; depression; dizziness; \ue001BP; \ndry mouth; ejaculatory failure; extra-pyramidal signs; nasal congestion; \ue000weight. \n\u2022 5\ue025-reductase inhibitors: can be added, or used alone, eg \ufb01 nasteride 5mg/d PO \n(\ue001conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone). \nExcreted in semen, so use condoms; females should avoid handling. SE: impotence; \n\ue001libido. \ue001prostate size over 3\u20136mths and \ue001 long-term retention risk.\n  \n\u2022 Surgery:\n  \u2022 Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) \u226414% become impotent (see BOX). \nCrossmatch 2U. Beware bleeding, clot retention, and post TURP syndrome: absorp-\ntion of washout causing CNS & CVS disturbance. ~12% need redoing within 8yrs.\n  \n\u2022 Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) involves less destruction than \nTURP, and less risk to sexual function, gives similar bene\ufb01 t. Relieves pressure \non the urethra. Maybe best surgical option for those with small glands <30g.\n  \n\u2022 Retropubic prostatectomy is an open operation (if prostate very large).\n  \n\u2022 Transurethral laser-induced prostatectomy (TULIP) may be as good as TURP.\n  \n\u2022 Robotic prostatectomy is gaining popularity as a less traumatic and minimally \ninvasive treatment option.\nPre-op consent issues may centre on risks of the procedure, eg:\n  \n\u2022 Haematuria/haemorrhage\n  \n\u2022 Infection; prostatitis\n  \n\u2022 Haematospermia\n  \n\u2022 Erectile dysfunction ~10%\n  \n\u2022 Hypothermia\n  \n\u2022 Incontinence \u226410%\n  \n\u2022 Urethral trauma/stricture\n  \n\u2022 Clot retention near strictures\n  \n\u2022 Post TURP syndrome (\ue001T\u00b0; \ue001Na\n+)\n  \n\u2022 Retrograde ejaculation (common).\nPost\u2013operative advice\n  \n\u2022 Avoid driving for 2wks after the operation.\n  \n\u2022 Avoid sex for 2wks after surgery. Then get back to normal. The amount ejacu-\nlated may be reduced (as it \ufb02 ows backwards into the bladder\u2014harmless, but \nmay cloud the urine). It means you may be infertile. Erections may be a problem \nafter TURP, but do not expect this: in some men, erections improve. Rarely, orgas-\nmic sensations are reduced.\n  \n\u2022 Expect to pass blood in the urine for the \ufb01 rst 2wks. A small amount of blood \ncolours the urine bright red. Do not be alarmed.\n  \n\u2022 At \ufb01 rst you may need to urinate more frequently than before. Do not be de-\nspondent. In 6wks things should be much better\u2014but the operation cannot be \nguaranteed to work (8% fail, and lasting incontinence is a problem in 6%; 12% \nmay need repeat TURPS within 8yrs, compared with 1.8% of men undergoing open \nprostatectomy).\n  \n\u2022 If feverish, or if urination hurts, take a sample of urine to your doctor.\nAdvice for patients concerning transurethral prostatectomy (TURP)", "text_length": 3916, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 650/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 649, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.293973", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.294701", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
