This creates tensions for training, but these are not \ninsurmountable. Seek out opportunities to learn practical procedures, ideally in a \ncontrolled, elective setting, so that your \ufb01 rst attempt isn\u2019t a life-or-death emergency \nattempt\u2014time spent in theatres or ICU will pay dividends in this regard. Many sen-\niors will be happy to make time to teach if you contact them in advance\u2014let them \nknow you are interested and leave your bleep. \ue007Even in an emergency setting, it is \nstill wiser to seek help rather than attempting an urgent procedure for the \ufb01 rst time.\nTraining and the business of medicine\nFig 18.1 NHS \u2018clean your hands\u2019 campaign poster.\nContains public sector information licensed under Open \nGovernment Licence v3.0. https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/\nrequest/21861/response/56086/attach/3/04072%20Hand%20\nHygiene%205%201.1.pdf\nHungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated the bene\ufb01 ts of handwash-\ning in the 1840s: he observed that maternal mortality was nearly three times as high \non a doctor-run maternity ward compared to a midwife-run ward. The explanation \nremained elusive until Semmelweis\u2019 friend Jakob Kolletschka died after receiving an \naccidental scalpel cut from a student during a post-mortem demonstration. Sem-\nmelweis recognized in Kolletschka\u2019s death many of the features of the dying moth-\ners. The explanation: the maternity ward doctors\u2019 day started with post-mortem \nexaminations, from which they would procede to perform vaginal examinations on \nthe living without washing their hands. Noticing this, Semmelweis introduced the \npractice of washing hands with chloride of lime and cut death rates to that of the \nmidwives\u2019 patients. Despite the evidence he amassed, Semmelweis\u2019s theory was \nrejected by his contemporaries, a rejection which undoubtedly contributed to his \npsychiatric distress, eventual commitment to an asylum, and ultimate death from \nthe blows of his guards. It would take another 20 years and countless deaths before \nLister published his landmark work on the use of carbolic acid in surgery.\nTake a minute to wash your hands thoroughly before undertaking any procedure. This \nprerequisite will not only reduce infection risk for your patients, but give you a moment \nfor mindfulness: focus on the hot water running over your hands, breathe deeply, and \nfor a while forget about your list of jobs. Perhaps spare Dr Kolletschka a thought. You \nmay \ufb01 nd that the subsequent procedure goes more smoothly than anticipated.", "text_length": 3499, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 766/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 765, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.495075", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.495960", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
