Unfortu-\nnately, as with Los\u2019 task, ours is one with an eternity \nof duties within and external to it. Rather than be-\ncoming overwhelmed by a seemingly endless job list, \nwe must take our focus from the single red cell to the \nsurrounding interconnected systems; by prioritizing \nour tasks and asking for help when we need it, we \nmight not face such a solitary and interminable fate.\n\u00a9 Wikimedia/ Library of Congress", "text_length": 2350, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 330/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 329, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.735908", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.736665", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
