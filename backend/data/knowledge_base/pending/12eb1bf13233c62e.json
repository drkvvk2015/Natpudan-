They can have multiple manifestations:\nTremor Note frequency, amplitude, and exacerbating factors (stress; fatigue).\n  \n\u2022 Rest tremor: Abolished on voluntary movement. Cause: parkinsonism (p494).\n  \u2022 Intention tremor: Irregular, large-amplitude, worse at the end of purposeful acts, eg \n\ufb01 nger-pointing or using a remote control. Cause: cerebellar damage (eg MS, stroke).\n  \u2022 Postural tremor: Absent at rest, present on maintained posture (arms out stretched) \nand may persist (but is not worse) on movement. Causes: benign essential tremor \n(autosomal dominant; improves with alcohol), thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, \ue020-agonists.\n  \n\u2022 Re-emergent tremor: Postural tremor developing after a delay of ~10s. Causes: \nParkinson\u2019s disease (don\u2019t mistake for essential tremor).\nChorea Non-rhythmic, jerky, purposeless movements \ufb02 itting from one place to \nanother\u2014eg facial grimacing, raising the shoulders, \ufb02 exing/extending the \ufb01 ngers. \nCauses: Huntington\u2019s disease, Syden ham\u2019s chorea (rare complication of group A \nstreptococcal infection). Worsened by levodopa.\nHemiballismus Large-amplitude, \ufb02 inging hemichorea (aff ects proximal muscles) \ncontralateral to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (often elderly diabet-\nics). Recovers spontaneously over months.\nAthetosis Slow, sinuous, con\ufb02 uent, purposeless movements (especially digits, \nhands, face, tongue), often diffi  cult to distinguish from chorea. Causes: Common-\nest is cerebral palsy (OHCS p214). Most other \u2018athetoid\u2019 patterns may now be better \nclassed as dystonias. Pseudoathetosis: Caused by severe proprioceptive loss.\nTics Brief, repeated, stereotyped movements which patients may suppress for a \nwhile. Tics are common in children (and usually resolve). In Tourette\u2019s syndrome \n(p700), motor and vocal tics occur. Consider psychological support, clonazepam or \nclonidine if tics are severe (haloperidol may help but risks tardive dyskinesia).\nMyoclonus Sudden involuntary focal or general jerks arising from cord, brainstem, \nor cerebral cortex, seen in metabolic problems, neurodegenerative disease (eg lysoso-\nmal storage enzyme defects), CJD (p696), and myoclonic epilepsies (infantile spasms). \nBenign essential myoclonus: Childhood onset with frequent generalized myoclonus, \nwithout progression. Often autosomal dominant. It may respond to valproate, \nclonazepam, or piracetam. Asterixis (\u2018metabolic \ufb02 ap\u2019): Jerking (~1\u20132 jerks/sec) of \noutstretched hands, worse with wrists extended, from loss of extensor tone\u2014ie inco-\nordination between \ufb02 exors and extensors (=\u2018negative myoclonus\u2019). Causes: Liver or \nkidney failure, \ue001Na\n+, \ue000CO2, gabapentin, thalamic stroke (consider if unilateral).\nTardive syndromes Delayed onset yet potentially irreversible symptoms oc-\ncuring after chronic exposure to dopamine antagonists (eg antipsychotics, an-\ntiemetics). Classi\ufb01 cation: \u2022Tardive dyskinesia: orobuccolingual, truncal, or \nchoreiform movements, eg vacuous chewing and grimacing movements. \u2022Tardive \ndystonia: sustained, stereotyped muscle spasms of a twisting or turning charac-\nter, eg retrocollis and back arching/opisthotonic posturing. \u2022Tardive akathisia: \nsense of restlessness or unease \u00b1 repetitive, purposeless movements (stereotyp-\nies, eg pacing). \u2022Tardive myoclonus. \u2022Tardive tourettism (p700). \u2022Tardive tremor. \nTreating tardive dyskinesia: Gradually withdraw neuroleptics and wait 3\u20136 months. \nTetrabenazine may help. Quetiapine, olanzapine, and clozapine are examples of atyp-\nical antipsychotics that are less likely to cause tardive syndromes.", "text_length": 3750, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 476/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 475, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.988831", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.989508", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
