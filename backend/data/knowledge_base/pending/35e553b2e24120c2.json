Don\u2019t be surprised to \nbe called by the biochemistry lab to \nbe told that the serum creatinine is \n1000\u03bcmol/L! The good news is that \nrenal fun ction usually returns to \nbaseline after a few days (there may \nbe mild background impairment). \nAsk for an urgent renal US (\ufb01 g 13.49) \nand con sider the following in the \nacute plan to ensure a safe course:\n  \n\u2022 Hyperkalaemia See p301.\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic acidosis On ABG there \nis likely to be a respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis. Concerns should \nprompt discussion with a renal specialist (a good idea anyway), in case haemo-\ndialysis is required (p306).\n  \n\u2022 Post-obstructive diuresis In the acute phase after relief of the obstruction, the \nkidneys produce a lot of urine\u2014as much as a litre in the \ufb01 rst hour. It is vital to \nprovide resuscitation \ufb02 uids and then match input with output. \ue007Fluid depletion \nrather than overload is the danger here.\n  \n\u2022 Sodium- and bicarbonate\u2013losing nephropathy As the kidney undergoes diu-\nresis, Na\n+ and bicarbonate are lost in the urine in large quantities. Replace \u2018in for \nout\u2019 (as mentioned above) with isotonic 1 . 26% sodium bicarbonate solution\u2014this \nshould be available from ITU. Some advocate using 0.9% saline, though the chlo-\nride load may exacerbate acidosis. Withhold any nephrotoxic drugs.\n  \n\u2022 Infection Treat infection, bearing in mind that the \ue000WCC and \ue000CRP may be part of \nthe stress response.
