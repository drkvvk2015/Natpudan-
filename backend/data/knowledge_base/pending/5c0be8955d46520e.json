Note skin involvement; ulceration, dimpling (peau \nd\u2019orange), and nipple inversion/discharge.\n2   Palpation of the breast Con\ufb01 rm size, and shape of any lump. Is it \ufb01 xed/teth-\nered to skin or underlying structures (see BOX 2 \u2018Palpation\u2019)? Is it \ufb02 uctuant/com-\npressible/hard? Temperature? Tender? Mobile (more likely to be \ufb01 broadenoma)?\n3   Palpation of the axilla for lymph nodes Metastatic spread? Ipsilateral/bilat-\neral? Matted? Fixed?\n4   Further examination Examine abdomen for hepatomegaly, spine for tender-\nness, lungs (metastatic spread).\n1 General inspection\n\ue007Always have a chaperone present when examining the breast.\nIntroduction, consent, position patient sitting at edge of bed with hands by her \nside, expose to waist. Inspect both breasts for obvious masses, contour anomalies, \nasymmetry, scars, ulceration, skin changes, eg peau d\u2019orange (orange peel appear-\nance resulting from oedema). Look for nipple inversion and nipple discharge. Ask \nher to \u2018press hands on hips\u2019 and then \u2018hands on head\u2019 to accentuate any asymmetri-\ncal changes. While patient has her hands raised inspect axillae for any masses as \nwell as inspecting under the breasts.\n2 Palpation of the breast\nPosition patient sitting back at 45\u00b0 with hand \nbehind head (ie right hand behind head when \nexamining the right breast\u2014see \ufb01 g 2.50). Ask \npatient if she has any pain or discharge. Exam-\nine painful areas last and then ask her to ex-\npress any discharge. Examine each breast with \nthe \u2018normal\u2019 side \ufb01 rst. Examine each quadrant \nin turn as well as the axillary tail of Spence (\ufb01 g \n2.51) or use a concentric spiral method (\ufb01 g 2.52) \nusing a \ufb02 at hand to roll breast against underly-\ning chest wall. De\ufb01 ne any lumps/lumpy areas. \nIf you discover a lump, to examine for \ufb01 xity to \nthe pectoral muscles ask the patient to push \nagainst your hand with her arm outstretched.\n3 Palpation of the axilla\nExamine both axillae. When examining right \naxilla, hold the patient\u2019s right arm with your \nright hand and examine axilla with left hand.\nFive sets of axillary nodes:\ni) apical (palpate against glenohumeral joint)\nii) anterior (palpate against pectoralis major)\niii) central (palpate against lateral chest wall)\niv) posterior (palpate against latissimus dorsi)\nv) medial (palpate against humerus).\n4 Further examination\nComplete examination by palpating down \nspine for tenderness, examining abdomen for \nhepatomegaly, and lungs for signs of metasta-\nses. Thank patient and wash hands.\nFig 2.52 Methods for systematic breast \npalpation.\nReproduced from Thomas J, et al.
