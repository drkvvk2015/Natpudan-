A drug in an apparently too \nlow concentration may still be clinically useful, while some patients require (and \ntolerate) levels in the \u2018toxic\u2019 range.\n\ue007The time since the last dose should be speci\ufb01 ed on the request form.\nAmikacin.\n1 Peak (1h post IV dose): 20\u201330mg/L. Trough: <10mg/L.\nCarbamazepine.\n1 Optimal concentration: 20\u201350\u03bcmol/L (4\u201312mg/L).\nDigoxin\n1 (6\u201312h post dose) 1\u20132.6nmol/L (0.8\u20132mcg/L). <1.3nmol/L may be toxic if \nthere is hypokalaemia. Signs of toxicity\u2014CVS: arrhythmias, heart block. CNS: confu-\nsion, insomnia, agitation, seeing too much yellow (xanthopsia), delirium. GI: nausea.\nGentamicin\n1,2 (p387) and tobramycin. \n1, 2 The potential for oto- and nephrotoxic-\nity is high if aminoglycosides are used inappropriately, so only prescribe for short \ntherapeutic courses and follow local expert advice/guidelines. CI in severe renal or \nliver failure, ascites, burns, high cardiac output states (eg anaemia, Paget\u2019s disease), \nchildren, and pregnancy. Signs of toxicity: tinnitus, deafness, nystag mus, vertigo, \nrenal failure. Once-daily dosing with dose adjustment is prefered as this has fewer \nSES and better bactericidal activity (eg gentamicin 5mg/kg/d or tobramycin 4mg/\nkg/d; check with pharmacist in obese patients or when using tobramycin in cystic \n\ufb01 brosis). An exception to this dosing is endocarditis: split dosing (eg gentamicin \n1mg/kg/8h or 12-hourly in renal failure) increases the synergistic bactericidal eff ect \nof other agents. Trough (just before dose) levels and renal function should initially \nbe monitored daily (can be twice weekly in stable patients with normal renal func-\ntion)\u2014aim for trough: <1mg/L for both gentamicin and tobramycin. If the trough \nlevel is out of range, withold the next dose until level <1mg/L (recheck after 12\u201324h).\nLithium\n2 (12h post dose). Guidelines vary: 0.4\u20130.8mmol/L is reasonable. Early signs \nof toxicity (Li\n+ >1.5mmol/L): tremor. Intermediate: lethargy. Late: (Li\n+ >2mmol/L) \nspasms, coma, \ufb01 ts, arrhythmias, renal failure (haemodialysis may be needed). See \nOHCS p349.\nPhenytoin.\n1,2 Trough: 40\u201380\u03bcmol/L (10\u201320mg/L). Beware if \ue000\ue001albumin, as the assay is \nfor bound phenytoin, while it is free pheny toin that is pharmacologically important. \nSigns of toxicity: ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus, sedation, dysarthria.\nTheophylline 10\u201320mg/mL (55\u2013110\u03bcmol/L). (\ue007See p810.) Take sample 4\u20136h after \nstarting an infusion (which should be stopped for ~15min just before the specimen is \ntaken). Signs of toxicity: arrhythmias, anxiety, tremor, convulsions.\nVancomycin.\n1,2 Renally excreted; dosing guided by age and renal function but typi-\ncally 500mg\u20131g/12h. Check trough levels prior to 3rd dose, aiming for: 5\u201310 mg/L \n(10\u201315mg/L in SBE/IE and less-sensitive MRSA infections). If levels too low check drug \nbeing given then cautiously increase dose; if levels high then con\ufb01 rm timing of dose/\nlevels, omit next dose, recheck levels, and consider decreasing dose or frequency.\n1 Trough levels should be taken just before the next dose. If values abnormally high, check that sample was \nindeed a trough level and not taken post-dose.\n2 Drugs for which routine monitoring is indicated.", "text_length": 3353, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 764/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 763, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.490862", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.491795", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
