These receptors, via their in\ufb02 uence on various \nenzymes, aff ect the following processes:\n  \n\u2022 The metabolism of substrates, vitamins, and minerals.\n  \n\u2022 Modulation of all other hormones and their target-tissue responses.\n  \n\u2022 Stimulation of O2 consumption and generation of metabolic heat.\n  \u2022 Regulation of protein synthesis, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\n  \n\u2022 Stimulation of demand for co-enzymes and related vitamins.\nWhy are symptoms of thyroid disease so various, and so subtle?\nSubclinical hypothyroidism Suspect if TSH >4mU/L with normal T4 and T3, and no \nsymptoms. It is common: ~10% of those >55yrs have \ue000TSH. Risk of progression to \nfrank hypothyroidism is ~2%, and increases as \ue000TSH; risk doubles if thyroid peroxi-\ndase antibodies are present, and is also increased in men. Management:\n  \n\u2022 Con\ufb01 rm that raised TSH is persistent (recheck in 2\u20134 months).\n  \n\u2022 Recheck the history: if any non-speci\ufb01 c features (eg depression), discuss bene\ufb01 ts \nof treating (p220) with the patient\u2014maybe they will function better.\n  \n\u2022 Have a low threshold for carefully supervised treatment as your patient may \nnot be so asymptomatic after all, and cardiac deaths may be prevented. Treat \nif: 1 TSH \u226510mu/L. 2 +ve thyroid autoantibodies. 3 Past (treated) Graves\u2019. 4 Other \norgan-speci\ufb01 c autoimmunity (type 1 DM, myasthenia, pernicious anaemia, viti-\nligo), as they are more likely to progress to clinical hypothyroidism. If TSH 4\u201310, \nand vague symptoms, treat for 6 months\u2014only continue if symptoms improve \n(or the patient is trying to conceive). If the patient does not fall into any of these \ncategories, monitor TSH yearly.\n  \n\u2022 Risks from well-monitored treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are small \n(but there is an \ue000risk of atrial \ufb01 brillation and osteoporosis if over-treated).\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism occurs when \ue001TSH, with normal T4 and T3. There \nis a 41% increase in relative mortality from all causes versus euthyroid control \nsubjects\u2014eg from AF and osteoporosis. Management:\n  \n\u2022 Con\ufb01 rm that suppressed TSH is persistent (recheck in 2\u20134 months).\n  \n\u2022 Check for a non-thyroidal cause: illness, pregnancy, pituitary or hypothalamic \ninsuffi  ciency (suspect if T4 or T3 are at the lower end of the reference range), use \nof TSH-suppressing medication, eg thyroxine, steroids.\n  \n\u2022 If TSH <0.1, treat on an individual basis, eg with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, AF, \nunexplained weight loss, osteoporosis, goitre.\n  \n\u2022 Options are carbimazole or propylthiouracil\u2014or radioiodine therapy.\n  \n\u2022 If no symptoms, recheck 6-monthly.\nSubclinical thyroid disease\nFig 5.16 Facial appearance in hypothyroidism. Look \nfor: pallor; coarse, brittle, diminished hair (scalp, \naxillary, and pubic); dull or blank expres sion lack ing \nsparkle; coarse features; puff y lids. These signs are \nsubtle: \ue007have a low thres hold for meas uring TSH.\nReproduced from Cox and Roper, Clinical Skills, 2005, \nwith permission from Oxford University Press.", "text_length": 3254, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 229/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 228, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.377223", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.383771", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
