The worry is of myocardial hyperexcitability leading to ven-\ntricular \ufb01 brillation and cardiac arrest. First assess the patient\u2014do they look unwell, \nis there an obvious cause? If not, could it be an artefactual result?\nConcerning signs and symptoms Include a fast irregular pulse, chest pain, weak-\nness, palpitations, and light-headedness. ECG: (see \ufb01 g 14.4) tall tented T waves, small \nP waves, a wide QRS complex (eventually becoming sinusoidal), and ventricular \ufb01 bril-\nlation.\nArtefactual results: If the patient is well, and has none of the above-mentioned \n\ufb01 ndings, repeat the test urgently as it may be artefactual, caused by: \u2022haemolysis \n(diffi  cult vene puncture; patient clenched \ufb01 st) \u2022contamination with potassium EDTA \nanticoagulant in FBC bottles (do FBCS after U&ES) \u2022thrombocythaemia (K\n+ leaks out of \nplatelets during clotting) \u2022delayed analysis (K\n+ leaks out of RBCS; a particular problem \nin a primary care setting due to long transit times to the lab).5\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Oliguric renal failure.\n  \n\u2022 K\n+-sparing diuretics.\n  \n\u2022 Rhabdomyolysis (p319).\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic acidosis (DM).\n  \n\u2022 Excess K\n+ therapy.\n  \n\u2022 Addison\u2019s disease (see p226).\n  \n\u2022 Massive blood transfusion.\n  \n\u2022 Burns.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs, eg ACE-i, suxamethonium.\n  \n\u2022 Artefactual result (see earlier \u2018Artefactual results\u2019).\nTreatment in non-urgent cases\nTreat the underlying cause; review medications.\n  \n\u2022 Polystyrene sulfonate resin (eg Calcium Resonium\u00ae 15g/8h PO) binds K\n+ in the gut, \npreventing absorption and bringing K\n+ levels down over a few days. If vomiting \nprevents PO administration, give a 30g enema, followed at 9h by colonic irrigation.\nEmergency treatment\n\ue022If there is evidence of myocardial hyperexcitability, or K\n+ is >6.5mmol/L, get senior \nassistance, and treat as an emergency (see p301).\nHypokalaemia\nIf K\n+ <2.5mmol/L, urgent treatment is required. Note that hypokalaemia exacerbates \ndigoxin toxicity.\nSigns and symptoms Muscle weakness, hypotonia, hypore\ufb02 exia, cramps, tetany, \npalpitations, light-headedness (arrhythmias), constipation.\nECG Small or inverted T waves, prominent U waves (after T wave), a long PR interval, \nand depressed ST segments.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Diuretics.\n  \n\u2022 Vomiting and diarrhoea.\n  \n\u2022 Pyloric stenosis.\n  \n\u2022 Rectal villous adenoma.\n  \n\u2022 Intestinal \ufb01 stula.\n  \n\u2022 Cushing\u2019s syndrome/steroids/ACTH.\n  \n\u2022 Conn\u2019s syndrome.\n  \n\u2022 Alkalosis.\n  \n\u2022 Purgative and liquorice abuse.\n  \n\u2022 Renal tubular failure (p316 & p664).\nIf on diuretics, \ue000HCO3\n\u03a9 is the best indication that hypokalaemia is likely to have been \nlong-standing. Mg\n2+ may be low, and hypokalaemia is often diffi  cult to correct until \nMg\n2+ levels are normalized. Suspect Conn\u2019s syndrome if hypertensive, hypokalaemic \nalkalosis in someone not taking diuretics (p228).\nIn hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, intermittent weakness lasting up to 72h ap-\npears to be caused by K\n+ shifting from extra- to intracellular \ufb02 uid. See OHCS p652.\nTreatment If mild: (>2.5mmol/L, no symptoms.) Give oral K\n+ supplement \n(\u226580mmol/24h, eg Sando-K\u00ae 2 tabs/8h). Review K\n+ after 3 days. If taking a thi-\nazide diuretic, and K\n+ >3.0 consider repeating and/or K\n+-sparing diuretic. If severe: \n(<2.5mmol/L, and/or dangerous symptoms.) Give IV potassium cautiously, not more \nthan 20mmol/h, and not more concentrated than 40mmol/L. Do not give K\n+ if oliguric. \n\ue022Never give K\n+ as a fast stat bolus dose.", "text_length": 3581, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 682/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 681, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.340840", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.343251", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
