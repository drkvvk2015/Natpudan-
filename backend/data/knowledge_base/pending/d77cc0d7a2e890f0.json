At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) this is acetylcholine (ACh). Each \nvesicle contains ~8000 ACh molecules.\n2   When an action potential arrives at the pre-synaptic terminal, depolarization \nopens voltage-gated Ca\n2+ channels (VGCCS). In Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome, anti-\nP/Q type VGCC antibodies disrupt this stage of synaptic transmission.\n15\n3   In\ufb02 ux of Ca\n2+ through the VGCCs triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles with the \npre-synaptic membrane (a process that botulinum toxin interferes with), and \nneurotransmitter is released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft.\n4   Transmitter molecules cross the synaptic cleft by diff usion and bind to re-\nceptors on the post-synaptic membrane, causing depolarization of the post-\nsynaptic membrane (the end-plate potential). This change in the post-synaptic \nmembrane triggers muscle contraction at the NMJ, or onward transmission of \nthe action potential in neurons. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies block the \npost-synaptic ACh receptors, preventing the end-plate potential from becom-\ning large enough to trigger muscle contraction\u2014and muscle weakness ensues.\n5   Transmitter action is terminated by enzyme-induced degradation of transmit-\nter (eg acetylcholinesterase), uptake into the pre-synaptic terminal or glial \ncells, or by diff usion away from synapse. Anticholinesterase treatments for\nmyasthenia gravis, such as pyridostigmine, reduce the rate of degradation of \nACh, increasing the chance that it will trigger an end-plate potential.\nHow synapses work\u2014the neuromuscular junction\nFig 10.33 Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome fea-\ntures pre-synaptic Ca\n2+-channel antibodies. \nDepressed tendon re\ufb02 exes are common, \nbecause less transmitter is released, but re-\n\ufb02 exes may \ue000 after maximum voluntary con-\ntraction due to a build of transmitter in the \nsynaptic cleft (post-tetanic potentiation). \nFig 10.32 Myasthenia gravis features post-synaptic \nAChR antibodies.
