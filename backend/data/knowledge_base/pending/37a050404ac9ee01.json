Do not rely on signs or investigations for your diagnosis, \nbut use them rather to con\ufb01 rm what you suspected. Try to put the patient at ease: a \ngood rapport may relieve distress. Introduce yourself and check whether the patient \nis comfortable. Be conversational rather than interrogative. Start with open ques-\ntions, allow the patient to tell their story, but if they stray off  topic, gently steer them \nback towards the important points.\nPresenting complaint (PC) Open questions: \u2018Why have you come to see me today?\u2019 \nRecord the patient\u2019s own words rather than medical terms.\nHistory of presenting complaint (HPC) When did it start? What was the \ufb01 rst \nthing noticed? Progress since then. Ever had it before? \u2018SOCRATES\u2019 questions: site; \nonset (gradual, sudden); character; radiation; associations (eg nausea, sweating); \ntiming of pain/duration; exacerbating and alleviating factors; severity (eg scale of \n1\u201310, compared with worst ever previous pain). Direct questioning (to narrow list of \npossible diagnoses). Speci\ufb01 c or \u2018closed\u2019 questions about the diff erential diagnoses \nyou have in mind (+risk factors, eg travel\u2014p414) and a review of the relevant system.\nPast medical history (PMH) Ever in hospital? Illnesses? Operations? Ask speci\ufb01 -\ncally about MIJTHREADS: MI, jaundice, TB, high BP, rheumatic fever, epilepsy, asthma, \ndiabetes, stroke, anaesthetic problems.\nDrug history (DH) Any tablets, injections, \u2018over-the-counter\u2019 drugs, herbal remedies, \noral contraceptives? Ask about allergies and what the patient experienced, eg may \nbe an intolerance (nausea, diarrhoea), or may have been a minor reaction of sensiti-\nzation (eg rash and wheeze) before full-blown anaphylaxis.\nSocial history (SH) Probe without prying. \u2018Who else is there at home?\u2019 Job. Marital \nstatus. Spouse\u2019s job and health. Housing\u2014any stairs at home? Who visits\u2014relatives, \nneighbours, GP, nurse? Are there any dependants at home? Mobility\u2014any walking \naids needed? Who does the cooking and shopping? What can the patient not do be-\ncause of the illness? Ask about occupation, hobbies, sport, exercise, and ethnic origin.\nThe social history is all too often seen as a dispensable adjunct but vital clues may \nbe missed about the quality of life and it is too late to ask when the surgeon\u2019s hand is \ndeep in the belly and they are wondering how radical a procedure to perform. Utilize \nthe GP\u2019s knowledge of the patient: they may have known them and/or their family for \ndecades. He or she may even hold a \u2018living will\u2019 or advance directive if they cannot \nspeak for themselves. Tactfully ask about alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs. \nHow much? How long? When stopped? 1 unit = 8g of ethanol = 1 spirits measure = 1/2 \nglass of wine = 1/3 pint of beer. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening test for \nalcoholism (p281). Quantify smoking in terms of pack-years: 20 cigarettes/day for 1 \nyear equals 1 pack-year. We all like to present ourselves well, so be inclined to double \nstated quantities (Holt\u2019s \u2018law\u2019).\nFamily history (FH) Areas of the family history may need detailed questioning, eg \nto determine if there is a signi\ufb01 cant family history of heart disease you need to ask \nabout the health of the patient\u2019s grandfathers and male siblings, smoking, tendency \nto hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and claudication before they were 60 years old, as \nwell as ascertaining the cause of death. Ask about TB, diabetes, and other relevant \ndiseases. Draw a family tree (see BOX). \ue007Be tactful when asking about a family \nhistory of malignancy.\nSystemic enquiry (See p30.) Helps uncover undeclared symptoms. Some of this \nmay already have been incorporated into the history.\n\ue007 Always enquire, without sounding robotic, if your patient has any ideas of what \nthe problem might be, if he/she has any particular concerns or expectations, and \ngive him/her an opportunity to ask you questions or tell you anything you may \nhave missed.\n\ue007Don\u2019t hesitate to review the history later: recollections change (as you will \ufb01 nd, \noften on the post-take ward round when the Consultant is asking the questions!).", "text_length": 4404, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 38/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 37, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.922610", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.923457", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
