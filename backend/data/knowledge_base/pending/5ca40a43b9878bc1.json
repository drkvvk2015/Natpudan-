Middle-\naged men are more frequently and severely aff ected than women, in whom the dis-\nease tends to present ~10yrs later (menstrual blood loss is protective).\nGenetics HH is one of the commonest inherited conditions in those of Northern Euro-\npean (especially Celtic) ancestry (carrier rate of ~1 in 10 and a frequency of homozy-\ngosity of ~1 in 200\u2013400). The gene responsible for most HH is HFE: the 2 commonest \nmutations are termed C282Y and H63D. C282Y accounts for 60\u201390% of HH, and H63D \naccounts for 1\u20133%, with compound heterozygotes accounting for 4\u20137%. Penetrance \nis variable\u2014a signi\ufb01 cant fraction of C282Y homozygotes will not develop signs of iron \noverload during follow-up, complicating screening decisions.\nThe patient Early on: Nil\u2014or tiredness; arthralgia (2nd+3rd MCP joints + knee pseudo-\ngout); \ue001libido. Later: Slate-grey skin pigmentation; signs of chronic liver disease \n(p276); hepatomegaly; cirrhosis (esp. if drinks alcohol); dilated cardiomyopathy. \nEndocrinopathies: DM (\u2018bronze diabetes\u2019 from iron deposition in pancreas); hypogonadism \n(p232) from \ue001pituitary dysfunction.\nTests Blood: \ue000LFT, \ue000ferritin (\ue032>200/\ue033>150ng/mL; but in\ufb02 ammation will also \ue000ferritin); \n\ue000transferrin saturation\n39 should all trigger suspicion. Con\ufb01 rm by HFE genotyping.\nImages: Chondro calcinosis  (\ufb01 g 6.33). Liver & cardiac MRI: Fe overload.\nLiver biopsy: Perl\u2019s stain quanti\ufb01 es iron loading\n40 and assesses disease severity.\nManagement Venesect: ~0.5\u20132 units/1\u20132wks, until ferritin \ue00550mcg/L (may take 2yrs). \nIron will continue to accumulate, so maintenance venesection is needed for life (1U every \n2\u20133 months to maintain haematocrit <0.5, ferritin <100mcg/L, and transferrin saturation \n<40%). Consider desferrioxamine (p342) if intolerant of this. Monitor: LFT and glucose/\ndiabetes (p206). HbA1c levels may be falsely low as venesection \ue001 the time available for \nHb glycosylation. If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound \u00b1 AFP twice-yearly.\nOver-the-counter drugs: Ensure vitamin preparations contain no iron.\nDiet: A well-balanced diet should be encouraged\u2014there is no need to avoid iron-rich \nfoods. Avoid alcohol. Avoid uncooked seafood (may contain bacteria that thrive on \nincreased plasma iron concentrations, eg Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulni\ufb01 cus).\nScreening: Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and HFE genotype. \ue007Screen 1st-\ndegree relatives by genetic testing even if they are asymptomatic and have normal \nLFT ideally prior to age where signi\ufb01 cant iron deposition likely to have occurred (eg \n18\u201330yrs). Since C282Y homozygotes may never develop iron overload, population \nscreening should not be performed.\nPrognosis Venesection returns life expectancy to normal if non-diabetic and non-cir-\nrhotic (and liver histology can improve). Arthropathy may improve or worsen. Gonadal \nfailure may reverse in younger men. \ue007If cirrhosis, 22\u201330% get hepatocellular cancer, \nespecially if: age >50yrs (risk \ue000 \u2248 13), HBsAg +ve (risk \ue000 \u2248 5), or alcohol abuse (risk \ue000 \u2248 2).\n39 Transferrin saturation >45% is a sensitive threshold for further screening but will lead to some false +ves.\n40 Although generally not required, biopsy quanti\ufb01 es hepatic iron loading and \ufb01 brosis. This helps deter-\nmine the severity of liver disease, particularly in those with other underlying causes of chronic liver disease.", "text_length": 3628, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 296/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 295, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.681471", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.682289", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
