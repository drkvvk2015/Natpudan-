In\ufb02 ammatory demyelination caus-\nes att acks of optic neuritis \u00b1 myelitis.29 Abnormal CSF (may mimic bacterial meningi-\ntis) and serum anti-AQP4 antibody (in 65%) help distinguish it from MS30 (table 15.1). \n\ue057: IV steroids; plasma exchange. Azathioprine and rituximab31 help prevent relapses. \nPrognosis: Variable; complete remission may occur.  Eug\u00e8ne Devic, 1858\u20131930 (French neurologist)\nDressler\u2019s syndrome This develops 2\u201310wks after an MI, heart surgery (or even \npacemaker insertion). It is thought that myocardial injury stimulates formation of \nauto antibodies against heart muscle. Symptoms: Recurrent fever and chest pain \n\u00b1 pleural or pericardial rub (from serositis). Cardiac tamponade may occur, so avoid \nanticoagulants. \ue057: Aspirin, NSAIDS, or steroids.  \nWilliam Dressler, 1890\u20131969 (US cardiologist)\nDubin\u2013Johnson syndrome There is defective hepatocyte excretion of conjugated \nbilirubin. Typically presents in late teens with intermittent jaundice \u00b1 hepatospleno-\nmegaly (autosomal recessive). Tests: \ue000Bilirubin; ALT and AST are normal; bilirubinuria \non dipstick; \ue000ratio of urinary coproporphyrin I to III. Liver biopsy: diagnostic pigment \ngranules.32 \ue057: Usually none needed.  \nIsadore N Dubin, 1913\u20131981; Frank B Johnson, b1919 (US pathologists)\nDupuytren\u2019s contracture (\ufb01 g 15.3) Progressive shortening and thickening of the \npalmar fascia causing \ufb01 nger contracture and loss of extension (often 5th \ufb01 nger). \nPrevalence: ~10% of \ue032 >65yrs (\ue000 if +ve family history). Associations: Smoking, alcohol \nuse, heavy manual labour, trauma, DM, phenytoin, HIV. Peyronie\u2019s may coexist (p708). \nIt is thought to be caused by local hypoxia. \ue057: Collagenase injections.33 Surgery may be\nneeded. \nBaron Guillaume Dupuytren, 1777\u20131835 (French surgeon, famed also for treating Napoleon\u2019s haemorrhoids)\nEkbom\u2019s syndrome (Restless legs.) Criteria: 1 Compelling desire to move legs. \n2 Worse at night. 3 Relieved by movement. 4 Unpleasant leg sensations (eg shoot-\nings or tinglings) worse at rest. Mechanism: Endogenous opioid system fault causes \naltered central processing of pain. Prevalence: 1\u20133%. \ue033:\ue032\u22482:1. Associations: Iron \nde\ufb01 ciency, uraemia, pregnancy, DM, polyneurop athy, RA, COPD. Exclude: Cramps, posi-\ntional discomfort, and local leg pathology. \ue057: Dopamine agonists are commonly used; \nalso, anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines.34\nKarl Axel Ekbom, 1907\u20131977 (Swedish neurologist)\nFabry disease X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by abnormalities in \nthe GLA gene, leading to a de\ufb01 ciency in \ue025-galactosidase A. There is accumulation \nof glycosphingolipids in skin (angiokeratoma classically in a 'swimming trunk' dis-\ntribution), eyes (corneal verticillata), heart (hypertrophy, mitral valve prolapse, \ndilated aortic root, arrhythmias, angina), kidneys (renal failure, p320), CNS (stroke) \nand nerves (neuropathy/acro paraesthesia). Prior to enzyme replacement, premature \ndeath in the 6th decade was due to CV and renal disease. \ue057: Enzyme replacement \ntherapy with \ue025 or \ue020 human agalsidase.35 \nJohannes Fabry, 1860\u20131930 (German dermatologist)\nFanconi anaemia Autosomal recessive, defective stem cell repair & chromosomal \nfragility leads to aplastic anaemia, \ue000risk of AML and breast ca (BRCA2), skin pigmenta-\ntion, absent radii, short stature, microcephaly, syndactyly, deafness, \ue001IQ, hypopituita-\nrism, and crypt orchidism. \ue057: Stem-cell transplant. Guido Fanconi, 1892\u20131979 (Swiss paediatrician)\nFelty\u2019s syndrome A triad of rheumatoid arthritis + \ue001WCC + splenomegaly (\u00b1hyper-\nsplenism, causing anaemia and \ue001platelets), recurrent infections, skin ulcers, and lym-\nphadenopathy. 95% are Rh factor +ve. Splenectomy may raise the wcc. \ue057: DMARDS \n(p547) \u00b1 rituximab if refractory.36 \nAugustus Roi Felty, 1895\u20131964 (US physician)\nFitz-Hugh\u2013C urtis syndrome Liver capsule in\ufb02 ammation causing RUQ pain due to \ntransabdominal spread of chlamydial or gonococcal infection, often with PID \u00b1 \u2018violin-\nstring\u2019 adhesions. \ue057: Antibiotics for PID (+ treat sexual partners) \u00b1 laparoscopic divi-\nsion of adhesions. \nThomas Fitz-Hugh, 1894\u20131963 (US physician); Arthur H Curtis, 1881\u20131955 (US gynaecologist)\nFoster Kennedy syndrome Optic atrophy of one eye due to optic nerve compression \n(most commonly from an olfactory groove meningioma), with papilloedema of the \nother eye secondary to \ue000ICP. There is also central scotoma and anosmia. \n \n \nRobert Foster Kennedy, 1884\u20131952 (British neurologist)\nFriedreich\u2019s ataxia Expansions of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the frataxin gene \n(recessive) causes degeneration of many nerve tracts: spinocerebellar tracts degener-\nate causing cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and dysdiado chokinesis.
