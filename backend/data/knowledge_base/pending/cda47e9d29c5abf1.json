Bacteriuria is not a disease. UTI:1 A diagnosis based on symptoms and signs. \nTests which prove bacteria in urine may provide additional information. There is no \n\u2018gold-standard\u2019 bacterial count. Lower UTI: Bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis). \nUpper UTI: Pyelonephritis = infection of kidney/renal pelvis. Abacterial cystitis/ure-\nthral syndrome: A diagnosis of exclusion in patients with dysuria and frequency, \nwithout demonstrable infection. Urethritis: See pp412\u20133.\nIncidence Annual incidence of UTI in women is 10\u201320%. 10% of men and 20% of \nwomen >65 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria (>65 years MSU is no longer diagnos-\ntic and clinical assessment is mandatory). Pyelonephritis = 3 per 1000 patient years.\nClassi\ufb01 cation\n  \n\u2022 Uncomplicated: normal renal tract structure and function.\n  \n\u2022 Complicated: structural/functional abnormality of genitourinary tract, eg obstruc-\ntion, catheter, stones, neurogenic bladder, renal transplant.\nRisk factors\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Bacterial inoculation: Sexual activity, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, \nconstipation.\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Binding of uropathogenic bacteria: Spermicide use, \ue001oestrogen, menopause.\n  \n\u2022 \ue001Urine \ufb02 ow: Dehydration, obstructed urinary tract (p640).\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Bacterial growth: DM, immunosuppression, obstruction, stones, catheter, renal \ntract malformation, pregnancy.\nSymptoms\n  \n\u2022 Cystitis: Frequency, dysuria, urgency, supra pubic pain, polyuria, haematuria.\n  \n\u2022 Acute pyelonephritis: Fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral \npain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock.\n  \n\u2022 Prostatitis: Pain: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis, bladder, lower back. Fever, \nmalaise, nausea, urinary symptoms, swollen or tender prostate on PR. See p645.\nSigns Fever, abdominal or loin tenderness. Check for a distended bladder, enlarged \nprostate. If vaginal discharge, consider PID, see p413.\n\ue007Do not rely on classical symptoms and signs in a catheterized patient.\nTests In non-pregnant women, if \u2265 3 (or one severe) symptoms of cystitis, and no \nvaginal discharge, treat empirically without further tests.\n  \n\u2022 Dipstick: Use in non-pregnant women <65 years with less than three symptoms. \nA negative dipstick reduces probability of UTI to <20%. Do not use in pregnant \nwomen. Limited data for men. No diagnostic value in catheterized sample.\n  \n\u2022 MSU culture: Conventional cut off  >10\n5 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL (but best di-\nagnostic criterion may be >10\n2\u201310\n3cfu/mL). Use in pregnant women, men, children, \nand if fail to respond to empirical antibiotics. Catheterized sample only if septic.\n  \n\u2022 Blood tests: If systemically unwell: FBC, U&E, CRP, and blood culture (positive in only \n10\u201325% of pyelonephritis). Consider fasting glucose.\n  \n\u2022 Imaging: Consider USS and referral to urology for assessment (cystoscopy, urody-\nnamics, CT) in men with upper UTI; failure to respond to treatment; recurrent UTI \n(>2/year); pyelonephritis; unusual organism; persistent haematuria.\nOrganisms Usually anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria from bowel and vaginal \n\ufb02 ora. E. coli is the main organism (75\u201395% in community but \ue001 in hospital). Staphylo-\ncoccus saprophyticus (a skin commensal) in 5\u201310%. Other enterobacteriaceae such \nas Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumonia.
