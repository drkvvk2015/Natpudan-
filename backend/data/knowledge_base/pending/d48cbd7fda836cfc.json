Take brief history, do a quick physical examination \nand a 12-lead ECG. Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia. \nOther tests on admission: U&E, troponin, glucose, cholesterol, FBC, CXR.\n  \n\u2022 Aspirin: 300mg PO (if not already given); consider ticagrelor (180mg PO) or prasug-\nrel (60mg PO if no history of stroke/TIA and <75yrs) as newer alternatives to clopi-\ndogrel (300mg PO) as they have been shown to be superior in outcome studies.\n  \n\u2022 Morphine: 5\u201310mg IV (repeat after 5min if necessary). Give anti-emetic with the 1st \ndose of morphine: metoclopramide 10mg IV (1st line), or cyclizine 50mg IV (2nd line).\n  \n\u2022 GTN: routine use now not recommended in the acute setting unless patient is hyper-\ntensive or in acute LVF. Useful as anti-anginal in chronic/stable patients.\n  \n\u2022 Oxygen is recommended if patients have SaO2 <95%, are breathless or in acute LVF.\n  \u2022 Restore coronary perfusion in those presenting <12h after symptom onset (see BOX).\n  \n\u2022 Anticoagulation: An injectable anticoagulant must be used in primary PCI. Bivali-\nrudin is preferred, if not available use enoxaparin \u00b1 a GP IIb/IIIa blocker.\n  \n\u2022 \u00df-blockers provide additional bene\ufb01 t when started early, eg bisoprolol 2.5mg PO OD. \nEnsure no evidence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, asthma/COPD, or heart block.\nRight ventricular infarction Con\ufb01 rm by demonstrating ST elevation in rV3/4 and/\nor echo. NB: rV4 means that V4 is placed in the right 5th intercostal space in the \nmidclavicular line. Treat hypotension and oliguria with \ufb02 uids (avoid nitrates and diu-\nretics). Monitor BP carefully, and assess early signs of pulmonary oedema. Intensive \nmonitoring and inotropes may be useful in some patients.\nEarly coronary reperfusion saves lives; decisions must be taken quickly so seek \nsenior advice early. Look for typical clinical symptoms of MI plus ECG criteria:\n  \n\u2022 ST elevation >1mm in \u22652 adjacent limb leads or >2mm in \u22652 adjacent chest leads.\n  \n\u2022 LBBB (unless known to have LBBB previously).\n  \n\u2022 Posterior changes: deep ST depression and tall R waves in leads V1 to V3.\nTherapy may be percutaneous intervention (PCI\u2014with angiographic identi\ufb01 cation of \nthe culprit blockage(s) and revascularization via deployment of an expandable met-\nal stent) or thrombolysis (with systemically administered clot-dissolving enzymes):\n  \n\u2022 Primary PCI: \ue022Should be off ered to all patients presenting within 12h of symptom \nonset with a STEMI who either are at or can be transferred to a primary PCI cen-\ntre within 120min of \ufb01 rst medical contact. If this is not possible, patients should \nreceive thrombolysis and be transferred to a primary PCI centre after the infusion \nfor either rescue PCI (if residual ST elevation) or angiography (if successful). Use \nbeyond 12h if evidence of ongoing ischaemia or in stable patients presenting after \n12\u201324h may be appropriate\u2014seek specialist advice.\n  \u2022 Thrombolysis: \ue022Bene\ufb01 t reduces steadily from onset of pain, target time is \n<30min from admission; use >12h from symptom onset requires specialist advice. \n\ue007Do not thrombolyse ST depression alone, T-wave inversion alone, or normal ECG. \nThrombolysis is best achieved with tissue plasminogen activators (eg tenect-\neplase as a single IV bolus).
