The bacterial cell wall is unique in nature and therefore acts as a selective \ntarget for antibiotics. Antibiotics which act on the cell wall include:\n  \n\u2022 \ue020-lactam antibiotics\n  \n\u2022 others: glycopeptides, polymyxins.\n\ue020-lactams: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam\nContain a \ue020-lactam ring which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links \nin the bacterial cell wall. Resistance occurs when the bacteria (eg staphylococci) \nproduce a \ue020-lactamase enzyme.\nPenicillins:\nSee table 9.3. Include natural penicillins (penicillin G and V) and synthetic penicillins \nwhich are chemically modi\ufb01 ed to extend their spectrum of activity, eg amoxicillin, \npiperacillin.\nIn an attempt to overcome \ue020-lactamase resistance, penicillins have been combined \nwith \ue020-lactamase inhibitors to create \ue020-lactam-\ue020-lactamase inhibitor combinations \neg co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid), Tazocin\u00ae (piperacillin+tazobactam).\nStaphylococcal resistance is conventionally de\ufb01 ned by stability to meticillin, an \nacid-labile and IV-only equivalent of \ufb02 ucloxacillin (see MRSA p388).\nCephalosporins:\nSee table 9.4. Contain a \ue020-lactam ring attached to a six-membered nuclear structure \n(\ufb01 ve in penicillin), which allows synthetic modi\ufb01 cation at two sites (one in penicil-\nlin). This means that cephalosporins are the largest groups of available antibiotics. \nClassi\ufb01 cation into \u2018generations\u2019 is not standardized: as a rough rule, the higher the \ngeneration, the wider the spectrum.\nCarbapenems:\nSee table 9.5. Broadest spectrum of all \ue020-lactam antibiotics. Seek expert microbiol-\nogy advice before use.\nMonobactam:\nAztreonam is only active against Gram-negative species including Neisseria men-\ningitidis, Haemophilus in\ufb02 uenzae, Pseudomonas. Given IV/IM. Inhaled preparation \nfor chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas (cystic \ufb01 brosis). Dose adjust for renal function. \nSEs: N&V, GI bleed, rash, \ue000LFTS, \ue001plts, paraesthesia, seizures, bronchospasm.\nNon-\ue020-lactam cell wall inhibitors\nSee \ufb01 g 9.4 and table 9.6. Includes glycopeptides, eg vancomycin, teicoplanin, and \npolymyxins, eg colistin.\nInhibitors of protein synthesis\nSee \ufb01 g 9.4 and table 9.7. Includes:\n  \n\u2022 aminoglycosides\n  \n\u2022 macrolides\n  \n\u2022 tetracyclines and derivatives of tetracycline\n  \n\u2022 others: clindamycin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid.\nInhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis\nSee \ufb01 g 9.4 and table 9.8. Includes:\n  \n\u2022 folate synthesis inhibitors: trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole\n  \n\u2022 \ufb02 uoroquinolones\n  \n\u2022 others: metronidazole, rifampicin.\n\ue007Nitrofurantoin is unique. Metabolites interfere with cell growth via ribosomes, DNA, \nRNA, and cell wall. Multiple sites of attack means \ue001resistance. Concentrates in the \nurine (but not if \ue001GFR), used in uncomplicated UTI. SES: haemolysis, pulmonary \ufb01 brosis, \nhepatotoxicity.\n\ue007Antibiotics for TB, see pp394\u20135.", "text_length": 2960, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 393/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 392, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.846626", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.847552", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
