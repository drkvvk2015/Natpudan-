The absence of claudication and the presence of normal pulses decrease the likelihood of\nmoderate to severe disease. When considering patients who are symptomatic with leg complaints, the\nmost useful individual findings are the presence of cool skin, the presence of at least 1 bruit and any palpable\npulse abnormality. The absence of any bruit (iliac, femoral and popliteal) and the presence of normal\nperipheral pulses reduce the likelihood of peripheral arterial disease\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2006 295:5\nCLINICAL FEATURES (CONT\u2019D)\nPeripheral Vascular Disease\n55", "text_length": 3828, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 69/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 68, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.330803", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.331695", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
