Accepted de\ufb01 nitions and \nreported rates vary, but a place to start is the passage of \u22642 bowel motions/wk, \noften passed with diffi  culty, straining, or pain, and a sense of incomplete evacua-\ntion. \ue033:\ue032\u22482:1. Doctors\u2019 chief concerns are to \ufb01 nd pointers to major pathology, eg \nconstip ation + rectal bleeding \u2248 cancer; constipation + distension + active bowel \nsounds \u2248 stricture/GI obstruction; constipation + menorrhagia \u2248 hypothyroidism.\nThe patient Ask about frequency, nature, and consistency of stools. Is there blood \nor mucus in/on the stools? Is there diarrhoea alternating with constipation (eg IBS, \np266)? Has there been recent change in bowel habit? Is she digitating the rectum \nor vagina to pass stool?\n15 Ask about diet and drugs. \ue007PR examination is essential \neven when referring (refer if signs of colorectal ca, eg \ue001weight, pain, or anaemia).\nTests None in young, mildly aff ected patients. Threshold for investigation di-\nminishes with age; triggers include:6 \ue001weight, abdominal mass, +PR blood, iron \nde\ufb01 ciency anaemia. Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca\n2+, TFT. Colonoscopy: If suspected colo-\nrectal malignancy. Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung\u2019s \nare occasionally needed.\nTreatment Often reassurance, drinking more, and diet/exercise advice (p245) is \nall that is needed. Treat causes (BOX \u2018Causes of constipation\u2019). A high-\ufb01 bre diet \nis often advised, but may cause bloating without helping constipation. \ue007Only use \ndrugs if these measures fail, and try to use them for short periods only. Often, \na stimulant such as senna \u00b1 a bulking agent is more eff ective and cheaper than \nagents such as lactulose. Bulking agents: \ue000Faecal mass, so stimulating peristal-\nsis. They must be taken with plenty of \ufb02 uid and may take a few days to act. CI: \ndiffi  culty in swallowing; GI obstruction; colonic atony; faecal impaction. Bran \npowder 3.5g 2\u20133 times/d with food (may hinder absorption of dietary trace ele-\nments if taken with every meal). Ispaghula husk, eg 1 Fybogel\u00ae sachet after a \nmeal, mixed in water and swallowed promptly (or else it becomes an unpleasant \nsludge). Methylcellulose, eg Celevac\u00ae 3\u20136 tablets/12h with \u2265300mL water. Ster-\nculia, eg Normacol\u00ae granules, 10mL sprinkled on food daily. Stimulant laxatives: \nIncrease intestinal motility, so do not use in intestinal obstruction or acute colitis. \nAvoid prolonged use as it may cause colonic atony. Abdominal cramps are an \nimportant SE. Pure stimulant laxatives are bisacodyl tablets (5\u201310mg at night) or \nsuppositories (10mg in the mornings) and senna (2\u20134 tablets at night). Docusate \nsodium and dantron\n16 have stimulant and softening actions. Glycerol supposito-\nries act as a rectal stimulant. Sodium picosulfate (5\u201310mg at night) is a potent \nstimulant. Stool softeners: Particularly useful when managing painful anal condi-\ntions, eg \ufb01 ssure. Arachis oil enemas lubricate and soften impacted faeces. Liquid \nparaffi  n should not be used for a prolonged period (SE: anal seepage, lipoid pneu-\nmonia, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins). Osmotic laxatives: Retain \ufb02 uid in \nthe bowel. Lactulose, a semisynthetic disaccharide, produces osmotic diarrhoea \nof low faecal pH that discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms. It \nis useful in hepatic enceph alopathy (initial dose: 30\u201350mL/12h). SE: bloating, so \nits role in treating constipation is limited. Macrogol (eg Movicol\u00ae) is another ex-\nample. Magnesium salts (eg magnesium hydroxide; magnesium sulfate) are use-\nful when rapid bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts (eg Microlette\u00ae and \nMicralax\u00ae enemas) should be avoided as they may cause sodium and water re-\ntention. Phosphate enemas are useful for rapid bowel evacuation prior to proce-\ndures.\nIf these don\u2019t help Prucalopride is an elective 5HT4 agonist with prokinetic prop-\nerties; Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal \ufb02 uid \nsecretion; Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that also increases \ufb02 uid se-\ncretion and decreases visceral pain. A multidisciplinary approach with behaviour \ntherapy, habit training \u00b1 sphincter biofeedback may help.\n15  Rectocele: front wall of the rectum bulges into the back wall of the vagina.\n16  Dantron causes colon & liver tumours in animals, so reserve use for the very elderly or terminally ill.", "text_length": 4483, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 268/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 267, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.489528", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.490350", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
