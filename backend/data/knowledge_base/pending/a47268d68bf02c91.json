Look for \nspeci\ufb01 c patterns (see later in topic) and ask these questions to help elicit the diagnosis:\n1   Where is the lesion? \u2022 Are the legs \ufb02 accid or spastic? (ie LMN or UMN?) \u2022 Is there \nsensory loss?A sensory level usually means spinal cord disease. \u2022 Is there loss of \nbowel or bladder control? (Lesion more likely to be in the conus medullaris or \ncauda equina.)\n2  What is the lesion? \u2022 Was onset sudden or rapidly progressive? \ue007This is an emer-\ngency; it suggests cord compression so get urgent help (see next paragraph). \u2022 Are \nthere any signs of infection (eg tender spine, \ue000T\u00b0, \ue000WCC, \ue000ESR, \ue000CRP: extradural abscess)?\nCord compression (See also p528.) Symptoms: Bilateral leg weakness (arm weak-\nness\u2014often less severe\u2014suggests a cervical cord lesion, see p508) a sensory level \u00b1 \npreceding back pain (see p542). Bladder (and anal) sphincter involvement is late and \nmanifests as hesitancy, frequency, and, later, as painless retention. Signs: Look for \na motor, re\ufb02 ex, and sensory level, with normal \ufb01 ndings above the level of the lesion, \nLMN signs at the level (especially in cervical lesions), and UMN signs below the level \n(but remember tone and re\ufb02 exes are usually reduced in acute cord compression; \nOHCS p756). Causes: Secondary malignancy (breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney) \nin the spine is commonest. Rarer: infection (epidural abscess), cervical disc prolapse, \nhaematoma (warfarin), intrinsic cord tumour, atlanto\u2013axial subluxation, myeloma. \n\ue031\ue031 : Transverse myelitis, MS, carcinomatous meningitis, cord vasculitis (PAN, syphilis), \nspinal artery thrombosis or aneurysm, trauma, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (p702). In-\nvestigations: \ue007Do not delay imaging at any cost. Spinal x-rays are unreliable; MRI is \nthe de\ufb01 nitive modality. Biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to identify the \nnature of any mass. Do a CXR (primary lung malignancy, lung secondaries, TB). Bloods: \nFBC, ESR, B12, syphilis serology, U&E, LFT, PSA, serum electrophoresis. Treatment: Give \nurgent dexamethasone in malignancy (p528) while considering more speci\ufb01 c thera-\npy, eg radiotherapy or chemotherapy \u00b1 decompressive laminectomy; which is most \nappropriate depends on tumour type, quality of life, and likely prognosis. Epidural \nabscesses must be surgically decompressed and antibiotics given.\nCauda equina and conus medullaris lesions The big diff erence between these \nlesions and those high up in the cord is that leg weakness is \ufb02 accid and are\ufb02 exic, \nnot spastic and hyperre\ufb02 exic. Causes: As above, plus congenital lumbar disc disease \nand lumbosacral nerve lesions. Signs: Conus medullaris lesions feature mixed UMN/\nLMN signs, leg weakness, early urinary retention and constipation, back pain, sacral \nsensory disturbance and erectile dysfunction. Cauda equina lesions feature back \npain and radicular pain down the legs; asymmetrical, atrophic, are\ufb02 exic paralysis of \nthe legs; sensory loss in a root distribution; and \ue001sphincter tone; do PR.\nOther patterns of leg weakness\nUnilateral foot drop: DM, common peroneal nerve palsy, stroke, prolapsed disc, MS.\nWeak legs with no sensory loss: MND, polio , para sagittal meningioma (an exception \nto the rule that weak legs mean cord or distal lesion).\nChronic spastic paraparesis: MS, cord primary malignancy/metastasis, MND, syrin-\ngomyelia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334), hereditary spastic \nparaparesis, taboparesis (tertiary syphilis, see p412), histiocytosis X, parasites (eg \nschistosomiasis).\nChronic \ufb02 accid paraparesis: Peripheral neur o pathy, myopathy.\nAbsent knee jerks and extensor plantars: (Ie combined LMN or UMN signs.) Com-\nbined cervical and lumbar disc disease, conus medullaris lesions, MND, myeloradicu-\nlitis, Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, taboparesis.\n4\n4 Tertiary syphilis (p412): in tabes dorsalis the aff erent pathways from muscle spindles are lost, with \nreduced tone and tendon re\ufb02 exes (without weakness). Later, additional involvement of the pyramidal \ntracts causes taboparesis\u2014a spastic paraparesis with the peculiar combination of extensor plantars \n(from the taboparesis) and absent tendon reflexes (from the tabes dorsalis).", "text_length": 4381, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 474/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 473, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.986054", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.986973", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
