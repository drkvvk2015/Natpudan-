In a tension pneumothorax, air is drawn \ninto the intrapleural space with each breath, but cannot escape due to a valve-like \neff ect of the tiny \ufb02 ap in the parietal pleura. The increasing pressure progressively \nembarrasses the heart and the other lung.\n\ue022100% oxygen.\nProdedure\n  \u2022 Insert a large-bore IV cannula (eg Ven\ufb02 on\u00ae) usually through the 2nd intercostal \nspace in the midclavicular line or the \u2018safe triangle\u2019 for chest drain insertion (see BOX \n\u2018The \u201csafe triangle\u201d for insertion\u2019). Remove the stylet, allowing the trapped air to es-\ncape, usually with an audible hiss. This converts the tension pneumothorax to an open \npneumothorax. Tape securely. \u2022 Don\u2019t recover the cannula as tensioning will recur.\n  \n\u2022 Proceed to formal chest drain insertion (see p766).\nRelieving a tension pneumothorax\nIdentify the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line (or 4\u20136th intercostal \nspace in the midaxillary line) and in\ufb01 ltrate with 1% lidocaine down to the pleura \noverlying the pneumothorax.\n  \n\u2022 Insert a 16G cannula into the pleural space. Remove the needle and connect the \n cannula to a 3-way tap and a 50mL syringe. Aspirate up to 2.5L of air (50mL\u224850). \nStop if resistance is felt, or if the patient coughs excessively.\n  \n\u2022 Request a CXR to con\ufb01 rm resolution of the pneumothorax. If successful, consider \ndischarging the patient and repeating the CXR after 24h to exclude recurrence, \nand again after 7\u201310d. Advise to avoid air travel for 6 weeks after a normal CXR. \nDiving should be permanently avoided.\n  \n\u2022 If aspiration is unsuccessful (in a signi\ufb01 cant, symptomatic pneumothorax), insert \nan intercostal drain (see p766).\nAspiration of a pneumothorax \nFig 18.7 The safe \u2018triangle\u2019 is not re-\nally a triangle, as the axilla cuts off  the \npoint of the triangle. Draw a line along \nthe lateral border of pectoralis major, a \nline along the anterior border of latis-\nsimus dorsi, and a line superior to the \nhorizontal level of the nipple. The apex \nof the triangle is the axilla. Often chest \ndrains are inserted directly under ultra-\nsound guidance, or with a pre-marked \nspot; however, in an emergency or for \naspiration, the landmarks of the safe \ntriangle are important to know.", "text_length": 3097, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 775/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 774, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.514606", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.516460", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
