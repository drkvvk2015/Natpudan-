Some pa-\ntients experience tactile or visual hallucinations. Delirium can be: \u2022hyperactive, \nwith restlessness, mood lability, agitation, or aggression \u2022hypoactive in which the \npatient becomes slow and withdrawn or \u2022mixed. \ue007Hypoactive and mixed delirium \nare much harder to recognize: it is crucial to compare current behaviour to the \npatient\u2019s baseline (see BOX).\nRisk factors >65y, dementia/previous cognitive impairment, hip fracture, acute ill-\nness, psychological agitation (eg pain).\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Surgery/post-GA.\n  \n\u2022 Systemic infection: pneumonia, UTI, malaria, wounds, IV lines.\n  \n\u2022 Intracranial infection or head injury.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs/drug withdrawal: opiates, levodopa, sedatives, recreational.\n  \n\u2022 Alcohol withdrawal (2\u20135d post-admission; \ue000LFTS, \ue000MCV; history of alcohol abuse).\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic: uraemia, liver failure, Na\n+ or \ue000\ue001glucose, \ue001Hb, malnutrition (beriberi, p268).\n  \n\u2022 Hypoxia: respiratory or cardiac failure.\n  \n\u2022 Vascular: stroke, myocardial infarction.\n  \n\u2022 Nutritional: thiamine, nicotinic acid, or B12 de\ufb01 ciency.\nDiff erentials Dementia (see BOX), anxiety, epilepsy: \ue007non-convulsive status epi-\nlepticus is an underdiagnosed cause of impaired cognition and odd behaviour: con-\nsider an EEG. Primary mental illness (eg schizophrenia) can also mimic delirium, \nbut this is rare on the wards (especially if no past history).\nTests Look for the cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U&E, LFT, blood glucose, \nABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, blood cultures); also consider ECG, malaria \n\ufb01 lms, LP, EEG, CT.\nManagement As well as identifying and treating the underlying cause, aim to:3\n  \n\u2022 Reorientate the patient: explain where they are and who you are at each encounter. \nHunt down hearing aids/glasses. Visible clocks/calendars may help.\n  \n\u2022 Encourage visits from friends and family.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor \ufb02 uid balance and encourage oral intake . Be vigilant for constipation.\n  \n\u2022 Mobilize and encourage physical activity.\n  \n\u2022 Practise sleep hygeine: restrict daytime napping, minimize night-time disturbance.\n  \n\u2022 Avoid or remove catheters, IV cannulae, monitoring leads and other devices (they \nincrease infection risk and may get pulled out).\n  \n\u2022 Watch out for infection and physical discomfort/distress.\n  \n\u2022 Review medication and discontinue any unnecessary agents. Only use sedation if the \npatient is a risk to their own/other patients\u2019 safety (never use physical restraints). \nConsider haloperidol 0.5\u20132mg, or chlorpromazine 50\u2013100mg, PO if they will take it, \nIM if not (p15). Wait 20min to judge eff ect\u2014further doses can be given if needed. \nNB: avoid chlor promazine in the elderly and in alcohol withdrawal (p280); avoid \nantipsychotics in those with Parkinson\u2019s disease or Lewy body dementia.\n\ue007Be aware that delirium may persist beyond the duration of the original illness by \nseveral weeks in the elderly. Do not assume this must be dementia\u2014provide support \nand reassess 1\u20132 months later.\n10 Delirium, from the Latin de (from) and lira (ridge between furrows), meaning \u2018out of one\u2019s furrow\u2019.", "text_length": 3675, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 492/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 491, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.016447", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.018802", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
