Severity: the more severe, \nthe larger the left ventricle.\nTests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale if in sinus rhythm (may mean \ue000left atrial size); LVH. CXR: big LA \n& LV; mitral valve calci\ufb01 cation; pulmonary oedema.\nEchocardiogram: To assess LV function and MR severity and aetiology (transoesoph-\nageal to assess severity and suitability for repair rather than replacement). Cardiac \ncatheterization to con\ufb01 rm diagnosis, exclude other valve disease, and assess coro-\nnary artery disease (can combine CABG with valve surgery).\nManagement: Control rate if fast AF. Anticoagulate if: AF; history of embolism; pros-\nthetic valve; additional mitral stenosis. Diuretics improve symptoms. Surgery\n4 for \ndeteriorating symptoms; aim to repair or replace the valve before LV is irreversibly \nimpaired.\nMitral valve prolapse: Is the most common valvular abnormality (prevalence: ~5%). \nOccurs alone or with: ASD, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Turner\u2019s syn-\ndrome, Marfan\u2019s syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, \nWPW (p133). Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. May develop atypical chest pain, \npalpitations, and autonomic dysfunction symptoms. Signs: Mid-systolic click and/\nor a late systolic murmur. Complications: MR, cerebral emboli, arrhythmias, sud-\nden death. Tests: Echo is diagnostic. ECG may show inferior T-wave inversion. \ue057: \n\ue020-blockers may help palpit ations and chest pain. Surgery if severe MR.\nMitral stenosis Causes: Rheumatic fever, congenital, mucopolysaccharidoses, \nendo cardial \ufb01 broelastosis, malignant carcinoid (p271; rare), prosthetic valve.\nPresentation: Normal mitral valve ori\ufb01 ce area is ~4\u20136cm\n2. Symptoms usually be-\ngin when the ori\ufb01 ce becomes <2cm\n2. Pulmonary hypertension causes dyspnoea, \nhaemoptysis, chronic bronchitis-like picture; pressure from large left atrium on local \nstructures causes hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia (oesophagus), \nbronchial obstruction; also fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, systemic emboli, infec-\ntive endocarditis (rare).\nSigns: Malar \ufb02 ush on cheeks (due to \ue001cardiac output); low-volume pulse; AF common \n(due to enlarged LA); tapping, non-displaced, apex beat (palpable S1); RV heave. On \nauscultation: loud S1; opening snap (pliable valve); rumbling mid-diastolic murmur \n(heard best in expiration, with patient on left side). Graham Steell murmur (p46) may \noccur. Severity: the more severe the stenosis, the longer the diastolic murmur, and \nthe closer the opening snap is to S2.\nTests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale; RVH; progressive RAD. CXR: left atrial enlargement (double \nshadow in right cardiac silhouette); pulmonary oedema; mitral valve calci\ufb01 cation. \nEcho is diagnostic. Signi\ufb01 cant stenosis exists if the valve ori\ufb01 ce is <1cm\n2/m\n2 body \nsurface area. Indications for cardiac catheterization: previous valvotomy; signs of \nother valve disease; angina; severe pulmonary hypertension; calci\ufb01 ed mitral valve.\nManagement: If in AF, rate control (p130) is crucial; anticoagulate with warfarin \n(p350). Diuretics \ue001 preload and pulmonary venous congestion. If this fails to control \nsymptoms, balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calci\ufb01 ed valve), open mitral valvot-\nomy, or valve replacement.\n4 In patients with severe symptoms for whom open surgery is too dangerous, consider transcatheter valve \nrepair, eg with MitraClip\u00ae.
