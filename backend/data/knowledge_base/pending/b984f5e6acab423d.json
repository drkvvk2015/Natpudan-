Highly infectious. Transmission by contact \nwith infected people, environment, food (~10%). Most common cause of infectious GI \ndisease, ~600 000 cases in England/yr. Presentation: 12\u201348h after exposure, lasting \n24\u201372h: acute-onset vomiting, watery diarrhoea, cramps, nausea. Virus shed in stool \neven if asymptomatic. Numerous genotypes and unknown longevity of immunity \ue018 \nrepeat infection occurs. Diagnosis: clinical, stool sample reverse transcriptase PCR. \nTreatment: supportive, anti-motility agents, usually self-limiting.\nRotavirus: Double-stranded RNA virus. Wheel-like appearance on EM \ue018 \u2018rota\u2019. Com-\nmonest cause of gastroenteritis in children (~50%). Most infected by 5y. Presenta-\ntion: incubation ~2d. Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3\u20138d, fever, abdominal pain. \nDiagnosis: clinical, antigen in stool. Treatment: supportive. Routine vaccination in UK \n(p407). Virus shed in stool post vaccine \ue018 careful hygiene if immunosuppressed and \nchanging nappies. Live vaccine \ue018 delay vaccination if in utero biological agents with \nactive transfer across placenta (eg in\ufb02 iximab, adalimumab).\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli: Gram \u03a9ve anaerobe. Disease due to heat-stable or heat-\nlabile toxin which stimulates Na+, Cl- and water effl  ux into gut lumen. ~20% of all \ninfective diarrhoea, ~80% of traveller\u2019s diarrhoea. Presentation: incubation 1\u20133d. \nWatery diarrhoea, cramps. Lasts ~3\u20134d. Diagnosis: clinical, identi\ufb01 cation of toxin \nfrom stool culture. Treatment: supportive. See Traveller\u2019s diarrhoea p429.\nClostridium perfringens (type A): Gram +ve, anaerobe. Produces enterotoxin. \nSpores survive cooking and germinate during unrefrigerated storage. 2\u201330 out-\nbreaks/yr in UK. Presentation: sudden-onset diarrhoea, cramps, usually lasts <24h. \nDiagnosis: stool toxin, quanti\ufb01 cation of faecal bacteria. Treatment: supportive. \n\ue020-toxin of C. perfringens type C can cause a necrotizing enteritis with fulminant dis-\nease, pain, bloody diarrhoea, septic shock. \ue020-toxin is sensitive to trypsin proteolysis \nso \ue000 risk with trypsin inhibition by sweet potatoes, ascaris infection \ue018 occurs in New \nGuinea (\u2019pigbel\u2019), central/south America, south-east Asia, China.\nCholera: Vibrio cholerae is a Gram \u03a9ve, aerobic, \u2018comma-shaped\u2019 \ufb02 agellated motile \nvibrat ing/swarming rod. Found in faecally contaminated water. Serovars O1 and O139 \ncause disease. ~190 000 cases in 2014 (\ufb01 g 9.36). Last indigenous case in UK in 1893. Pres-\nentation: incubation 2h\u20135d. ~75% asymptomatic but shed bacteria. Profuse (1L/h) \ndiarrhoea (\u2018rice-water\u2019 stool), vomiting, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, circulatory \ncollapse, death. Diagnosis: Clinical: death due to dehydration from watery diarrhoea \nage >5y, or any watery diarrhoea age >5y during known epidemic. Identi\ufb01 cation of \nserovars 01 or 0139 in stool. Rapid dipstick testing available but culture con\ufb01 rmation \nrecommended. Treatment: \ue022oral rehydration salts (WHO/UNICEF ORS sachet) will \ntreat12 up to 80%. Needs safe water. Adults may need 1L/hr initially: off er 100mL/5 \nmin. NG if vomiting. IV \ufb02 uids if severely dehydrated: Ringer\u2019s lactate or 0.9% saline \nplus ORS (beware \ue001 K+) up to 200mL/kg in \ufb01 rst 24h. Antibiotics in severe dehydration \nto \ue001 diarrhoea: doxycycline (single dose 300mg) or tetracycline (3d course) guided \nby local susceptibility (azithromycin in children/pregnancy). Zinc shortens illness \nin child ren (10\u201320mg/24h). Prevention: cholera loves \ufb01 lth: clean water (and clean \npolitics) abolishes it. Oral cholera vaccines (56\u201394% effi  cacy in adults) dependent on \nlogistics, cost, production capacity. Antibiotic prophylaxis breeds resistance.\nFig 9.36 Cholera: areas \nreporting outbreaks \n2010\u20132014.\nReproduced with permis-\nsion from World Health \nOrganization, Countries \nreporting cholera, \n2010\u20132015. \u00a9World Health \nOrganization 2016. http://\nwww.who.int/gho/epidemic_dis-\neases/cholera/epidemics/en/", "text_length": 4068, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 438/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 437, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.927340", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.928082", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
