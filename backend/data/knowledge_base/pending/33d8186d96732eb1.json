Fate did not repay this generosity: his \npersonal wealth depreciated away in the German \nhyperin\ufb02 ation of the 1920s, and he spent his later \nyears in bankruptcy. \nReproduced under Creative Commons Attribution \nonly licence CC BY 4.0 from Wellcome Library, \nLondon, https://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2010/08/13/wellcome-\nimage-of-the-month-the-left-hand-of-anna-roentgen", "text_length": 1727, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 726/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 725, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.420820", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.422336", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
