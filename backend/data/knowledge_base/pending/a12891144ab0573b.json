When we contemplate a diagram like this (of seem-\ningly galactic complexity) we, being doctors, think \u2018What can go wrong?\u2019 With a sinking feeling \nwe realize that every arc is an opportunity for multiple disasters. Perhaps, using the Hammer of \nLos (p322) and our own ingenuity we might occasionally complete these pathways without Sod \nintervening (Sod\u2019s law states that if something can go wrong, it will\u2014here Sod\u2019s tubercular breath \nis seen blowing the red cell line off  course\u2014TB is a famous cause of leukoerythroblastic anaemia). \nWhen we realize that every day each of us makes 175 billion red cells, 70 billion granulocytes, and \n175 billion platelets we sense that Sod is smiling to himself with especial relish. Anything can go \nwrong. Everything can go wrong. This latter we call aplastic anaemia. Agranulocytosis is when \nthe Southerly arcs go wrong; thrombocytopenia when the West-pointing arcs go wrong. To the \nEast we have the lymphocytes and their B- and T-cell complexities. Anaemia lies in the North of this \ndiagram. And as for bleeding\u2014how could our predecessors bear to waste a single drop of this stuff  \non purpose? Our minds are reeling at 175 billion red cells per day\u2014but this is just when the system \nis idling. When we bleed, throughput can rise by an order of magnitude\u2014if Sod is turning a blind \neye are there suffi  cient haematinics (eg iron, B12 , and folate) to allow maximum haemopoiesis?\nFigure \u00a9Aria Rad.", "text_length": 1567, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 373/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 372, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.809742", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.810810", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
