These \nshare a common underlying pathology\u2014plaque rupture, thrombosis, and in\ufb02 amma-\ntion. However, ACS may rarely be due to emboli, coronary spasm, or vasculitis (p556) \nin normal coronary arteries. Myocardial infarction means there is myocardial cell \ndeath, releasing troponin. Ischaemia means a lack of blood supply, \u00b1cell death. MIS \nhave troponin rises, unstable angina does not. An MI may be a STEMI\u2014ACS with ST-\nsegment elevation (may only be present in V7\u2013V9 if posterior STEMI) or new-onset \nLBBB; or an NSTEMI\u2014trop-positive ACS without ST-segment elevation\u2014the ECG may \nshow ST depression, T-wave inversion, non-speci\ufb01 c changes, or be normal. The de-\ngree of irreversible myocyte death varies, and signi\ufb01 cant necrosis can occur without \nST elevation.\nRisk factors Non-modi\ufb01 able: age, \ue032 gender, family history of IHD (MI in 1st-degree \nrelative <55yrs). Modi\ufb01 able: smoking, hypertension, DM, hyperlipid aemia, obesity, \nsedentary lifestyle, cocaine use. Controversial risk factors include: stress, type A \npersonality, LVH, \ufb01 brinogen\ue000, hyperinsulinaemia, \ue000homocysteine levels, ACE genotype.\nIncidence 5/1000 per annum (UK) for ST-segment elevation (declining in UK & USA).\nDiagnosis An increase in cardiac biomarkers (eg troponin) and either: symptoms of \nischaemia, ECG changes of new ischaemia, development of pathological Q waves, new \nloss of myocardium, or regional wall motion abnormalities on imaging.\nSymptoms Acute central chest pain, lasting >20min, often associated with nausea, \nsweatiness, dyspnoea, palpitations. ACS without chest pain is called \u2018silent\u2019; mostly \nseen in elderly and diabetic patients. Silent MIs may present with: syncope, pulmo-\nnary oedema, epigastric pain and vomiting, post-operative hypotension or oliguria, \nacute confusional state, stroke, and diabetic hyperglycaemic states.\nSigns Distress, anxiety, pallor, sweatiness, pulse \ue000 or \ue001, BP \ue000 or \ue001, 4th heart sound. \nThere may be signs of heart failure (\ue000JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal crepitations) or a \npansystolic murmur (papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD). Low-grade fever \nmay be present. Later, a pericardial friction rub or peripheral oedema may develop.\nTests ECG: (See \ufb01 g 3.21.) STEMI: classically, hyperacute (tall) T waves, ST elevation, \nor new LBBB occur within hours. T-wave inversion and pathological Q waves follow \nover hours to days (p98). NSTEMI/unstable angina: ST depression, T wave inversion, \nnon-speci\ufb01 c changes, or normal. \ue007In 20% of MI, the ECG may be normal initially. \nPaced ECGs and ECGs with chronic bundle branch block are unhelpful for diagnos-\ning NSTEMIs14 and may hinder STEMI15 diagnosis; in these cases, clinical assessment \nand troponin levels are especially important. CXR: Look for cardiomegaly, pulmonary \noedema, or a widened mediastinum. Don\u2019t routinely delay treatment whilst waiting \nfor a CXR. Blood: FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids, cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes: (See \nBOX \u2019Troponin\u2018.) Cardiac troponin levels (T and I) are the most sensitive and spe-\nci\ufb01 c markers of myocardial necrosis. Diff erent hospitals use diff erent assays: check \nthe required timing of troponin blood samples where you work (eg two samples 3h \napart). Other cardiac enzymes (see \ufb01 g 3.22) are sensitive but less speci\ufb01 c; their role \nin ACS diagnosis is decreasing as troponin testing improves. Echo: Regional wall \nabnormalities.\nDiff erential diagnosis (p94.) Stable angina, pericarditis, myocarditis, Takotsubo \ncardiomyopathy (p145), aortic dissection (p655), PE, oesophageal re\ufb02 ux/spasm, pneu-\nmothorax, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis.\nManagement See p120, pp798\u2013801.\nMortality 50% of deaths occur within 2h of onset of symptoms. Up to 7% die before \ndischarge. Worse prognosis if: elderly, LV failure, and ST changes. 16", "text_length": 3966, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 126/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 125, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.074783", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.075776", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
