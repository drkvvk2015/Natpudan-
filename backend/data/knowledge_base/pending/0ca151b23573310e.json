History: Lumps; swelling related to food; pain. \nExamination: Note external swelling; look for secretions; bimanual palpation for \nstones. Examine VIIth nerve and regional lymph nodes. Cytology: Do FNA.\nAcute swelling Think of mumps and HIV. Recurrent unilateral pain and swelling \nis likely to be from a stone. 80% are sub-\nmandibular. The classical story is of pain \nand swelling on eating\u2014with a red, tender, \nswollen, but uninfected gland. The stone \nmay be seen on plain X-ray or by sialography \n(\ufb01 g 13.20). Distal stones are removed via the \nmouth but deeper stones may require exci-\nsion of the gland. Chronic bilateral symp-\ntoms may coexist with dry eyes and mouth \nand autoimmune disease, eg hypothyroidism, \nMikulicz\u2019s or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (p706 & \np710)\u2014also bulimia or alcohol excess. Fixed \nswelling may be from a tumour/ALL (\ufb01 g 8.49, \np355), sar coid, amyloid, granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis , or be idiopathic.\nSalivary gland tumours (table 13.9) \u201880% are \nin the parotid, 80% of these are pleomorphic adenomas, 80% of these are in the super-\n\ufb01 cial lobe.\u2019 De\ufb02 ection of the ear outwards is a classic sign. \ue007Remove any salivary gland \nswelling for assessment if present for >1 month.

Remove \nby super\ufb01 cial parotidectomy. Adenolymphomas (Warthin\u2019s tumour): usually older \nmen; soft; treat by enucleation. Carcinomas: rapid growth; hard \ufb01 xed mass; pain; \nfacial palsy. Treatment: surgery + radiotherapy.\nSalivary gland pathology\nFig 13.20 Normal sialogram of the sub-\nmandibular gland.
