Measure calcium, phosphate, ALP, PTH, and \n25-OH vit D if eGFR <30.\n  \n\u2022 Treat if phosphate >1.5mmol/L (>1.7mmol/L if RRT) with dietary restriction \u00b1 phos-\nphate binders. The use of binders which do not contain calcium may be bene\ufb01 cial \nin preventing vascular calci\ufb01 cation.\n  \n\u2022 Give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if de\ufb01 cient. If \ue000PTH per-\nsists or is increasing, treat with an activated vit D analogue eg 1\ue025-calcidol or calci-\ntriol. Paricalcitol suppresses PTH with less eff ect on gut absorption of calcium and \nphosphate and is less likely to cause \ue000calcium/phosphate.\nRestless legs/cramps: Exclude iron de\ufb01 ciency as a possible exacerbating factor. \nGive sleep hygiene advice. Treatment for severe cases with gabapentin/pregabalin/\ndopamine agonists is off  licence and may be complicated by side-eff ects (falls, cogni-\ntive impairment, impulse-control disorder).\nDiet: Expert dietary advice should be available regarding protein intake, K\n+ if hyper-\nkalaemic, and phosphate restriction (eg dairy products).\nTreatment of other complications of CKD\nCardiovascular disease: CKD confers \ue000risk of cardiovascular disease due to \ue000BP, vas-\ncular stiff ness, in\ufb02 ammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal endothelial function (CV \nrisk often higher than the risk of kidney failure).\n  \n\u2022 Antiplatelets (low-dose aspirin) for CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events unless \nbleeding risk outweighs bene\ufb01 t (mortality bene\ufb01 t unclear in CKD).\n  \n\u2022 Atorvastatin 20mg (and higher if GFR >30) for primary and secondary prevention \nof cardiovascular disease.\n  \n\u2022 CKD should not aff ect treatment for heart failure but \ue000monitoring of GFR and K\n+.\n  \n\u2022 GFR <60 may aff ect troponin and BNP values. Interpret results cautiously with con-\nsideration for the GFR.\nPreparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT)\nPlanning for RRT should begin in progressive CKD when the risk of renal failure is \n10\u201320% within a year. Referral to nephrology less than 1 year before RRT is required \nis considered a late referral.\nAll suitable patients should be listed for a deceased donor transplantation \n6 months before the anticipated start of RRT. All suitable patients should be informed \nabout the advantages of a pre-emptive living kidney transplant and eff orts made to \n\ufb01 nd a donor (p308).\n\ue007Never prescribe in renal failure before checking how administration should be \naltered due to a \ue001GFR. This will be determined largely by the extent to which a \ndrug is renally excreted. This is signi\ufb01 cant for aminoglycosides, penicillins, \ncephalo sporins, heparin, lithium, opiates, and digoxin. Loading doses should not \nbe changed.\nIf precision is required for dosing (eg chemotherapy) then GFR should not be \nestimated from creatinine: a cystatin C or direct measure of GFR should be used.\nIf the patient is receiving renal replacement (haemo\ufb01 ltration, peritoneal or hae-\nmodialysis), dose modi\ufb01 cation depends on the extent to which a drug is cleared \nfrom the circulation by dialysis/\ufb01 ltration.\nThe best prescribing guide to consult is the Renal Drug Database/Handbook \n(www.renaldrugdatabase.com), an invaluable resource detailing dose modi\ufb01 cation in \nrenal failure and in renal replacement for almost any drug you could wish to use. \nAll hospitals should have access: speak to your pharmacist.\nPrescribing in CKD", "text_length": 3528, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 313/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 312, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.705871", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.706697", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
