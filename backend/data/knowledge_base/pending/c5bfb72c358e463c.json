He is famous for riding can-\nnonballs, travelling to the moon, and \npulling himself out of a swamp by his \nown hair. \ue022In emergencies (we\u2019ve all \nhad that sinking feeling\u2026), this method \nmay save your life, for example in your \n\ufb01 nal exams (\ufb01 g 15.11):\nExaminer: \u2018What is ITP?\u2019\nYou: \u2018ITP is idiopathic thrombocyto-\npenic purpura.\u2019 (you have scored 50% \nalready).\nExaminer: \u2018And what is idiopathic \nthrombocytopenic purpura?\u2019\nYou: \u2018It\u2019s when a cryptogenic cause of a low platelet count leads to purpura.\u2019\nYou have deployed your skills with logical brilliance, without adding a single in-\nsight. For this M\u00fcnchausen circularity you may be awarded 100%\u2014unless your \nexaminer is a philosopher, when the right answer would be \u2018What is ITP? I don\u2019t \nknow\u2014and nor do you\u2019\u2014but don\u2019t try this too often. You see, you must never for-\nget that medicine is marvellously scienti\ufb01 c, and no one is popular who dares cast \ndoubt on this article of faith.\nWho was Baron M\u00fcnchausen?\nFig 15.10 Milroy disease. Lymphoedema may be \nprimary, as in Milroy or Meige disease, and is a fea-\nture in both Turner and Noonan syndromes. More \ncommonly it is secondary to other conditions, eg \ncancer (after surgery, lymph node dissection, radi-\notherapy, or from direct tumour eff ect), cellulitis, \nvaricose veins, or immobility/dependency. Filaria-\nsis (p421) is a common cause in tropical regions.\nFig 15.9 Lens dislocation in Marfan\u2019s synd-\nrome: here the lens is dislocated superiorly \nand medially.\nCourtesy of Prof Jonathan Trobe.\nFig 15.11 M\u00fcnchausen during his \ufb01 nals.", "text_length": 1848, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 715/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 714, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.397779", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.399039", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
