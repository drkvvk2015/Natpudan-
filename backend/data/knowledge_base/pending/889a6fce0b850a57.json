Finish 12-lead ECGs with a long rhythm strip \nin lead II. \nQRS complexes: the long and the short\nQRS complexes represent ventricular depolariza-\ntion, and width represents time, so a broader QRS \ncomplex means depolarization of the ventricles is \ntaking longer. Normally, a wave of depolarization reaches the ventricles via the spe-\ncialist conduction pathways\u2014the bundles of His. This delivers the electrical activity \nto certain points of the ventricles, meaning the waves of depolarization need travel \nas short a distance as possible to depolarize all the ventricular myocardium. This al-\nlows rapid spread of depolarization and thus an effi  cient contraction action as both \nventricles contract from apex to out\ufb02 ow tracts together. Hence, the QRS complex is \nnarrow (<120ms).\nVentricular depolarization takes longer when depolarization is not initiated in this \npattern. For example, if it originates in the ventricles (eg ventricular ectopics, VT) \nor if one or more branches of the bundles of His are blocked\u2014bundle branch blocks \n\u2014meaning depolarization is initiated in one ventricle but not the other, so it has to \ntravel the long (in time and space) path from one ventricle to the other.\nVentricular depolarization also takes longer if all conduction is slowed. This may \nhappen in some electrolyte imbalances, eg hyperkalaemia.\nRight bundle branch block: (p102, \ufb01 g 3.8) QRS >0.12s, \u2018RSR\u2019 pattern in V1; dominant R in \nV1; inverted T waves in V1\u2013V3 or V4; wide, slurred S wave in V6. Causes: normal variant \n(isolated RBBB), pulmonary embolism, cor pulmonale.\nLeft bundle branch block: (p101, \ufb01 g 3.7) QRS >0.12s, \u2018M\u2019 pattern in V5, dominant S in \nV1, inverted T waves in I, aVL, V5\u2013V6. Causes: IHD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, idi-\nopathic \ufb01 brosis. \ue007NB: if there is LBBB, no comment can be made on the ST segment or \nT wave. \ue007\ue007New LBBB may represent a STEMI, see p798.\nBifascicular block: The combination of RBBB and left bundle hemiblock, manifest as \nan axis deviation, eg left axis deviation in the case of left anterior hemiblock.\nTrifascicular block: Bifascicular block plus 1st-degree HB. \ue007May need pacing (p132).\nSuspect left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if the R wave in V6 is >25mm or the sum \nof the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V6 is >35mm (see \ufb01 g 3.41).\nSuspect right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) if dominant R wave in V1, T wave inver-\nsion in V1\u2013V3 or V4, deep S wave in V6, right axis deviation.\nOther causes of dominant R wave in V1: RBBB, posterior MI, type A WPW syndrome \n(p133).\nCauses of low-voltage QRS complex: (QRS <5mm in all limb leads.)
