Vomiting, collapse, seizures, and coma often follow. Coma/drowsiness may \nlast for days. Some patients report a preceding, \u2018sentinel\u2019 headache, perhaps due to \na small warning leak from the off ending aneurysm (~6%).\nSigns Neck stiff ness; Kernig\u2019s sign (takes 6h to develop); retinal, subhyaloid and vit-\nreous bleeds (=Terson\u2019s syndrome; \ue000mortality \u2248 5). Focal neurology at presentation \nmay suggest site of aneurysm (eg pupil changes indicating a IIIrd nerve palsy with \na posterior communicating artery aneurysm) or intracerebral haematoma. Later \nde\ufb01 cits suggest complications (see later in topic). \nCauses \u2022 Berry aneurysm rupture (80%). Common sites: junctions of poster ior \ncommunicating with the internal carotid (see \ufb01 g 10.3, p451) or of the anterior com-\nmunicating with the anterior cerebral artery, or bifurcation of the middle cerebral \nartery (\ufb01 g 10.17). 15% are multiple. \u2022Arterio-venous malform ations (15%).\u2022 Other \ncauses; encephalitis, vasculitis, tumour (invading blood vessels), idiopathic.\nRisk factors Previous aneurysmal SAH (new aneurysms form, old ones get bigger), \nsmoking, alcohol misuse, \ue000BP, bleeding disorders, SBE (mycotic aneurysm), family his-\ntory (3\u20135x \ue000risk of SAH in close relatives). Polycystic kidneys, aortic coarctation, and \nEhlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (p149) are all associated with berry aneurysms.\nDiff erentials Meningitis (p822), migraine (p458), intracerebral bleed, cortical vein \nthrombosis (p480), dissection of a carotid or vertebral artery, benign thunderclap \nheadache (triggered by Valsalva manoeuvre, eg cough, coitus).\nTests \u2022 Urgent CT: Detects >95% of SAH within the 1st 24h (\ufb01 g 10.18). \u2022 Consider \nLP: If CT \u03a9ve but the history is very suggestive of SAH (and no CI: p768). This needs to \nbe done >12h after headache onset to allow breakdown of RBCs so that a positive \nsample is xanthrochromic (yellow, due to bilirubin: diff erentiaties between old blood \nfrom SAH vs a \u2018bloody tap\u2019).\nManagement \ue007Refer all proven SAH to neurosurgery immediately.\n  \n\u2022 Re-examine CNS often; chart BP, pupils, and GCS (p788). Repeat CT if deteriorating.\n  \n\u2022 Maintain cerebral perfusion by keeping well hydrated, but aim for SBP <160mmHg.\n  \n\u2022 Nimodipine (60mg/4h PO for 3wks, or 1mg/h IVI) is a Ca\n2+ antagonist that reduces \nvasospasm and consequent morbidity from cerebral ischaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Surgery: endovascular coiling vs surgical clipping (requiring craniotomy): the \ndecision depends on the accessibility and size of the aneurysm, though coiling \nis preferred where possible (fewer complications, better outcomes). Do catheter \nor CT angiography to identify single vs multiple aneurysms before intervening. \nNewer techniques such as balloon remodelling and \ufb02 ow diversion can be helpful \nin anatomically challenging aneurysms.\nComplications Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death, and occurs in 20%, \noften in the 1st few days. Cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm may cause a perma-\nnent CNS de\ufb01 cit, and is the commonest cause of morbidity. If this happens, surgery \nis not helpful at the time but may be so later. Hydrocephalus, due to blockage of \narachnoid granulations, requires a ventricular or lumbar drain. Hyponatraemia is \ncommon but should not be managed with \ufb02 uid restriction.
