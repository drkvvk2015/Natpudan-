Identify the underlying rhythm and treat \naccordingly.6\nDiff erential diagnosis (See p128.)\n  \n\u2022 Ventricular tachycardia (VT) including torsade de pointes. Single ventricular \nectopics should not cause confusion; if >3 together at a rate >100, this is VT.\n  \u2022 SVT (p806) with aberrant conduction, eg AF or atrial \ufb02 utter, with bundle branch block.\n  \n\u2022 Pre-excited tachycardias, eg AF, atrial \ufb02 utter, or AV re-entry tachycardia, with un-\nderlying WPW (p133).\nIdentifying the underlying rhythm (See p128.) \ue022If in doubt, treat as VT.\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.9.6\n  \n\u2022 Connect patient to a cardiac monitor and have a de\ufb01 brillator to hand.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor O2 sats and if <90% give supplemental oxygen.\n  \n\u2022 Correct electrolyte abnormalities, esp K\n+ and Mg\n2+.\n  \n\u2022 Check for adverse signs. Low cardiac output (clammy, \ue001consciousness, BP <90); \noliguria; angina; pulmonary oedema.\n  \n\u2022 Obtain 12-lead ECG (request CXR) and obtain IV access.\nIf haemodynamically unstable VT: \ue022Synchronized DC shock (see p894, \ufb01 g A3).\n  \n\u2022 Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h, \nand 4mL 50% magnesium sulfate over 30min both via central line.\n  \n\u2022 Follow with amiodarone 300mg IV over 10\u201320min (peripherally only in emergency).\n  \n\u2022 For refractory cases consider procainamide or sotalol.\nIf haemodynamically stable VT: Correct hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: as above.\n  \n\u2022 Amiodarone 300mg IV over 20\u201360min (avoid if long QT) via central line.\n  \n\u2022 If this fails, use synchronized DC shock.\nAfter correction of VT: Establish the cause (via the history and tests described above).\n  \n\u2022 Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give \nIV amiodarone infusion for 12\u201324h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic: \nsotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function).\n  \n\u2022 Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an \nimplantable cardioverter de\ufb01 brillator (ICD) may help.\nVentricular \ufb01 brillation: (ECG p129, \ufb01 g 3.29) Use non-synchronized DC shock (there is \nno R wave to trigger de\ufb01 brillation, p770): see p894, \ufb01 g A3.\nIf SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine (see p806).\nVentricular extrasystoles (ectopics): These are the commonest post-MI arrhyth-\nmia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent \nectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhyth-\nmic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.\nTorsade de pointes: A form of VT, with a constantly varying axis, often in the setting \nof long QT syndromes (ECG p129, \ufb01 g 3.31). Causes (p711): congenital or from drugs (eg \nsome antidysrhythmics, tricyclics, antimalarials, antipsychotics). Torsade in the set-\nting of congenital long-QT syndromes can be treated with high doses of \ue020-blockers.\nIn acquired long-QT syndromes (p711), stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypo-\nkalaemia, and give magnesium sulfate (2g IV over 10min). Alternatives include: over-\ndrive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or isoprenaline IVI to increase \nheart rate.", "text_length": 3357, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 812/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 811, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.588211", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.589140", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
