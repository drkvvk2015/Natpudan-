The usual site is \nthe radial artery at the wrist. \n\ue007Check with the patient that \nthey do not have an arterio-\nvenous \ufb01 stula for haemodial-\nysis. Never, ever sample from \na \ufb01 stula.\nProcedure:\n  \n\u2022 Get kit ready; include: port-\nable sharps bin; pre-heparin-\nized syringe; needle (blue size \n(23G) is good, although many \nsyringes now come pre-made with needle); gloves; 2% chlorhexidine/70% alco-\nhol swab; gauze; tape.\n  \n\u2022 Feel thoroughly for the best site. Look at both sides.\n  \n\u2022 Wipe with cleaning swab. Let the area dry. Get yourself comfortable.\n  \n\u2022 If the patient is drowsy or unconscious, ask an assistant to hold the hand and \narm with the wrist slightly extended (\ufb01 g 18.12).\n  \n\u2022 Before sampling, expel any excess heparin in the syringe. In\ufb01 ltration over the \nartery with a small amount of 1% lidocaine (p573) through a 25G (orange) needle \nmakes the procedure painless.\n  \n\u2022 Hold the syringe like a pen, with the needle bevel up. Let the patient know you \nare about to take the sample. Feel for the pulse with your other hand and enter \nat 45\u00b0, aiming beneath the \ufb01 nger you are feeling with.\n  \n\u2022 In most syringes, the plunger will move up on its own in a pulsatile manner if \nyou are in the artery; rarely, entry into a vein next to the artery will give a similar \nresult. Colour of the blood is little guide to its source.\n  \n\u2022 Allow the syringe to \ufb01 ll with \n1\u20132mL, then remove the needle \nand apply \ufb01 rm pressure for 5 \nminutes (10 if anticoagulated).\n  \n\u2022 Expel any air from the syringe \nas this will alter the oxygen-\nation of the blood. Cap and \nlabel the sample, check the \npatient\u2019s temperature and FiO2 \n(0.21 if on air). Take the sample \nto the nearest analysis ma-\nchine or send it by express de-\nlivery to the lab (which may be \nby your own feet, get someone \nelse to apply pressure) as it should be analysed within 15 minutes of sampling.\n  \n\u2022 Syringes and analysis machines diff er, so get familiar with the local nuances.\nThe other site that is amenable to ABG sampling is the femoral artery (\ufb01 g 18.13). \nSurprisingly this may be less uncomfortable as it is a relatively less sensitive area \nand because, when supine, the patient cannot see the needle and thus may feel less \napprehensive. The brachial artery can also be used, but be aware that the median \nnerve sits closely on its medial side and it is an end-artery. Normal values: p753.\nTaking arterial blood gas (ABG) samples\nFig 18.12 The ideal position for the wrist, slightly hyperex-\ntended, resting on an unopened litre bag of \ufb02 uid or a band-\nage is ideal. In an unconscious patient or for arterial line \ninsertion, taping the thumb to the bed can hold the wrist in \nthe perfect position if you do not have an assistant.\nFig 18.13 The femoral artery is amenable to ABG \nsampling.", "text_length": 3068, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 779/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 778, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.524014", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.525419", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
