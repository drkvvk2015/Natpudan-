The chief feature of PAD is \nintermittent claudication (= to limp). Prevalence = 10%.\nSymptoms Cramping pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock after walking for a given \ndistance (the claudication distance) and relieved by rest (calf claudication suggests \nfemoral disease while buttock claudication suggests iliac disease). Ulceration, gan-\ngrene (p660), and foot pain at rest\u2014eg burning pain at night relieved by hanging legs \nover side of bed\u2014are the cardinal features of critical ischaemia. Buttock claudica-\ntion \u00b1 impotence imply Leriche\u2019s syndrome (p704). Young, heavy smokers are at risk \nfrom Buerger\u2019s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans, p696).\nFontaine classi\ufb01 cation for PAD: 1 Asymptomatic. 2 Intermittent claudication. 3 Is-\nchaemic rest pain. 4 Ulceration/gangrene (critical ischaemia).\nSigns Absent femoral, popliteal, or foot pulses; cold, white leg(s); atrophic skin; \npunched out ulcers (often painful); postural/dependent colour change; Buerger\u2019s an-\ngle (angle that leg goes pale when raised off  the couch) of <20\u00b0 and capillary \ufb01 lling \ntime >15s are found in severe ischaemia.\nTests Exclude DM, arteritis (ESR/CRP). FBC (anaemia, polycythaemia); U&E (renal dis-\nease); lipids (dyslipidaemia); ECG (cardiac ischaemia). Do thrombophilia screen and \nserum homocysteine if <50 years. Ankle\u2013brachial pressure index (ABPI): Normal = \n1\u20131.2; PAD = 0.5\u20130.9; critical limb ischaemia <0.5 or ankle systolic pressure <50mmHg. \nBeware falsely high results from incompressible calci\ufb01 ed vessels in severe athero-\nsclerosis, eg DM.\nImaging Colour duplex US 1st line. If considering intervention MR/CT angiography \n(\ufb01 g 13.54) for extent and location of stenoses and quality of distal vessels (\u2018run-off \u2019).\n\ue014 1 Risk factor modi\ufb01 cation: Quit smoking (vital). Treat hypertension and high choles-\nterol. Prescribe an antiplatelet agent (unless contraindicated), to prevent progression \nand to reduce cardiovascular risk. Clopidogrel is recommended as 1st-line.\n2 Management of claudication: \u2022Supervised exercise programmes reduce symp-\ntoms by improving collateral blood \ufb02 ow (2h per wk for 3 months). Encourage patients \nto excercise to the point of maximal pain. \u2022Vasoactive drugs, eg naftidrofuryl oxa-\nlate, off er modest bene\ufb01 t and are recommended only in those who do not wish to \nundergo revascularization and if exercise fails to improve symptoms.\nIf conservative measures have failed and PAD is severely aff ecting a patient\u2019s life-\nstyle or becoming limb-threatening, intervention is required.\n  \n\u2022 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is used for disease limited to a sin-\ngle arterial segment (a balloon is in\ufb02 ated in the narrowed segment). 5-year paten-\ncy is 79% (iliac) and 55% (femoral). Stents can be used to maintain artery patency.\n  \n\u2022 Surgical reconstruction: If atheromatous disease is extensive but distal run-off  is \ngood (ie distal arteries \ufb01 lled by collateral vessels), consider arterial reconstruction \nwith a bypass graft (\ufb01 g 13.54). Procedures include femoral\u2013popliteal bypass, femo-\nral\u2013femoral crossover, and aorto\u2013bifemoral bypass grafts. Autologous vein grafts \nare superior to prosthetic grafts (eg Dacron\u00ae or PTFE) when the knee joint is crossed.\n  \n\u2022 Amputation <3% of patients with intermittent claudication require major am-\nputation within 5 years (\ue000 in diabetes, p212). Amputation may relieve intractable \npain and death from sepsis and gangrene. A decision to amputate must be made \nby the patient, usually against a background of failed alternative strategies. The \nknee should be preserved where possible as it improves mobility and rehabilitation \npotential (this must be balanced with the need to ensure wound healing). Rehabili-\ntation should be started early with a view to limb \ufb01 tting. Gabapentin (regimen on \np504) can be used to treat the gruelling complication of phantom limb pain.\n  \n\u2022 Future therapies: Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and \nbene\ufb01 t of gene therapy (eg hepatocyte growth factor) in critical limb ischaemia.", "text_length": 4444, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 664/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 663, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.313568", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.314130", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
