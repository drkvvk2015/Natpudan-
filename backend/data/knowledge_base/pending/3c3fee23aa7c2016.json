As Michelangelo foretold (in his \nCreation of Adam) \u2018all gods and demons that have ever existed are within us as possibilities, de-\nsires, and ways of escape\u2019. Within the dark red vault of our skull we see human and god-like forms \nreaching out, as thoughts escape into actions\u2014with legs extending into our brainstem (B) and a \n\ufb01 st is pushing from our hypothalamus into the pituitary stalk (P). Above the pituitary we have \nthoughts, ideas, impulses, and neurotransmitters. Below we have hormones. Between is the realm \nof neuroendocrinology\u2014the neurosecretory cells which turn emotions into the releasing factors \nfor the pituitary hormones (\ufb01 g 5.4).\nImage courtesy of Gary Bevans; quote from Frank Lynn Meshberger.
