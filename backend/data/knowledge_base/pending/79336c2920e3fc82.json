Imaging: bone scintigraphy; CT.\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n95\nCardiovascular medicine\nOn acute wards we are always hearing questions such as \u2018Is your pain sharp or \ndull?\u2019, followed by an equivocal answer. The doctor goes on: \u2018Sharp like a knife\u2014or \ndull and crushing?\u2019 The doctor is getting irritated because the patient must know \nthe answer but is not saying it. A true story paves the way to being less inquisito-\nrial and having a more creative understanding of the nature of symptoms.\nA patient came to a previous OHCM author saying \u2018Last night I dreamed I had a \npain in my chest. Now I\u2019ve woken up, and I\u2019m not sure\u2014have I got chest pain, \ndoctor? What do you think?\u2019 How odd it is to be asked to examine a patient to \nexclude a symptom, not a disease. (It turned out that she did have serious chest \npathology.) Odd, until one realizes that symptoms are often half-formed, and it \nis our role to give them a local habitation and a name. Dialogue can transform a \nsymptom from \u2018airy nothingness\u2019 to a fact. \n2\nPatients often avoid using the word \u2018pain\u2019 to describe ischaemia: \u2018wind\u2019, \u2018tighten-\ning\u2019, \u2018pressure\u2019, \u2018burning\u2019, or \u2018a lump in the throat\u2019 (angina means to choke) may \nbe used. They may say \u2018sharp\u2019 to communicate severity, and not character. So be \nas vague in your questioning as your patient is in their answers. \u2018Tell me some \nmore about what you are feeling (long pause) \u2026 as if someone was doing what to \nyou?\u2019 \u2018Sitting on me\u2019 or \u2018like a hotness\u2019 might be the response (suggesting cardiac \nischaemia). Do not ask \u2018Does it go into your left arm\u2019. Try \u2018Is there anything else \nabout it?\u2019 (pause) \u2026 \u2018Does it go anywhere?\u2019 Note down your patient\u2019s exact words.\nA good history, taking account of these features, is the best way to stratify pa-\ntients likely to have cardiac pain. If the history is non-speci\ufb01 c, there are no risk fac-\ntors for cardiovascular diseases, and ECG and plasma troponin T (p118) are normal \n6\u201312h after the onset of pain, discharge will probably be OK. 4 When in doubt, get \nhelp. Features making cardiac pain unlikely:\n  \n\u2022 Stabbing, shooting pain.\n  \n\u2022 Pain lasting <30s, however intense.\n  \n\u2022 Well-localized, left sub-mammary pain (\u2018In my heart, doctor\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 Pains of continually varying location.\n  \n\u2022 Youth.\nDo not feel that you must diagnose every pain. Chest pain with no cause is com-\nmon, even after extensive tests. Some patients have a \u2018chronic pain syndrome\u2019 \nsimilar to post-herpetic neuralgia. Typically, this responds to a tricyclic, eg low-\ndose amitriptyline at night (this dose does not imply any depression).\nAvoid being that doctor who triumphantly tells a patient that they are \ufb01 ne and \ncan go home, only to be met by a glare, as the disabling pain the patient presented \nwith is no better than when they arrived. Take time to explain why you do not \nbelieve the pain is a result of dangerous pathology; to give advice on pain control \nand \u2018red \ufb02 ags\u2019; and to reassure the patient that their problem is likely to resolve \nwith time.\nChest pain from the patient\u2019s perspective\n2 Dialogue-transformed symptoms explain one of the junior doctor\u2019s main vexations: when patients retell \nsymptoms to a consultant in the light of day, they bear no resemblance to what you originally heard. But do \nnot be vexed: your dialogue may have helped the patient far more than any ward round.", "text_length": 3353, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 107/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 106, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.044099", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.044822", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
