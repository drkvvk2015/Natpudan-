Signs: A few weeks after an in-\nfection a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness starts. Triggers: Campylobacter \njejuni, CMV, mycoplasma, zoster, HIV, EBV, vaccinations. The trigger causes antibodies \nwhich attack nerves. In 40%, no cause is found. It may advance quickly, aff ecting all \nlimbs at once, and can lead to paralysis. There is a progressive phase of up to 4 weeks, \nfollowed by recovery. Unlike other neuropathies, proximal muscles are more aff ected, \neg trunk, respiratory, and cranial nerves (esp. VII). Pain is common (eg back, limb) but \nsensory signs may be absent. Autonomic dysfunction: Sweating, \ue000pulse, BP changes, \narrhythmias. Nerve conduction studies: Slow conduction. CSF: \ue000Protein (eg >5.5g/L), \nnormal CSF white cell count. Respiratory involvement (the big danger) requires trans-\nfer to ITU. Do forced vital capacity (FVC) 4-hourly. \ue007Ventilate sooner rather than \nlater, eg if FVC <1.5L, PaO2 <10kPa, PaCO2 >6kPa. \ue057: IV immunoglobulin 0.4g/kg/24h for \n5d. Plasma exchange is good too (?more SE).45 Steroids have no role. Prognosis: Good; \n~85% make a complete or near-complete recovery. 10% are unable to walk alone \nat 1yr. Complete paralysis is compatible with complete recovery. Mortality: 10%. \n \nGeorge C Guillain, 1876\u20131961; Jean-Alexandre Barr\u00e9, 1880\u20131967 (French neurologists)\nHenoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) (\ufb01 g 15.5) A small vessel vasculitis, presenting \nwith purpura (non-blanching purple papules due to intradermal bleeding), often \nover buttocks and extensor surfaces, typically aff ecting young \ue032.

It presents as purple papules (\u00bd\u20131cm) or plaques on skin (\ufb01 g 15.7) and mucosa \n(look in mouth, but any organ). It metastasizes to nodes. There are four types: 1 Clas-\nsic, a rare disease of the elderly. 2 Endemic, a disease of children documented prior \nto HIV. 3 Iatrogenic KS due to immunosuppression, eg organ transplant recipients. \n4 AIDS-associated KS. Usually presents with low CD4 count and can indicate failure \nof HAART (p402). However \u2153 presents in HIV with near normal CD4 counts and an \nundetectable viral load. Initiation of HAART with rapid immune system constitution \ncan precipitate KS. Lung KS may present in HI V +ve men and women as dyspnoea and \nhaemoptysis. Bowel KS may cause nausea, abdominal pain. Rare sites: CNS, larynx, \neye, glands, heart, breast, wounds, or biopsy sites. \ue031: Biopsy. \ue057: Optimize HAART, local \nradiotherapy, surgical excision, intralesional therapy (vincristine, bleomycin), topical \nretinoids, interferon alfa, interleukin-12. Current research includes thalidomide, VEGF \nmonoclonal antibodies, and sirolimus. \nMoricz Kaposi, 1837\u20131902 (Hungarian dermatologist)", "text_length": 4755, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 710/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 709, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.390659", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.391534", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
