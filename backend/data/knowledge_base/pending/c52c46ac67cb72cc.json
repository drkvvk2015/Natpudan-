Previous angina, relief with rest/nitrates, history of cardio-\nvascular disease, risk factors for IHD.\nExamination: (See p38.) Pulse, BP, JVP, cardiac murmurs, signs of heart failure, pe-\nripheral pulses, scars from previous cardiac surgery.\nInvestigations ECG: ST depression; \ufb02 at or inverted T-waves; or normal; FBC, U&E, tro-\nponin, glucose, random cholesterol; CXR.\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.6 for acute management, but p796 if ST elevation. The aim \nof therapy is to control pain then initiate anti-ischaemic and antiplatelet therapy.\nOral antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 300mg PO, followed by 75mg OD. For those with \ncon\ufb01 rmed ACS give a second antiplatelet agent, eg clopidogrel (300mg PO then 75mg \nOD PO). Ticagrelor (180mg then 90mg/12h PO) is a prefered alternative, particularly in \nhigher risk groups5 (eg \u2022 \u226560yrs age \u2022previous stroke, TIA, MI, or CABG \u2022known coro-\nnary artery stenosis \u226550% in \u22652 vessels or carotid stenosis \u226550% \u2022DM \u2022peripheral \narterial disease \u2022chronic kidney disease). Prasugrel (60mg then 10mg/d PO) is an \nalternative to clopidogrel for those undergoing PCI. In practice, if the history is typi-\ncal but ECG changes are non-diagnostic and troponin results are awaited, treatment \nwith eg clopridogrel is often given on clinical suspicion; if troponin testing then con-\n\ufb01 rms ACS, it is still appropriate to give either ticagrelor or prasugrel to those patients \nin whom it is indicated, even if clopidogrel has already been given.\nAnticoagulation: Ideally fondaparinux (factor Xa inhibitor) 2.5mg OD; if not avail-\nable, use low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, eg enoxaparin 1mg/kg/12h) or un-\nfractionated heparin (aim APTT 50\u201370s) until discharge.\n\u00df-blockers: In higher-risk patients with no contraindications (consider diltiazem \nas alternative). \ue007Do not use \ue020-blockers with verapamil\u2014can precipitate asystole.\nNitrates (PO or IV): For recurrent chest pain.\nACE-i: Should be given to all patients unless there are CI (monitor renal function).\nLipid management: Start early, eg atorvastatin 80mg OD (see p120).\nPrognosis Overall risk of death ~1\u20132%, but ~15% for refractory angina despite medi-\ncal therapy. Risk strati\ufb01 cation can help predict those most at risk and allow interven-\ntion to be targeted at those individuals: calculate using GRACE score.\n2 The following \nare associated with an increased risk:\n  \n\u2022 History of unstable angina.\n  \n\u2022 ST depression or widespread T-wave inversion.\n  \n\u2022 Raised troponin (except patients with ST elevation MI).\n  \n\u2022 Age >70 years.\n  \n\u2022 General comorbidity, previous MI, poor LV function or DM.\n\ue007High-risk patients should be considered for inpatient coronary angiography. Symp-\ntomatic lesions may be addressed by coronary stenting or CABG (see p123).\nFurther measures\n  \n\u2022 Wean off  glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion when stabilized on oral drugs.\n  \n\u2022 Continue fondaparinux (or LMWH or heparin) until discharge.\n  \n\u2022 Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia. Check serial ECGS, \nand troponin >12h after pain.\n  \n\u2022 Address modi\ufb01 able risk factors: smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes.\n  \n\u2022 Gentle mobilization.\n  \n\u2022 Ensure patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, \ue020-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin.\n\ue007If symptoms recur, refer to cardiologist for urgent angiography & PCI or CABG.\n2 GRACE = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Risk is scored based on age, heart rate, BP, re-\nnal function, Killip class of heart failure, and other events, eg raised troponin. Very complicated \nto calculate so recommendation by European Society of Cardiology is to use an online calculator, \neg http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/.", "text_length": 3969, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 806/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 805, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.577737", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.578514", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
