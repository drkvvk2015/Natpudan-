Specialist advice is vital. \nIt should only be considered if the patient is likely to become malnourished with-\nout it\u2014this normally means that the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning (eg \nbowel obstruction), and is unlikely to function for at least 7d. Parenteral feeding may \nsupplement other forms of nutrition (eg in short bowel syndrome or active Crohn\u2019s \ndisease, when nutrition cannot be suffi  ciently absorbed in the gut) or it can be used \nalone (total parenteral nutrition\u2014TPN). \ue007Even if there is GI disease, studies show that \nenteral nutrition is safer, cheaper, and at least as effi  cacious as parenteral nutrition \nin the perioperative period.\n5\nAdministration Nutrition must be given via a dedicated central venous line (or \nperipherally inserted central catheter\u2014PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi-\nlumen catheter (see \ufb01 gs 13.9 and 13.10).\nRequirements There are many diff erent regimens for parenteral feeding. Most \nprovide 2000kCal and 10\u201314g nitrogen in 2\u20133L; this usually meets a patient\u2019s daily \nrequirements (see table 13.6, p585). ~50% of calories are provided by fat and ~50% \nby carbohydrate. Regimens comprise vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and elec-\ntrolytes; these will normally be included by the pharmacist.\nComplications\n  \n\u2022 Sepsis: (eg Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus; Candida; \nPseudomonas; infective endocarditis.) Look for spiking pyrexia and examine \nwound at tube insertion point. Stop PN, take line and peripheral cultures and give \nantibiotics via the line. If central venous line-related sepsis is suspected, the safest \ncourse of action is always to remove the line. Do not attempt to salvage a line when \nStaph. aureus or Candida infection has been identi\ufb01 ed.\n  \n\u2022 Thrombosis: Central vein thrombosis may occur, resulting in pulmonary embolus \nor superior vena caval obstruction (p528).\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic imbalance: Electrolyte abnormalities\u2014see BOX \u2018Refeeding syndrome\u2019; \nderanged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; de\ufb01 ciency syndromes (table 6.9, p268); \nacid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production).\n  \n\u2022 Mechanical: Pneumothorax; embolism of IV line tip.\nGuidelines for success\n\ue007Liaise closely with line insertion team, nutrition team, and pharmacist.\n  \n\u2022 Meticulous sterility. Do not use central venous lines for uses other than nutrition. \nRemove the line if you suspect infection. Culture its tip.\n  \n\u2022 Review \ufb02 uid balance at least twice daily, and requirements for energy and elec-\ntrolytes daily.\n  \n\u2022 Check weight, \ufb02 uid balance, and urine glucose daily during establishment of par-\nenteral nutrition. Check plasma glucose, creatinine and electrolytes (including cal-\ncium and phosphate), and FBC daily until stable. Check LFT and lipid clearance three \ntimes a week until stable. Check zinc and magnesium weekly.\n  \n\u2022 Do not rush. Achieve the maintenance regimen in small steps.\n  \u2022 Treat underlying conditions vigorously\u2014eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance.\n5 Enteral feeding promotes integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin \ntranslocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a sys-\ntemic in\ufb02 ammatory response\u2014even when the gut is not the primary source of pathology.", "text_length": 3463, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 594/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 593, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.200565", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.202217", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
