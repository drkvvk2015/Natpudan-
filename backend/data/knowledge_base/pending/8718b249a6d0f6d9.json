Usually begins with a hyperthyroid\nphase followed by a hypothyroid phase. If patient has\npostpartum depression, consider this diagnosis and\nperform thyroid uptake study. Nursing mothers who\nhad the radioactive uptake study should pump and\ndump breast milk for 72 h before refeeding\nDIAGNOSIS\nonce hyperthyroidism is diagnosed\nduring pregnancy (high free T4, low TSH), the cause\nmay be difficult to establish. Postpartum follow up\nmay help. Thyroid radionuclide scan is contraindi\ncated in pregnant women.

PTU is\nthe anti thyroid agent of choice before and during\nthe first trimester (as methimazole is associated\nwith fetal abnormalities during this period), while\nmethimazole should be used for the remainder of\nthe pregnancy. Use the lowest dose of PTU possi\nble.
