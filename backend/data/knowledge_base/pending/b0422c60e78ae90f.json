The meningococcal en-\ndotoxin acts as a potent initiator of in\ufb02 ammatory and coagulation cascades. Other \ncauses include H. in\ufb02 uenzae, pneumococcal, streptococcal, and staphylococcal sep-\nsis. Adrenal failure causes shock, as normal vascular tone requires cortisol to set \nactivity of \ue025- and \ue020-adrenergic receptors, and aldosterone is needed to maintain \nextracellular \ufb02 uid volume. Treatment: \ue022Antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (p822) and hy-\ndrocortisone 200mg/4h IV for adrenal support. ICU admission. \n \n \n \nRupert Waterhouse, 1873\u20131958 (British physician); Carl Friderichsen, 1886\u20131979 (Danish paediatrician)\nWeber\u2019s syndrome (Superior alternating hemiplegia.) Ipsilateral oculomotor \nnerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia, due to infarction of one-half of the mid-\nbrain, after occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar or posterior cerebral \narteries. \nHerman David Weber, 1823\u20131918 (German-born physician whose son described Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome)\nWegener\u2019s granulomatosis This has been renamed granulomatosis with poly-\nangiitis (GPA), in part because of concerns over the suitability of Friedrich Wegener, \na member of the Nazi party during WWII, to be the source of an eponym. GPA is a mul-\ntisystem disorder of unknown cause character ized by necrotizing granulomatous \nin\ufb02 ammation and vasculitis of small and medium vessels. It has a predilection for \nthe upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. Features: Upper airways disease is \ncommon, with nasal obstruction, ulcers, epistaxis, or destruction of the nasal septum \ncausing a characteristic \u2018saddle-nose\u2019 deformity.\n6 Sinusitis is often a feature. Re-\nnal disease causes rapidly progressive glom erulo nephritis with crescent formation, \nproteinuria, or haematuria. Pulmonary involvement may cause cough, haemoptysis \n(severe if pulmonary haemorrhage), or pleuritis. There may also be skin purpura or \nnodules, peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, arthritis/arthralgia, or ocu-\nlar involvement, eg keratitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, uveitis. Tests: CANCA \ndirected against PR3 is most speci\ufb01 c and raised in the majority of patients (p553). \nSome patients express PANCA speci\ufb01 c for MPO. \ue000ESR/CRP. Urinalysis should be per-\nformed to look for proteinuria or haematuria. If these are present, consider a renal \nbiopsy. CXR may show nodules \u00b1 \ufb02 uff y in\ufb01 ltrates of pulmonary haemorrhage. CT may \nreveal diff use alveolar haemorrhage. Atypical cells from cytology of sputum/BAL \ncan be confused with bronchial carcinoma.66 Treatment: Depends on the extent of \ndisease. Severe disease (eg biopsy-proven renal disease) should be treated with cor-\nticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (or rituximab) to induce remission. Azathioprine \nand methotrexate are usually used as maintenance. Indications for plasma exchange \ninclude patients presenting with severe renal disease (eg creatinine >500\u03bcmol/L) and \nthose with pulmonary haemorrhage. Co-trimoxazole should be given as prophylaxis \nagainst Pneumocystis jirovecii and staphylococcal colonization.\n \nFriedrich Wegener, 1907\u20131990 (German pathologist)\nWernicke\u2019s encephalopathy Thiamine (vitamin B1) de\ufb01 ciency with a classical \ntriad of 1 confusion 2 ataxia and 3 ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus, lateral rectus, or \nconjugate gaze palsies). There is inadequate dietary intake, \ue001GI absorption, and \nimpaired utilization of thiamine resulting in focal areas of brain damage, including \nperiaqueductal punctate haemorrhages (mechanism unclear). Always consider this \ndiagnosis in alcoholics: it may also present with memory disturbance, hypotension, \nhypothermia, or reduced consciousness.67 Recognized causes: Chronic alcoholism, \neating disorders, malnutrition, prolonged vomiting, eg with chemotherapy, GI malig-\nnancy, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Diagnosis: Primarily clinical. Red cell transketo-\nlase activity is decreased (rarely done). Treatment: Urgent replacement to prevent \nirreversible Korsakoff \u2019s syndrome (p704). Give thiamine (Pabrinex\u00ae), 2 pairs of high-\npotency ampoules IV/IM/8h over 30min for 2d, then 1 pair OD for a further 5d. Oral \nsupplementation (100mg OD) should continue until no longer \u2018at risk\u2019 (+ give other B \nvitamins). Anaphylaxis is rare. If there is coexisting hypoglycaemia (often the case in \nthis group of patients), make sure thiamine is given before glucose, as Wernicke\u2019s can \nbe precipitated by glucose administration to a thiamine-de\ufb01 cient patient. Prognosis: \nUntreated, death occurs in 20%, and Korsakoff \u2019s psychosis occurs in 85%\u2014a quarter \nof whom will require long-term institutional care. \nKarl Wernicke, 1848\u20131905 (German neurologist)", "text_length": 4937, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 722/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 721, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.413018", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.414002", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
