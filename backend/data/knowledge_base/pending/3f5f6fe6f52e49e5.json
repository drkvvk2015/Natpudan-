This leads to retrograde \ufb02 ow \nin pulmonary veins, and \ue001cardiac output, dyspnoea, palpitations, malaise, and even \nsyncope.\nPacemaker-mediated tachycardia: Retrograde conduction to the atrium is \nsensed by the pacemaker and ventricular pacing delivered in response. This again \ncauses retrograde atrial conduction causing a repetitive sensing/pacing loop. This \ncan be \ufb01 xed by changing pacing programming parameters.\nSome pacemaker terms\nFig 3.36 ECG of a paced rhythm.\nAs well as the many acquired conditions that can predispose to arrhythmias \n(p125), there are a number of congenital conditions. These may be clinically silent \nuntil a fatal attack and are likely to be responsible for most cases of sudden adult \ndeath syndrome (SADS). They include:\nWPW syndrome (Wolff -Parkinson-White; \ufb01 g 3.37.) Caused by congenital acces-\nsory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short \nPR interval, wide QRS complex (due to slurred upstroke or \u2018delta wave\u2019) and ST-T \nchanges. Two types: WPW type A (+ve \ue008 wave in V1), WPW type B (\u03a9ve \ue008 wave in V1). \nTachycardia can be due to an AVRT or pre-excited AF/atrial \ufb02 utter (p130). Manage-\nment may include ablation of the accessory pathway.\nLQTS (Long QT syndromes.) These are channelopathies that result in prolonged \nrepolarization phases, predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias; classi-\ncally torsades de pointes. \ue007p804. Conditions associated with LQTS include Jervell \nand Lange-Nielsen syndrome (p702) and Romano\u2013Ward syndrome (p710).\nARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.) RV myocardium is re-\nplaced with \ufb01 bro-fatty material. Symptoms: palpitations and syncope during ex-\nercise. ECG changes include epsilon wave; T inversion and broad QRS in V1\u2013V3.\nBrugada Sodium channelopathy. Diagnosis: classic coved ST elevation in V1\u2013V3 plus \nsuggestive clinical history. ECG changes and arrhythmias can be precipitated by \nfever, medications (www.brugadadrugs.org), electrolyte imbalances, and ischaemia.\nMany of these patients can be treated medically or conservatively but those at \nhigh risk may require an implantable cardiac de\ufb01 brillator (ICD). Screening family \nmembers is important for picking up undiagnosed cases.\nCongenital arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions\nFig 3.37 This patient has Wolff -Parkinson-White syndrome as they have delta waves (slurred QRS \nupstrokes) in beats 1 and 4 of this rhythm strip.
