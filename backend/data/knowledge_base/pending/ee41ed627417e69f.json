People who improve \nand maintain their \ufb01 tness live longer: \ue007age-adjusted mortality from all causes \nis reduced by >40%. Avoiding obesity helps too, but weight loss per se is only \nuseful in reducing cardiovascular risk and the risk of developing diabetes when \ncombined with regular exercise. Moderate alcohol drinking may also promote \ncardiovascular health.\nHypertension is the chief risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, followed by \nsmoking. Giving up smoking, even after many years, does bring bene\ufb01 t. Simple ad-\nvice works. Most smokers want to give up. Just because smoking advice does not \nalways work, do not stop giving it. Ask about smoking in consultations\u2014especially \nthose regarding smoking-related diseases.\n  \n\u2022 Ensure advice is congruent with the patient\u2019s beliefs about smoking.\n  \n\u2022 Getting patients to enumerate the advantages of giving up \ue000 motivation.\n  \n\u2022 Invite the patient to choose a date (when there will be few stresses) on which he \nor she will become a non-smoker.\n  \n\u2022 Suggest throwing away all accessories (cigarettes, pipes, ash trays, lighters, \nmatches) in advance; inform friends of the new change; practise saying \u2018no\u2019 to \ntheir off ers of \u2018just one little cigarette\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 Nicotine gum, chewed intermittently to limit nicotine release: \u2265 ten 2mg sticks \nmay be needed/day. Transdermal nicotine patches may be easier. A dose in-\ncrease at 1wk can help. Written advice off ers no added bene\ufb01 t to advice from \nnurses. Always off er follow-up.\n  \n\u2022 Varenicline is an oral selective nicotine receptor partial agonist. Start 1wk be-\nfore target stop date and gradually increase the dose. SES: appetite change; dry \nmouth; taste disturbance; headache; drowsiness; dizziness; sleep disorders; ab-\nnormal dreams; depression; suicidal thoughts; panic; dysarthria.\n  \n\u2022 Bupropion (=amfebutamone) is said to \ue000 quit rate to 30% at 1yr vs 16% with \npatches and 15.6% for placebo (patches + bupropion: 35.5%): 1 consider if the \nabove fails. Warn of SES: seizures (risk <1:1000), insomnia, headache.\nLipids and diabetes (pp690, 206) are the other major modi\ufb01 able risk factors. The \nQRISK2 score (www.qrisk.org) is used in the UK to integrate a patient\u2019s diff erent car-\ndiovascular risk factors in order to predict future cardiovascular health.2 It can be \nused as part of a consultation on lifestyle factors to show patients that address-\ning certain risk factors (eg smoking, BP) will reduce their risk of MIs and strokes.\n\ue007Apply preventive measures such as healthy eating (p244) early in life to maxim-\nize impact, when there are most years to save, and before bad habits get ingrained.\nCardiovascul a r health\nCardiovascular medicine has an unrivalled treasure house of randomized trials. \nOne of the chief pleasures of cardiovascular medicine lies in integrating these \nwith clinical reasoning in a humane way. After a cardiac event, a protocol may \n\u2018mandate\u2019 statins, aspirin, \ue020-blockers, ACE-i (p114), and a target BP and LDL choles-\nterol that makes your patient feel dreadful. What to do? Inform, negotiate, and \ncompromise. Never reject your patient because of lack of compliance with your \nover-exacting regim ens. Keep smiling, keep communicating, and keep up to date: \nthe latest data may show that your patient was right all along.3 \nThe randomized trial", "text_length": 3873, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 105/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 104, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.040349", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.042205", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
