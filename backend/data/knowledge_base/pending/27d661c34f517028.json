Over-produced cytokines and cellular \nprocesses erode cartilage and bone, and produce the systemic eff ects seen in RA.\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) are 1st line and should ideally \nbe started within 3 months of persistent symptoms. They can take 6\u201312 weeks for \nsymptomatic bene\ufb01 t. Best results are often achieved with a combination of meth-\notrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.23 Le\ufb02 unomide is another option.\n\ue007Immunosuppression is a potentially fatal SE of treatment (especially in combi-\nnation with methotrexate) which can result in pancytopenia, \ue000susceptibility to \ninfection (including atypical organisms), and neutropenic sepsis (p352). Regular \nFBC, LFT monitoring.24\nOther SE \u2022 Methotrexate\u2014pneumonitis (pre treatment CXR), oral ulcers, hepa-\ntotoxicity, teratogenic. \u2022 Sulfasalazine\u2014rash, \ue001sperm count, oral ulcers, GI upset. \n\u2022 Le\ufb02 unomide\u2014teratogenicity (\ue032 and \ue033), oral ulcers, \ue000BP, hepatotoxicity. \u2022 Hydroxy-\nchloroquine\u2014can cause retinopathy; pre treatment and annual eye screen required.\nBiological agents and NICE guidance Initiated by specialists, for patients with \nactive disease despite adequate trial of at least 2 DMARDS. Pre treatment screening \nfor TB, hepatitis B/C, HIV essential.\n1 TNF\ue025 inhibitors: Eg in\ufb02 iximab (p265), etanercept, adalimumab, are approved by \nNICE as 1st-line agents. Where methotrexate is contraindicated, can be used as \nmonotherapy. Clinical response can be striking, with improved function and health \noutcomes, although response may be inadequate/unsustained.25\n2 B-cell depletion: Eg rituximab, used in combination with methotrexate and ap-\nproved by NICE for severe active RA where DMARDS and a TNF\ue025 blocker have failed.26\n3 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition: Eg tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker), approved by NICE \nin combination with methotrexate where TNF\ue025 blocker has failed (or is contraindi-\ncated).27 Monitor for hypercholesterolaemia.\n4 Inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation: Eg abatacept\u2014licensed for active RA where \npatients have not responded to DMARDS or TNF\ue025 blocker.28\nSide eff ects of biological agents Serious infection, reactivation of TB (\ue018 screen \nand consider prophylaxis) and hepatitis B; worsening heart failure; hypersensitiv-\nity; injection-site reactions and blood disorders. ANA and reversible SLE-type illness \nmay evolve. Data suggests there is no increased risk of solid organ tumours but \nskin cancers may be more common.29 TNF inhibitors do not appear to be associated \nwith a further increase in the already elevated lymphoma occurrence in RA.30\nIn\ufb02 uencing biological events in RA\nTable 12.4 Criteria for diagnosing RA22\nWhen to suspect RA?
