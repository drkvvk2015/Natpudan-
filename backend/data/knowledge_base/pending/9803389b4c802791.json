The diaphragm \ufb01 lters out \nlow pitches, making higher-pitched murmurs easier to detect (eg aortic regurgita-\ntion). NB: a bell applied tightly to the skin becomes a diaphragm.\n\ue007Consider any murmur in terms of character, timing, loudness, area where loudest, \nradiation, and accentuating manoeuvres.\n\ue007When in doubt, rely on echocardiography rather than disputed sounds. (But still \nenjoy trying to \ufb01 gure out the clinical conundrum!)\nCharacter and timing (See \ufb01 g 2.14.)\n  \n\u2022 An ejection-systolic murmur (ESM, crescendo\u2013decrescendo) usually originates \nfrom the out\ufb02 ow tract and waxes and wanes with the intraventricular pressures. \nESMS may be innocent and are common in children and high-output states (eg \ntachycardia, pregnancy). Organic causes include aortic stenosis and sclerosis, pul-\nmonary stenosis, and H(O)CM.\n  \n\u2022 A pansystolic murmur (PSM) is of uniform intensity and merges with S2. It is usu-\nally organic and occurs in mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (S1 may also be soft in \nthese), or a ventricular septal defect (p156). Mitral valve prolapse may produce a \nlate systolic murmur \u00b1 midsystolic click.\n  \n\u2022 Early diastolic murmurs (EDMs) are high pitched and easily missed: listen for the \n\u2018absence of silence\u2019 in early diastole. An EDM occurs in aortic and, though rare, pul-\nmonary regurgitation. If the pulmonary regurgitation is secondary to pulmonary \nhypertension resulting from mitral stenosis, then the EDM is called a Graham Steell \nmurmur.\n  \n\u2022 Mid-diastolic murmurs (MDMs) are low pitched and rumbling. They occur in mitral \nstenosis (accentuated presystolically if heart still in sinus rhythm), rheumatic fever \n(Carey Coombs\u2019 murmur: due to thickening of the mitral valve lea\ufb02 ets), and aortic \nregurgitation (Austin Flint murmur: due to the \ufb02 uttering of the anterior mitral \nvalve cusp caused by the regurgitant stream).\nIntensity All murmurs are graded on a scale of 1\u20136 (see table 2.4), though in practice \ndiastolic murmurs, being less loud, are only graded 1\u20134. Intensity is a poor guide to \nthe severity of a lesion\u2014an ESM may be inaudible in severe aortic stenosis.\nArea where loudest Though an unreliable sign, mitral murmurs tend to be loudest \nover the apex, in contrast to the area of greatest intensity from lesions of the aortic \n(right 2nd intercostal space), pulmonary (left 2nd intercostal space), and tricuspid \n(lower left sternal edge) valves.\nRadiation The ESM of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotids, in contrast \nto the PSM of mitral regurgitation, which radiates to the axilla.\nAccentuating manoeuvres\n  \n\u2022 Movements that bring the relevant part of the heart closer to the stethoscope ac-\ncentuate murmurs (eg leaning forward for aortic regurgitation, left lateral position \nfor mitral stenosis).\n  \n\u2022 Expiration increases blood \ufb02 ow to the left side of the heart and therefore accentu-\nates left-sided murmurs. Inspiration has the opposite eff ect.\n  \n\u2022 Valsalva manoeuvre (forced expiration against a closed glottis) decreases sys-\ntemic venous return, accentuating mitral valve prolapse and H(O)CM, but softening \nmitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Squatting has exactly the opposite eff ect. \nExercise accentuates the murmur of mitral stenosis.\nNon-valvular murmurs A pericardial friction rub may be heard in pericarditis. \nIt is a super\ufb01 cial scratching sound, not con\ufb01 ned to systole or diastole. Continuous \nmurmurs are present throughout the cardiac cycle and may occur with a patent \nductus arteriosus, arteriovenous \ufb01 stula, or ruptured sinus of Valsalva.", "text_length": 3952, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 58/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 57, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.958695", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.960274", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
