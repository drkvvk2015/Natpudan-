Fea-\ntures: small testes, \ue001libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of pubic hair, \ue001muscle bulk, \n\ue000fat, gynaecomastia, osteoporosis, \ue001mood. If prepubertal: \ue001virilization; incomplete \npuberty; eunuchoid body; reduced secondary sex characteristics. Causes include:\nPrimary hypogonadism is due to testicular failure, eg from \u2022local trauma, tor-\nsion, chemotherapy/irradiation \u2022post-orchitis, eg mumps, HIV, brucellosis, leprosy \n\u2022renal failure, liver cirrhosis, or alcohol excess (toxic to Leydig cells) \u2022chromosom-\nal abnormalities, eg Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome (47XXY)\u2014delayed sexual development, \nsmall testes, and gynaecomastia.
