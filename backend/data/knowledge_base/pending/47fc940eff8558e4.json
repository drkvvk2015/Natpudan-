Use an \nACE-i 1st line or angiotension receptor antagonist if intolerant. If hypertensive and \nunderlying renal involvement, see local guidance, p304.\nType 2 DM: Target BP <140/80mmHg or <130/80mmHg if kidney, eye, or cerebrovas-\ncular damage. 1st-line drug treatment should be an ACE-i, except in those of Afri-\ncan or Caribbean origin, where ACE-i plus diuretic or a calcium-channel antagonist \n(CCA) should be started.

Life may be transformed by \ncataract surgery, sildena\ufb01 l (unless contraindicated, p230), dietary negotiation, and \nsport (it needn\u2019t be shooting). Take steps to simplify care. Stop blood glucose \nself-monitoring if it\u2019s achieving nothing (known to \ue001 quality of life). Even if all these \ninterventions fail, you have one trump card up your sleeve: \u2018Let\u2019s both try to \ufb01 nd \none new thing of value before we next meet\u2014and compare notes\u2019.
