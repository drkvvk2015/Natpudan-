It may occur suddenly, or after progressively worsening heart failure.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Myocardial infarction (pp796\u20139).\n  \n\u2022 Arrhythmias (pp124\u201331).\n  \n\u2022 Pulmonary embolus (p818).\n  \n\u2022 Tension pneumothorax (p814).\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac tamponade (p154 and later in topic).\n  \n\u2022 Myocarditis; myocardial depression (drugs, hypoxia, acidosis, sepsis) (p152).\n  \n\u2022 Valve destruction (endocarditis\u2014p150).\n  \n\u2022 Aortic dissection (p655).\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.8.\n\ue022If the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital (see p796).\n  \n\u2022 Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU.\n  \n\u2022 Investigation and treatment may need to be done concurrently.\n  \n\u2022 Investigations: ECG, U&E, troponin, ABG, CXR, echocardiogram. If indicated, CT thorax \n(speak with radiologists, this can be protocolled for both aortic dissection and PE) .\n  \n\u2022 Monitor: CVP, BP, ABG, ECG, urine output. Keep on cardiac monitor/telemetry. Record \na 12-lead ECG every hour until the diagnosis is made. Consider a CVP line and an arte-\nrial line to monitor pressure, if these are in situ consider measuring cardiac output \nand volume status.\n3 Catheterize for accurate urine output.\nCardiac tamponade Pericardial \ufb02 uid collects \ue003 intrapericardial pressure rises \ue003 \nheart cannot \ufb01 ll \ue003 pumping stops.\nCauses: Trauma, lung/breast cancer, pericarditis, myocardial infarct, bacteria, eg \nTB. Rarely: \ue000urea, radiation, myxoedema, dissecting aorta, SLE. Also coronary artery \ndissection (secondary to PCI) and/or ruptured ventricle.\nSigns: \ue001BP, \ue000JVP, and muffl  ed heart sounds (Beck\u2019s triad); \ue000JVP on inspiration (Kuss-\nmaul\u2019s sign); pulsus paradoxus (pulse fades on inspiration). Echocardiography may \nbe diagnostic. CXR: globular heart; left heart border convex or straight; right cardio-\nphrenic angle <90\u00b0. ECG: electrical alternans (p154).\nManagement: This can be very diffi  cult. Everything is against you: time, physiology, \nand your own con\ufb01 dence, as the patient may be too ill to give a history, and signs \nmay be equivocal\u2014but bitter experience has taught us not to equivocate for long.\n\ue022Request the presence of your senior at the bedside (do not make do with telephone \nadvice). With luck, prompt pericardiocentesis (p773) brings swift relief. While await-\ning this, give O2, monitor ECG, and set up IVI. Take blood for group & save. NB: there \nmay be a role for cardiothoracic surgery (eg CABG, ventricular repair, or pericardial \nwindow) as a de\ufb01 nitive solution to some causes.\n3 Eg Pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO) or lithium dilution cardiac output (LIDCO). Both use injection \n(PICCO = cold water, LIDCO = lithium) to estimate \ufb01 lling pressure, extravascular water (ie pulmonary oedema) \nand cardiac output. The time from injection via a central vein to detection via an arterial line, plus dilution, \ngives estimates of cardiac output and volume status and can guide \ufb02 uid and inotrope therapy.", "text_length": 3234, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 810/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 809, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.583582", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.584434", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
