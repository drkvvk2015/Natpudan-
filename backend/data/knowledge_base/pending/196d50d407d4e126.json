Patients with score >7 or any clinical signs\nof decompensation (variceal bleeding, ascites, ence\nphalopathy) should be considered for liver transplan\ntation. Alternative calculation is a total score of all five\nparameters, grade A=5 6, grade B=7 9, grade\nC=10 15\nMODEL FOR END STAGE LIVER DISEASE (MELD)\nSCORE\noriginally designed to predict survival in\npatients with portal hypertension undergoing elec\ntive TIPS procedure, now used as a tool for organ\nallocation in patients with chronic liver disease. The\nMELD score ranges from 6 to 40, with higher values\nindicating a worse prognosis\n\u0002\nORIGINAL MELD = 9.57 \u0004 loge(Cr in mg/dL) + 3.78\n\u0004 loge(total bilirubin in mg/dL) + 11.2\u0004loge(INR)\n+ 6.43\n\u0002\nUNITED NETWORK OF ORGAN SHARING MELD (UNOS\nMELD) = same formula but fixed lower limit of\n1 for all variables and fixed upper limit of 4 mg/dL\nfor Cr.

The liver is not usually ballotable, but the kidney is\nbecause of its retroperitoneal position\n3. The percussion note is dull over the liver but is\nusually resonant over the kidney\n4. A friction rub may occasionally be heard over the\nliver, but never over the kidney because it is too\nposterior\n5.
