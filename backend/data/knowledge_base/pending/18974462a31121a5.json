May see increased JVP and\nclear lungs clinically. ST elevation in V4R is diagnostic\nand prognostic. Hypotension should be treated with\nfluid bolus to ensure good preload\nPOSTERIOR INFARCTION\nST depression in V1 V2\nin a regular ECG should automatically trigger one to\nrequest for posterior (V7 V9) leads to check for pos\nterior MI. Posterior infarct may be associated with\ninferior infarcts (90%) and lateral infarcts (10%) as\nthe PDA may be supplied by the right or left circum\nflex coronary artery\nPOST MI RISK STRATIFICATION\n\u0002\nEXTENT OF INFARCT/RESIDUAL FUNCTION\nassessment\nis based on clinical factors (\" HR, # BP, Killip class,\ndiabetes, renal failure, \" WBC), ECG, biomarkers\n(CK, troponin), imaging (echocardiogram, MIBI),\nand angiography.

Medical management\n\u0002\nEXTENT OF MYOCARDIUM AT RISK\nassessment is\nbased on exercise stress test, stress echocardio\ngram, stress sestamibi (ischemic tissue), thallium\nscan (viable tissue), PET scan, angiography. Angio\nplasty or CABG should be considered\n\u0002\nRISK OF ARRHYTHMIA\nhigh risk of VF/VT within the\nfirst 48 h, therefore monitor with telemetry. If it\noccurs after 48 h, consider antiarrhythmics and\nearly ICD\nBALLOON PUMP\na long balloon in the descending\naorta that deflates during systole and inflates during\ndiastole to augment coronary perfusion and cardiac\noutput as well as decrease afterload. Indicated if\ncardiogenic shock with hemodynamic instability.\nMay be used in conjunction with inotropes. Contra\nindicated in aortic regurgitation, AAA, aortic dissec\ntion, uncontrolled sepsis bleeding disorder, and\nsevere PVD\nFIBRINOLYTICS USE (TPA, SK, RPA, TNK)\n\u0002\nINDICATIONS\n\u000530 min of chest pain, patient pre\nsents within 12 h (ideal door to needle time\n<30 min), ECG criteria (>1 mm ST \" in \u00052 con\ntiguous leads, or new LBBB with suggestive his\ntory, age <75)\n\u0002\nABSOLUTE\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nany\nintracranial\nhemorrhage, ischemic stroke within 3 months,\ncerebral vascular malformation or brain tumor,\nclosed head or facial trauma within 3 months,\nsuspected aortic dissection, bleeding diathesis, or\nactive bleeding\n\u0002\nRELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS\nsevere hypertension\n(>180/110 mmHg, may be an absolute contraindi\ncation for patients at low risk), ischemic stroke >3\nmonths, other intracranial diseases not already spe\ncified above, dementia, internal bleeding within\n2 4 weeks, active peptic ulcer, major surgery within\n3 weeks, non compressible vascular punctures, cur\nrent warfarin therapy, pregnancy, traumatic CPR\n>10 min, prior exposure to streptokinase or anis\ntreplase (if planning to use these fibrinolytics)\n\u0002\nRISK OF BLEEDING\naverage risk of severe bleed is\n1.8%.
