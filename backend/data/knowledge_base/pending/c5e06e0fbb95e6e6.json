Various subclasses include:\n  \n\u2022 Without impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as \u2018simple\u2019.)\nAwareness is unimpaired, with focal motor, sensory (olfactory, visual, etc.), au-\ntonomic, or psychic symptoms. No post-ictal symptoms.\n  \n\u2022 With impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as \u2018complex\u2019.)Aware-\nness is impaired\u2014either at seizure onset or following a simple partial aura. Most \ncommonly arise from the temporal lobe, in which post-ictal confusion is a fea-\nture.\n  \n\u2022 Evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure: (Previously described as \u2018secondary \ngeneralized\u2019.) In \u2154 of patients with partial seizures, the electrical disturbance, \nwhich start s focally, spreads widely, causing a generalized seizure, which is typi-\ncally convulsive.\nGeneralized seizures Originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging \nbilaterally distributed networks leading to simultaneous onset of widespread \nelectrical discharge with no localizing features referable to a single hemisphere. \nImportant subtypes include:\n  \n\u2022 Absence seizures: Brief (\u226410s) pauses, eg suddenly stops talking in mid-sen-\ntence, then carries on where left off . Presents in childhood.\n  \n\u2022 Tonic\u2013clonic seizures: Loss of consciousness. Limbs stiff en (tonic), then jerk \n(clonic). May have one without the other. Post-ictal confusion and drowsiness.\n  \n\u2022 Myoclonic seizures: Sudden jerk of a limb, face, or trunk. The patient may be \nthrown suddenly to the ground, or have a violently disobedient limb: one patient \ndescribed it as \u2018my \ufb02 ying-saucer epilepsy\u2019, as crockery which happened to be in \nthe hand would take off .\n  \n\u2022 Atonic (akinetic) seizures: Sudden loss of muscle tone causing a fall, no LOC.\n  \n\u2022 Infantile spasms: (OHCS p206) Commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis.\nNB: the classi\ufb01 cation of epileptic syndromes is separate to the classi\ufb01 cation of \nseizures, and is based on seizure type, age of onset, EEG \ufb01 ndings, and other features \nsuch as family history.\nSeizure classi\ufb01 cation\nTemporal lobe \u2022Automatisms\u2014complex motor phenomena with impaired aware-\nness, varying from primitive oral (lip smacking, chewing, swallowing) or manual \nmovements (fumbling, \ufb01 ddling, grabbing) , to complex actions. \u2022Dysphasia. \u2022D\u00e9j\u00e0 \nvu (when everything seems strangely familiar), or jamais vu (everything seems \nstrangely unfamiliar). \u2022Emotional disturbance, eg sudden terror, panic, anger, or \nelation, and derealization (out-of-body experiences).\u2022 Hallucinations of smell, taste, \nor sound. \u2022Delus ional behaviour. \u2022 Bizarre associations\u2014eg \u2018Canned music at Tesco \nalways makes me cry and then pass out\u2019.\nFrontal lobe \u2022Motor features such as posturing or peddling movements of the \nlegs. \u2022Jacksonian march (a spreading focal motor seizure with retained aware-\nness, often starting with the face or a thumb). \u2022Motor arrest. \u2022Subtle behavioural \ndisturbances (often diagnosed as psychogenic). \u2022Dysphasia or speech arrest. \n\u2022Post-ictal Todd\u2019s palsy (p712).\nParietal lobe \u2022Sensory disturbances\u2014tingling, numbness, pain (rare). \u2022Motor \nsymptoms (due to spread to the pre-central gyrus).\nOccipital lobe \u2022Visual phenomena such as spots, lines, \ufb02 ashes.\nLocalizing features of focal seizures", "text_length": 3390, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 499/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 498, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.031336", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.031972", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
