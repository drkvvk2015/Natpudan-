Fluid-\nrestricted patients may require higher concentrations or rates in life-threatening \nhypokalaemia. Faster rates risk cardiac dysrhythmias and asystole, and higher \nconcentrations thrombophlebitis, depending on the size of the vein, so give con-\ncentrated solutions >40mmol/L via a central venous catheter, and use ECG moni-\ntoring for rates >10mmol/h. For symptoms and signs of hyper- and hypokalaemia \nsee p674.\nPotassium in IV \ufb02 uids\nAcute blood loss: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae \nuntil blood is available.\nChildren: Use glucose with sodium chloride for \ufb02 uid maintenance: 100mL/kg for \nthe \ufb01 rst 10kg, 50mL/kg for the next 10kg, and 20mL/kg thereafter\u2014all per 24h.\nElderly: May be more prone to \ufb02 uid overload, so use IV \ufb02 uids with care (smaller \n\ufb02 uid bolus).\nGI losses: (Diarrhoea, vomiting, NG tubes, etc.) Replace lost K\n+ as well as lost \ufb02 uid \nvolume.\nHeart failure: Use IV \ufb02 uids with care to avoid \ufb02 uid overload (p134).\nLiver failure: Patients often have a raised total body sodium, so use salt-poor \nalbumin or blood for resuscitation, and avoid 0.9% saline for maintenance.\nAcute pancreatitis: Aggressive \ufb02 uid resuscitation is required due to large \namounts of sequestered \u2018third-space\u2019 \ufb02 uid (p636).\nPoor urine output: Aim for >1 mL/kg/h; the minimum is >0. 5mL/kg/h. Give a \ufb02 uid\nchallenge, eg 500mL 0.9% saline over 1h (or half this volume in heart failure or the \nelderly), and recheck the urine output. If not catheterized, exclude retention; if \ncatheterized, ensure the catheter is not blocked!\nPost-operative: Check the operation notes for intraoperative losses, and ensure \nyou chart and replace added losses from drains, etc.\nShock: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae. Identify \nthe type of shock (p790).\nTranspiration losses: (Fever, burns.) Beware the large amounts of \ufb02 uid that can \nbe lost unseen through transpiration. Severe burns in particular may require ag-\ngressive \ufb02 uid resuscitation (p846).\nSpecial cases", "text_length": 3251, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 675/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 674, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.328297", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.329072", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
