In orthostatic hypoten\nsion, this response is dampened or lost with\nautonomic failure, leading to hypoperfusion of\nvarious organs ! light headedness, dizziness,\nsyncope, weakness, fatigue, angina, orthostatic\ndyspnea.

Headaches may be\nclassified as new headache, acute thunderclap headache, or chronic headache. Neuroimaging may be done for new\nheadaches at the discretion of physician. All acute thunderclap headaches should be investigated with neuroimaging\nand lumbar puncture. Chronic headaches with high risk features above should be investigated with neuroimaging.\nNo clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2006 296:10\nMigraine Headaches\n313", "text_length": 3267, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 322/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 321, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.689606", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.690501", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
