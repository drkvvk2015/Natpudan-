He had a busy life inventing \nterms such as \u2018neurology\u2019 and \u2018re\ufb02 ex\u2019. Not only has his name been given to his \nfamous circle, but he was the \ufb01 rst to describe myasthenia gravis, whooping \ncough, and the sweet taste of diabetic urine. He was the \ufb01 rst person (few have \nfollowed him) to know the course of the spinal accessory nerve. He is unusual \namong Oxford neurologists in that he developed the practice of giving his lunch \naway to the poor. He also espoused iatrochemistry: a theory of medicine ac-\ncording to which all morbid conditions of the body can be explained by distur-\nbances in the fermentations and eff ervescences of its humours.\nThomas Willis \nAnterior cerebral artery\nInternal\ncarotid artery\nSuperior \ncerebellar\nartery\nPontine\narteries\nVertebral\nartery\nAnterior\nspinal artery\nBasilar\nartery\nOptic chiasm\nAnterior inferior\ncerebellar artery\nPosterior inferior\ncerebellar artery (PICA)\nAnterior communicating artery\nMiddle cerebral artery\nPosterior cerebral artery\nPosterior communicating artery", "text_length": 1585, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 459/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 458, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.960055", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.961634", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
