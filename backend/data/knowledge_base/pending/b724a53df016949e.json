CI: Heart block.\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n115\nCardiovascular medicine\nDigoxin Blocks the Na\n+/K\n+ pump. It is used to slow the pulse in fast AF (p130; aim for \n\ue005100). As it is a weak +ve inotrope, its role in heart failure in sinus rhythm may be \nbest reserved if symptomatic despite optimal ACE-i therapy; 10 here there is little ben-\ne\ufb01 t vis-\u00e0-vis mortality (but admissions for worsening CCF are \ue001 by ~25%).11 Elderly \npeople are at \ue000risk of toxicity: use lower doses. Measure plasma levels >6h post-dose \n(p756). Typical dose: 500mcg stat PO, repeated after 12h, then 125mcg (if elderly) to \n250mcg/d PO OD (62.5mcg/d is almost never enough). IV dose: 0.75\u20131mg in 0.9% NaCl \nover 2h. \ue000Toxicity risk if: \ue001K\n+, \ue001Mg\n2+, or \ue000Ca\n2+. t\u00bd \u2248 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy \nin cardioversion (start at 5J). \ue007If on amiodarone, halve the dose of digoxin. SES: \nAny arrhythmia (supravent ricular tachycardia with AV block is suggestive), nausea, \n\ue001appetite, yellow vision, confusion, gynaecomastia. If toxicity is suspected, do an ECG \n(\ufb01 g 3.19), digoxin levels, and check K\n+, Mg\n2+, and Ca\n2+. If toxicity is con\ufb01 rmed, stop \ndigoxin, correct electrolyte imbalances, treat arrhy thmias, and consider IV DigiFab\u00ae \n(p842). CIS: HCM; WPW syndrome (p133).\nFig 3.19 This ECG shows the classic \u2018reverse \ntick\u2019 of digoxin toxicity: downsloping ST \nwave with rapid upstroke back to isoelec-\ntric line. The bradycardia is also suggestive \nof digoxin toxicity. \nDrugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AVN) include di-\ngoxin, verapamil, and adenosine. Uses include cardioverting AVNRT and diagnos-\ning atrial tachycardias.\nDrugs that slow AVN conduction should be avoided in patients with aberrant \npathways (eg WPW) as blocking the AVN can increase conduction via the alterna-\ntive pathways. AVN blockers are contraindicated in patients with or at risk of VT, eg \nthose with long QT syndrome.\nDrugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node\nSodium channel blockers Class I anti-arrhythmics. Procainamide (1a) and lido-\ncaine (1b) can be used to terminate VT. NB QT interval may be prolonged. Flecainide \n(1c) is useful for AF cardioversion in patients without contraindications, and for ar-\nrhythmia prophylaxis in patients with WPW or troublesome paroxysmal AF. CIS: Heart \nfailure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block.\nAmiodarone A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action \npotential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventric-\nular and ventricular tachycardias, including during cardiac arrest. Broad range of \nside eff ects incl. thyroid disease, liver disease, pulmonary \ufb01 brosis and peripheral \nneuropathy. Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months.\nIvabradine Blocks the pacemaker \u2018funny current\u2019, slowing pulse rate without sig-\nni\ufb01 cantly dropping blood pressure. Used in angina, heart failure, and (off -licence) \nin autonomic tachycardia syndromes. CIS: Acute MI, bradycardia, long QT syndrome, \nshock. Many drug interactions, including with calcium antagonists.\nStatins Statins (eg simvastatin, p690) inhibit the enzyme HMG-COA reductase, which \ncauses de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor ex-\npression by hepatocytes leading to \ue001circulating LDL cholesterol. More eff ective if \ngiven at night, but optimum dose and target plasma cholesterol are unknown. SES: \nMuscle aches, abdominal discomfort, \ue000transaminases (eg ALT), \ue000CK, myositis, rarely \nrhabdo myolysis (more common if used with \ufb01 brates). Statins are generally well tol-\nerated. There are currently ~3 million people taking statins in England, which saves \n~10 000 lives a year.
