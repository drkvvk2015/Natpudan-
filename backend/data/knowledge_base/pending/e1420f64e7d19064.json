The source is often occult.\nRisk factors\n  \n\u2022 Malignancy; myeloproliferative disorder; antiphospholipid syndrome.\n  \n\u2022 Surgery\u2014especially pelvic and lower limb (much lower if prophylaxis used).\n  \n\u2022 Immobility; active in\ufb02 ammation (eg infection, IBD).\n  \n\u2022 Pregnancy; combined OCP; HRT.\n  \n\u2022 Previous thromboembolism and inherited thrombophilia, see p374.\nSigns and symptoms\n  \n\u2022 Acute dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, and syncope.\n  \n\u2022 Hypotension, tachycardia, gallop rhythm, \ue000JVP, loud P2, right ventricular heave, \npleural rub, tachypnoea, cyanosis, AF.\nWith thromboprophylaxis, PE following surgery is far less common, but PE may oc-\ncur after any period of immobility, or with no predisposing factors. Breathlessness \nmay be the only sign. Multiple small emboli may present less dramatically with \npleuritic pain, haemoptysis, and gradually increasing breathlessness. \ue007Look for a \nsource of emboli\u2014especially DVT (is a leg swollen?).\nInvestigations \ue007Risk stratify based upon clinical features (use 2-level Wells\u2019 score \nfor PE\u2014p191). A \u03a9ve D-dimer in a low-probability patient eff ective excludes PE.11\n  \n\u2022 U&E, FBC, baseline clotting.\n  \n\u2022 ECG: commonly normal or sinus tachycardia; right ventricular strain pattern V1\u2013V3 \n(p98), right axis deviation, RBBB, AF, may be deep S waves in I, Q waves in III, in-\nverted T waves in III (\u2018SI QIII TIII\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 CXR: often normal; decreased vascular markings, small pleural eff usion. Wedge-\nshaped area of infarction. Atelectasis.\n  \n\u2022 ABG: hyperventilation + poor gas exchange: \ue001PaO2, \ue001PaCO2, \ue000pH.\n  \n\u2022 Serum D-dimer: low speci\ufb01 city (\ue000 if thrombosis, in\ufb02 ammation, post-op, infection, \nmalignancy) \ue018 check only in patients with low pre-test probability (p191).\n  \n\u2022 CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is sensitive and speci\ufb01 c and is the test of \nchoice for high-risk patients or low-risk patients with a +ve D-dimer. If unavaila-\nble, a ventilation\u2013perfusion (V/Q) scan can aid diagnosis but frequently produces \nequivocal results\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.16 for immediate management.11\n\ue007If good story and signs, make the diagnosis. Start treatment (\ufb01 g 19.16) before \nde\ufb01 nitive investigations: most PE deaths occur within 1h.\n  \n\u2022 Commence LMWH or fondaparinux.\n  \n\u2022 If there is haemodynamic instability, consider thromolysis.\n  \n\u2022 Long-term anticoagulation: either DOAC (p350\u2014switch directly from LMWH) or \nwarfarin (continue LMWH until INR >2).\n  \u2022 Is there an underlying cause, eg thrombophilia (p374), SLE, or polycythaemia? Con-\nsider malignancy (take a careful history and perform a full physical examination; \ncheck CXR, FBC, LFT, Ca\n2+; urinalysis; consider CT abdomen/pelvis and mammogram).\n  \n\u2022 If obvious remedial cause, 3 months of anticoagulation (p351) may be enough; \notherwise, continue for \u22653\u20136 months (long term if recurrent emboli, or \nunderlying malignancy).\nPrevention See p190.", "text_length": 3164, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 826/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 825, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.612464", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.613151", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
