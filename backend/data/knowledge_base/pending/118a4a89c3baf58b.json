The nature of the therapy (pills, rituals, massages) \nmatters less than whether the patient believes the therapy will help.\nExamples of the placebo eff ect in modern medicine include participants in the pla-\ncebo arm of a clinical trial who see dramatic improvements in their refractory illness, \nand patients in severe pain who assume the saline \ufb02 ush prior to their IV morphine \nis opioid and reporting relief of pain before the morphine has been administered. It \nis likely that much of the symptomatic relief experienced from \u2018active\u2019 medicines in \nfact results from a placebo eff ect.\nThe complementary therapy industry has many ingenious ways of utilizing the \nplacebo eff ect. These can give great bene\ufb01 ts to patients, often with minimal risk; but \nthere remains the potential for signi\ufb01 cant harm, both \ufb01 nancially and by dissuading \npatients from seeking necessary medical help.\nWhy evolution has given us bodies with a degree of self-healing ability in response \nto a belief that healing will happen, and not in response to a desire for healing, is \nunclear. Perhaps the belief that a solution is underway \u2018snoozes\u2019 the internal alarm \nsystems that are designed to tell us there is a problem, and so improve the symptoms \nthat result from the body\u2019s perception of harm.\nMany patients who receive therapies are unaware of their intended eff ects, thus \nmissing out on the narrative that may give them an expectation of improvement. Try \nto \ufb01 nd time to discuss with your patients the story of how you hope treatment will \naddress their problems.\nCompliance embodies the imbalance of power between doctor and patient: the \ndoctor knows best and the patient\u2019s only responsibility is to comply with that \nmonopoly of medical knowledge. Devaluing of patients and ethically dubious, the \nterm \u2018compliance\u2019 has been relegated from modern prescribing practice. Con-\ncordance is now king: a prescribing agreement that incorporates the beliefs and \nwishes of the patient.\nOnly 50\u201370% of patients take medicines as prescribed to them. This leads to \nconcern over wasted resources and avoidable illness. Interventions that increase \nconcordance are promoted using the mnemonic: Educating Patients Enhances \nCare Received\n  \n\u2022 Explanation: discuss the bene\ufb01 ts and risks of taking and not-taking medication. \nSome patients will prefer not to be treated and, if the patient has capacity and \nunderstands the risks, such a decision should be respected.\n  \n\u2022 Problems: talk through the patient\u2019s experience of their treatment\u2014have they \nsuff ered side-eff ects which have prompted non-concordance?\n  \n\u2022 Expectations: discuss what they should expect from their treatment. This is im-\nportant especially in the treatment of silent conditions where there is no symp-\ntomatic bene\ufb01 t, eg antihypertensive treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Capability: talk through the medication regimen with them and consider ways \nto reduce its complexity.\n  \n\u2022 Reinforcement: reproduce your discussion in written form for the patient to take \nhome. Check how they are managing their medications when you next see them.\nBut remember that there is little evidence that increasing information improves \nconcordance. And if concordance is increased solely by the \u2018education\u2019 of the pa-\ntient then it starts to look a lot like compliance.11 A truly shared agreement will \nnot always \u2018comply\u2019 or \u2018concord\u2019 with the prescriber. The capacity of the informed \nindividual to consent or not, means that in some cases, concordance looks more \nlike informed divergence.\nCompliance and concordance", "text_length": 3859, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 21/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 20, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.891804", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.893299", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
