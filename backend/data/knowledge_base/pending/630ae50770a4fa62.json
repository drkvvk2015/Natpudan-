Check K\n+ and renal function prior to, and 1\u20132 weeks after, starting treat-\nment or changing dose. Stop if K\n+ >6mmol/L, \ue001eGFR >25%, or \ue001creatinine >30%: ex-\nclude other possible causes and consider a lower dose.\nGlycaemic control: Target HbA1C of ~53mmol/mol (7.0%) unless risk of hypo-\nglycaemia, comorbidity or limited life expectancy.\nLifestyle: Off er advice about exercise, healthy weight, and smoking cessation. Salt \nintake should be reduced to <2g of sodium/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day).\nTreatment of renal complications of CKD\nAnaemia: Check Hb when eGFR <60. Investigate (especially if anaemic with eGFR >30) \nand treat other de\ufb01 ciencies: iron (hypochromic red cells >6%, transferrin saturation \n<20%, ferritin <100), B12, and folate. Do not miss chronic blood loss. Iron therapy may \nneed to be given IV. Consider treatment with an erythropoietic stimulating agent \n(ESA, \u2018Epo\u2019) if Hb <110g/L and likely to bene\ufb01 t in terms of function and quality of \nlife. Pure red cell aplasia is a very rare, severe complication of ESA treatment due to \nanti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60g/L: exclude more common \ncauses of anaemia \ufb01 rst.\nAcidosis: Consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for patients with eGFR <30 and \nlow serum bicarbonate (<20mmol/L). Caution in patients with hypertension and \n\ufb02 uid overload due to sodium component.\nOedema: Restrict \ufb02 uid and sodium intake. High doses of loop diuretics may be need-\ned. Combination of a loop and thiazide diuretic can have a powerful eff ect: distal \ntubule sodium excretion (and its inhibition with a thiazide) is more signi\ufb01 cant when \nalready treated with a loop diuretic (\ufb01 g 7.13). Diuretic treatment should only be given \nwith careful monitoring of \ufb02 uid state and renal function.", "text_length": 3297, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 312/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 311, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.704840", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.705433", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
