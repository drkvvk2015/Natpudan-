Also\nstasis due to # venous tone and flow. Similar risk of\nDVT/PE in each trimester but highest post partum;\n90% of DVT in pregnancies are left sided\nDIAGNOSIS\nif suspect venous thromboembolism,\nconsider initiation of LMWH while waiting for investiga\ntions. For DVT workup, perform compression U/S; if\npelvic vein DVT suspected, consider MRV pelvis (with\nout gadolinium in pregnancy), doppler study, or (post\npartum) CT of pelvic veins. Otherwise, repeat compres\nsion U/S in 5 7 days if still symptomatic. For PE workup,\nrule out other etiologies by performing a CXR. If PE still\nsuspected, consider initial low dose perfusion (Q) scan\nand proceed with CT chest if abnormal. CT chest is\nassociated with lower fetal radiation exposure than V/Q\nscan in T1 2, but higher risk of maternal breast cancer\nRADIATION RISKS\nfetal exposure of <5 cGy [5 rad]\naccumulatively in each pregnancy is acceptable, but\noncologic effects controversial (e.g. childhood leuke\nmia). Consider proximity of fetus to radiations site (i.e.\nradiation from CT chest > V/Q scan in T3)\nFETAL RADIATION EXPOSURE FOR COMMON\nIMAGING MODALITIES\nImaging\nEstimated fetal radiation\nexposure (rad)\nUltrasound\nNone\nCXR\n<0.001\nCT head\n<0.001\nV/Q scan\n0.01 0.02 ventilation (V)\n0.01 0.03 perfusion (Q)\nVENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (CONT\u2019D)\nImaging\nEstimated fetal radiation\nexposure (rad)\nCT chest (PE\nprotocol)\n0.0003 0.002 (T1)\n0.0008 0.0077 (T2)\n0.005 0.013 (T3)\nPulmonary\nangiogram\n<0.05 via brachial route\n0.2 0.3 via femoral route\nCardiac angiogram\n<1\nAXR\n0.2 0.3\nIVP\n0.8 (complete series)\n0.2 (limited series)\nMRI/MRV/MRA\nNone\nRelated Topics\nAsthma (p. 1)\nPulmonary Embolism (p. 8)\nTREATMENTS\nLMWH (monitor anti Xa level). LMWH\nis contraindicated for 12 24 h prior to neuraxial analge\nsia, so switch to unfractionated heparin for \u000324 h prior\nto labor or cesarean delivery. Switch to warfarin post\ndelivery and continue for a minimum of 6 months after\nan acute clot. Rule out thrombophilia. IVC filters may be\nconsidered if prolonged interruption of anticoagulation\nis unsafe. In regard to DVT prophylaxis for future preg\nnancies, give low dose SC LMWH during pregnancy and\n6 weeks post delivery. Warfarin is teratogenic (deformi\nties, fetal hemorrhage).
