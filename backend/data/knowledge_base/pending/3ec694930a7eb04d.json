Of the 4 key components of phar\nmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nexcretion), only the last 3 are meaningfully affected by\nage. Pharmacokinetic changes are related to decreased\nrenal (most important) and hepatic function (phase I\nreactions #, phase II reactions unaffected), decreased\nlean body mass (\" fat), decreased total body water, and\nincreased total body fat\nCOMPLICATIONS\nfalls,\ndelirium,\nincontinence,\nrenal impairment, heart failure, gastrointestinal\nhemorrhage, hypoglycemia, drug drug interactions\nPRESCRIBING PRINCIPLES\ninitiate most medica\ntions at half usual starting dose, increase dose\nslowly. Carry out regular medication reviews and\nstop any unnecessary medications. Avoid medica\ntions with known significant side effects in the\nelderly. Avoid treating adverse drug reactions\nwith further drugs\nUNDER PRESCRIBING IN THE ELDERLY\nREASONS\nFOR\nUNDER PRESCRIBING\nunder\nrecognitionof medication benefit in older patients,\naffordability, and dose availability (i.e. requiring a\ndose of medication that is smaller than supplied by\nthe manufacturer, resulting in more complicated dos\ning strategies such as once every other day dosing)\nOVER PRESCRIBING IN THE ELDERLY\nPOLYPHARMACY AND DRUG INTERACTIONS\n57% of elderly use >5 drugs per week, 19% use\n>10 drugs per week; 1 in 25 are at risk for major\ndrug drug interaction, nearly half involve use of\nanticoagulants or antiplatelet agents\nBEERS\nLIST\nlist\nof\n33\ndrugs\nthat\nshould\nalways be avoided (e.g. meperidine, barbitu\nrates, chlorpropamide), drugs that are rarely\nappropriate (e.g. diazepam, cyclobenzaprine),\nand\ndrugs\nwith\nsome\nindications\nbut\nare\noften misused (e.g. indomethacin, amitriptyline,\noxybutynin)\nSUPPLEMENTS\n49% of elderly use herbal or diet\nary supplements and are at increased risk of herb\ndrug interaction (e.g. ginkgo biloba and warfarin\nresulting in increased bleeding risk)\nAVOID TREATING ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS\nWITH FURTHER DRUGS\nmedications are often\ninappropriately\nprescribed\nto\nsymptomatically\ntreat side effect of another medication.
