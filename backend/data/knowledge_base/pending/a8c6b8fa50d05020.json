It\u2019s com-\nmon in irritable bowel syndrome (p266), but can be caused by tumours.\nRegurgitation\nGastric and oesophageal contents are regurgitated eff ortlessly into the mouth\u2014\nwithout contraction of abdominal muscles and diaphragm (so distinguishing it from \ntrue vomiting). It may be worse on lying \ufb02 at, and can cause cough and nocturnal \nasthma. Regurgitation is rarely preceded by nausea, and when due to gastro-oe-\nsophageal re\ufb02 ux, it is often associated with heartburn. An oesophageal pouch may \ncause regurgitation. Very high GI obstructions (eg gastric volvulus, p611) cause non-\nproductive retching rather than true regurgitation.\nSteatorrhoea\nThese are pale stools that are diffi  cult to \ufb02 ush, and are caused by malabsorption of \nfat in the small intestine and hence greater fat content in the stool.\nCauses: Ileal disease (eg Crohn\u2019s or ileal resection), pancreatic disease, and obstruc-\ntive jaundice (due to \ue001excretion of bile salts from the gallbladder).\nDyspepsia\nDyspepsia and indigestion (p252) are broad terms. Dyspepsia is de\ufb01 ned as one or \nmore of post-prandial fullness, early satiety (unable to \ufb01 nish meal), and/or epigastric \nor retrosternal pain or burning. \u2018Indigestion\u2019 reported by the patient can refer to \ndyspepsia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Try to \ufb01 nd out exactly what your pa-\ntient means and when these symptoms occur in relation to meals, eg the classic \nsymptoms of peptic ulcers occur 2\u20135 hours after a meal and on an empty stomach. \nLook for alarm symptoms (see p248); these have high negative predictive value. \nIf all patients with dyspepsia undergo endoscopy, <33% have clinically signi\ufb01 cant \n\ufb01 ndings.11 Myocardial infaction may present as \u2018indigestion\u2019.\nHalitosis\nHalitosis (fetor oris, oral malodour) results from gingivitis (rarely severe enough to \ncause Vincent\u2019s angina, p712), metabolic activity of bacteria in plaque, or sul\ufb01 de-yield-\ning food putrefaction, eg in gingival pockets and tonsillar crypts. Patients can often be \nanxious and convinced of halitosis when it is not present (and vice versa!).\nContributory factors:\nSmoking, drugs (disul\ufb01 ram; isosorbide), lung disease, hangovers.\n\ue057:\nTry to eliminate anaerobes:\n  \n\u2022 Good dental hygiene, dental \ufb02 oss, tongue scraping.\n  \n\u2022 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate.\nThe very common halitosis arising from the tongue\u2019s dorsum is secondary to over-\npopulated volatile sulfur compound-producing bacteria. Locally retained bacteria \nmetabolize sulfur-containing amino acids to yield volatile (\ue018 smelly) hydrogen sul\ufb01 de \nand methylmercaptane, which perpetuate periodontal disease. At night and be-\ntween meals, conditions are optimal for odour production\u2014so eating regularly may \nhelp. Treat by mechanical cleansing/scraping using tongue brushes or scrapes plus \nmouthwashes. Oral care products containing metal ions, especially Zn, inhibit odour \nformation, it is thought, because of affi  nity of the metal ion to sulfur. It is possible \nto measure the level of volatile sulfur-containing compounds in the air in the mouth \ndirectly by means of a portable sul\ufb01 de monitor.", "text_length": 3266, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 71/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 70, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.985306", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.986466", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
