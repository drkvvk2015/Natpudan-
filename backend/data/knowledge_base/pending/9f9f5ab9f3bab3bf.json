Seen in epilepsy, migraine, and cerebral lesions.1,2Alice Pleasance Liddell, 1865\u20131934\nArnold\u2013Chiari malformation Malformed cerebellar tonsils and medulla herniate \nthrough the foramen magnum. This may cause infantile hydrocephalus with mental \nretardation, optic atrophy, ocular palsies, and spastic paresis of the limbs. Spina bi\ufb01 da, \nsyringomyelia (p516), or focal cerebellar and brainstem signs may occur (p499). There \nmay be bony abnormalities of the base of the skull. Often presents in early adulthood. \nMRI aids diagnosis.  \nJulius Arnold, 1835\u20131915 (German pathologist); Hans Chiari, 1851\u20131916 (Austrian pathologist)\nBaker\u2019s cyst Fluid from a knee eff usion escapes to form a popliteal cyst (often \nswollen and painful) in a sub-gastrocnemius bursa.3 Usually secondary to degen-\neration. \ue059\ue059 : DVT (exclude if calf swelling); sarcoma. Imaging: USS;  MRI. \ue057: None if \nasymptomatic. NSAIDS/ice if painful. Spontaneous resolution may take 10\u201320 months. \nArthroscopy + cystectomy may be needed. \nWilliam M Baker, 1838\u20131896 (British surgeon)\nBazin\u2019s disease (Erythema induratum.) Localized areas of fat necrosis that pro-\nduce painful, \ufb01 rm nodules \u00b1 ulceration and an indur ated rash, characteristically on \nadolescent girls\u2019 calves. It is associated with TB. Nodular vasculitis is a variant unre-\nlated to TB.4  \nPierre-Antoine-Ernest Bazin, 1807\u20131878 (French dermatologist)\nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease A systemic in\ufb02 ammatory disorder of unknown cause, associated \nwith HLA-B5. It is most common along the old Silk Road, from the Mediterranean \nto China. Features: Recurrent oral and genital ulceration, uveitis, skin lesions (eg \nerythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions); arthritis (non-erosive large joint oli-\ngoarthropathy); thrombophlebitis; vasculitis; myo/pericarditis; CNS involvement (py-\nramidal signs); and colitis. Diagnosis: Mainly clinical. Pathergy test: needle prick \nleads to papule formation within 48hrs. \ue057: Colchicine for orogenital ulceration; ster-\noids, azathioprine/cyclophosphamide for systemic disease. In\ufb02 iximab has a role in \nocular disease unresponsive to topical steroids.5  \nHulusi Beh\u00e7et, 1889\u20131948 (Turkish dermatologist)\nBerger\u2019s disease (IgA nephropathy, p311.) Ranges from invisible haematuria to \nrapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Biopsy shows mesangial IgA deposition. Usu-\nally indolent disease, but progression to end-stage renal failure occurs. \ue057: ACE-i/ARB if \n\ue000BP or proteinuria. Immunosuppression considered for progressive disease.6 \n \nJean Berger, 1930\u20132011 (French nephrologist)\nBickerstaff \u2019s brainstem encephalitis Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, are\ufb02 exia, and ex-\ntensor plantars \u00b1 tetra plegia \u00b1 coma, and a reversible brain death picture (but there \nis no structural damage). MRI: hyperintense brainstem signals.

Is the same \ntrue in medicine? At least six others described \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease before Alois Alzheimer \nin 1906, and Tetralogy of Fallot (named after \n\u00c9tienne-Louis Fallot in 1888) was \ufb01 rst de-\nscribed in 1672 by Niels Stenson. Not all medical \neponyms obey Stigler\u2019s law. Forty years after \nit was \ufb01 rst described, the French neurologist \nJean-Marie Charcot (himself associated with at least 15 medical eponyms) attributed the name \n\u2018Parkinson\u2019s Disease\u2019 to the illness outlined in James Parkinson\u2019s 1817 essay \u2018The Shaking Palsy \u2019. \nMonochromatic doctors may try to abolish eponyms by regimenting them to histologically driven \ndisease titles. But classi\ufb01 cations vary as facts emerge, and as a result the renaming of non-eponyms \nbecomes essential. Eponyms, however, carry on forever, because they imply nothing about causes.", "text_length": 4321, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 702/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 701, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.377173", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.377996", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
