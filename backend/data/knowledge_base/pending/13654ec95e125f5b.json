Kipling\u2019s \nwords contain much that might guide the \ndoctor faced with a sudden and unexpected \nemergency. Beyond the oft quoted exhorta-\ntion to \u2018keep your head when all about you \nare losing theirs\u2019, Kipling also endorsed \nan appropriate degree of self-con\ufb01 dence \n(\u2018trust yourself when all men doubt you, But \nmake allowance for their doubting too\u2019), \nencouraged realism (\u2018meet with Triumph \nand Disaster And treat those two impos-\ntors just the same\u2019), and a large measure of \ncourage (\u2018force your heart and nerve and \nsinew To serve your turn long after they are \ngone, And so hold on when there is nothing \nin you Except the Will which says to them: \n\u201cHold on!\u201d \u2019). But what of Dr James? As a \nhouse offi  cer in London, he broke down \nfrom overwork and moved to take up what \nwould become a distinguished practice in \nSouth Africa. A foray into the military ill-\nsuited him and he ended up in jail for leading \na botched raid that was so out-of-character \nthat it seems he allowed himself to become a \nscapegoat for others higher in government. \nHe died in November 1917, outliving Kipling\u2019s \nson John, who was killed in the trenches in \n1915 at the age of 18, and to whom \u2018If \u2019 was \naddressed: \u2018Yours is the Earth and everything \nthat\u2019s in it, And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a \nMan, my son.\u2019\nReproduced under Creative Commons \nAttribution only licence CC BY 4.0 from Wellcome \nLibrary, London.
