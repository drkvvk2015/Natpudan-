Influenza A can be classified into various\nsubtypes based on the combination of two surface\nglycoproteins: neuraminidase (1 of 9 subtypes) and\nhemagglutinin (1 of 16 subtypes), e.g. H1N1, H1N2,\nand H3N2. Influenza A subtypes and influenza B can\nbe further classified into various strains that arise due to\nantigenic drift\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY (CONT\u2019D)\nHOSTS\ninfluenza B and influenza C viruses mainly\naffect humans. In contrast, influenza A can infect both\nhumans and animals, including wild birds, poultry,\npigs, dogs, and horses. Some influenza A strains are\nhighly pathogenic and can cause severe disease in\nspecific hosts, while others are associated with low\npathogenicity. The process whereby at least two dif\nferent viral strains combine to form a new subtype\nwith a mixture of surface antigens of the original\nstrains is termed antigenic shift and is the source of\npandemic influenza virus\nANTIGENIC DRIFT\na gradual change in viral RNA\nsequence that occurs in both influenza A and B. This\nprocess is due to random point mutations in the genes\nencoding neuraminidase or hemagglutinin, creating\nstrains of virus with new surface glycoproteins.\n262\nInfluenza", "text_length": 4278, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 272/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 271, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.620805", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.621484", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
