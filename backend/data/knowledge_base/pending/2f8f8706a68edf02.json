Cachectic? Respiratory dis-\ntress? (if high negative intrathoracic pressures are needed to generate air entry). \nStridor? Respiratory rate, breathing pattern (see BOX \u2018Breathing patterns\u2019). Look for \nchest wall and spine deformities (see p55). Inspect for scars of past surgery, chest \ndrains, or radiotherapy (skin thickening, tattoos for radiotherapy). Chest wall move-\nment: symmetrical? (if not, pathology on restricted side). Paradoxical respiration? \n(abdomen sucked in with inspiration; seen in diaphragmatic paralysis, see p502).\nHands Clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tar stains, \ufb01 ne tremor (\ue020-agonist use), wast-\ning of in trinsic muscles (T1 lesions, eg Pancoast\u2019s tumour, p708). Tender wrists (hy-\npertrophic pulmonary osteo arthropathy\u2014cancer). Aster ixis (CO2 retention). Pulse: \nparadoxical (respiratory distress), bounding (CO2 retention).\nFace Ptosis and constricted pupil (Horner\u2019s syndrome, eg Pancoast\u2019s tumour, p708)? \nBluish tongue and lips (central cyanosis, p34)? Conjunctival pallor (anaemia)?\nNeck Trachea: Central or displaced? (towards collapse or away from large pleural \neff usion/tension pneumothorax; slight deviation to right is normal). Cricosternal dis-\ntance <3cm is hyperexpansion. Tracheal tug: descent of trachea with inspiration (se-\nvere air\ufb02 ow limitation). Lymphadenopathy: TB/Ca? JVP: \ue000 in cor pulmonale.\nPalpation Apex beat: Impalpable? (COPD/pleural eff usion/dextrocardia?) Ex-\npansion: <5cm on deep inspiration is abnormal. Symmetry? Tactile vocal\nfremitus: \ue000 implies consolidation.\nPercussion Dull percussion note: Collapse, consolidation, \ufb01 brosis, pleural thicken-\ning, or pleural eff usion (\u2018stony dull\u2019). Cardiac dullness usually detectable over the left \nside. Liver dullness usually extends up to 5th rib, right mid-clavicular line; below this, \nresonant chest is a sign of lung hyperexpansion (eg asthma, COPD). Hyper-resonant \npercussion note: Pneumothorax or hyperin\ufb02 ation (COPD).\nTable 2.8 Auscultation\nBreath sounds Description\nPathology\nVesicular\nRustling quality\nNormal\nBronchial \nbreathing\nHarsh with gap between inspiration \nand expiration.
