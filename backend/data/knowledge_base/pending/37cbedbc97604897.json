Epi-\ndemiology: Accounts for 90% of renal cancers; mean age 55yrs. \ue032:\ue033\u22482:1. 15% of \nhaemodialysis patients develop RCC. Features: 50% found incidentally. Haematuria, \nloin pain, abdominal mass, anorexia, malaise, weight loss, PUO\u2014often in isolation. \nRarely, invasion of left renal vein compresses left testicular vein causing a varicocele. \nSpread may be direct (renal vein), via lymph, or haemat ogenous (bone, liver, lung). \n25% have metastases at presentation. Tests: BP: \ue000from renin secretion. Blood: FBC \n(polycythaemia from erythropoietin secretion); ESR; U&E, ALP (bony mets?). Urine: \nRBCS; cytology. Imaging: US (p744); CT/MRI; CXR (\u2018cannon ball\u2019 metastases). \ue057: Radical \nnephrectomy (nephron-sparing surgery is as good for T1 tumours + preserves renal \nfunction). Cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation is an option for patients un\ufb01 t or \nunwilling to undergo surgery. RCC is generally radio- & chemoresistant. In those with \nunresectable or metastatic disease, options include: high-dose IL-2 and other T-cell \nactivation therapies; anti-angiogenesis agents (eg pazopanib, sunitinib, axitinib, or \nbevacizumab); mTOR inhibitors, eg temsir olimus. The Mayo prognostic risk score \n(SSIGN) was developed to predict survival and uses information on tumour stage, \nsize, grade, and necrosis. Prognosis: 10yr survival ranges from 96.5% (scores 0\u20131) to \n19.2% (scores \u2265 10).\nTransitional cell carcinoma (TCC) may arise in the bladder (50%), ureter, or renal \npelvis. Epidemiology: Age >40yrs; \ue032:\ue033\u22484:1. Risk factors: p646. Presentation: Pain-\nless haematuria; frequency; urgency; dysuria; urinary tract obstruction. Diagnosis: \nUrine cytology; IVU; cystoscopy + biopsy; CT/MRI. \ue057: See \u2018Bladder tumours\u2019, p646. \nPrognosis: Varies with clinical stage/histological grade: 10\u201380% 5yr survival.\nWilms\u2019 tumour (nephroblastoma) is a childhood tumour of primitive renal tubules \nand mesenchymal cells. Prevalence: 1:100 000\u2014the chief abdominal malignancy in \nchildren. It presents with an abdominal mass and haematuria. \ue057: OHCS p133.\nProstate cancer The commonest male malignancy. Incidence: \ue000with age: 80% \nin men >80yrs (autopsy studies). Associations: +ve family history (x2\u20133 \ue000risk, p521), \n\ue000testost erone. Most are adenocarcinomas arising in peripheral prostate. Spread may \nbe local (seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum) via lymph, or haemat ogenously (sclerotic \nbony lesions). Symptoms: Asymptomatic or nocturia, hesitancy, poor stream, terminal \ndribbling, or obstruction. \ue001Weight \u00b1 bone pain suggests mets. DRE exam of prostate: \nmay show hard, irregular prostate. Diagnosis: \ue000PSA (normal in 30% of small cancers); \ntransrectal US & biopsy; bone scan; CT/MRI. Staging: MRI. Treatment: Disease con\ufb01 ned \nto prostate: options depend on prognosis (see BOX \u2018Prognostic factors\u2019), patient prefer-\nence, and comorbidities. \u2022Radical prostatectomy if <70yrs gives excellent disease-free \nsurvival (laparoscopic surgery is as good). The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy is \nbeing explored. \u2022Radical radiotherapy (\u00b1 neoadjuvant & adjuvant hormonal therapy) is \nan alternative curative option that compares favourably with surgery (no RCTS). It may \nbe delivered as external beam or brachytherapy. \u2022Hormone therapy alone temporar-\nily delays tumour progression but refractory disease eventually develops. Consider \nin elderly, un\ufb01 t patients with high-risk disease. \u2022Active surveillance\u2014particularly if \n>70yrs and low-risk. Metastatic disease: \u2022Hormonal drugs may give bene\ufb01 t for 1\u20132yrs. \nLHRH agonists, eg 12-weekly goserelin (10.8mg SC) \ufb01 rst stimulate, then inhibit pituitary \ngonadotrophin. NB: risks tumour \u2018\ufb02 are\u2019 when \ufb01 rst used\u2014start anti-androgen, eg cypro-\nterone acetate, in susceptible patients. The LHRH antagonist degarelix is also used in \nadvanced disease. Symptomatic \ue057: Analgesia; treat hypercalc aemia; radiotherapy for \nbone mets/spinal cord compression. Prognosis: 10% die in 6 months, 10% live >10yrs. \nScreening: DRE of prostate; transrectal US; PSA (see BOX \u2018Advice to asymptomatic men\u2019).\nPenile cancer Epidemiology: Rare in UK, more common in Far East and Africa, very rare \nin circumcised. Related to chronic irritation, viruses, smegma. Presentation: Chronic \nfungating ulcer, bloody/purulent discharge, 50% spread to lymph at presentation \n\ue057: Radiotherapy & irridium wires if early; amputation & lymph node dissection if late.", "text_length": 4534, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 652/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 651, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.296522", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.297102", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
