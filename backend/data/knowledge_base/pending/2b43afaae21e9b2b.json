Check identity and \nname on unit; tell haematologist; send \nunit + FBC, U&E, clotting, cultures, & urine \n(haemo globinuria) to lab. Keep IV line \nopen with 0.9% saline. Treat DIC (p352).\nAnaphylaxis\nBronchospasm, cyanosis, \ue001BP, soft tissue \nswelling.\nSTOP the transfusion. Maintain airway \nand give oxygen. Contact anaesthetist. \n\ue022See p794.\nBacterial contamination\n\ue000T\u00b0 (rapid onset), \ue001BP, and rigors.\nSTOP the transfusion. Check identity \nagainst name on unit; tell haematologist \nand send unit + FBC, U&E, clotting, cultures \n& urine to lab. Start broad-spectrum \nantibiotics.\nTRALI (See p348) Dyspnoea, cough; CXR \n\u2018white out\u2019.\nSTOP the transfusion. Give 100% O2. \n\ue022Treat as ARDS, p186. Donor should be \nremoved from donor panel.\nNon-haemolytic febrile trans fusion \nreaction\nShivering and fever usually \u00bd\u20131h after \nstarting transfusion.\nSLOW or STOP the transfusion. Give an \nanti pyretic, eg paracetamol 1g. Monitor \nclosely. If recurrent, use WBC \ufb01 lter.\nAllergic reactions\nUrticaria and itch.\nSLOW or STOP the transfusion; chlorphen-\namine 10mg slow IV/IM. Monitor closely.\nFluid overload\nDyspnoea, hypoxia, tachycardia, \ue000JVP and \nbasal crepitations.\nSLOW or STOP the transfusion. Give oxygen \nand a diuretic, eg furosemide 40mg IV \ninitially. Consider CVP line.\nTransfusion reactions\nAdult human beings (with mental \u2018capacity\u2019 see p568) have an absolute right to re-\nfuse any medical treatment, even if to do so seems illogical or could result in their \ndeath. To treat patients despite such a refusal would amount to battery under \ncommon law, or could even amount to a degrading act or torture, against which \nthe European Convention on Human Rights gives absolute, inalienable protection.\nThe biblical verse \u2018no soul of you shall eat blood\u2019 (Leviticus 17:12) is one of sev-\neral that have been interpreted by some religious groups to extend to acceptance \nof blood products in a medical context. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, for example, may \nrefuse potentially vital blood transfusions on such grounds. These views must be \nrespected, but complex issues arise if the patient is a child, or an adult who may \nnot be able to give or withhold consent in an informed way. In an immediately \nlife-threatening situation where further delay may cause harm, treatment such \nas blood products may be given in the child\u2019s best interest, but the team should \nalways involve senior paediatricians and hospital ethicists where practical. If the \nrequirement is less immediate, then the clinicians should seek further legal advice, \nwhich might involve approaching the Courts. \nBlood transfusion and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses", "text_length": 3119, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 357/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 356, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.778726", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.780005", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
