The mosquito acts as the disease vector. Mosquitoes \nare arthropods (see table 9.21). Mosquito-borne diseases can therefore also be de-\nscribed as vector-borne or arthropod-borne disease. When a virus is transmitted by \nan arthropod it is termed an arbovirus (ARthropod-BOrne VIRUS).\n\ue007Malaria See pp416\u20139.\nDengue\nMost important arbovirus in humans. Dengue viruses (Flaviviruses DENV 1\u20134) are \ntransmitted by day-biting Aedes mosquito. 120 countries (\ufb01 g 9.28). Symptoms in 100 \nmillion/yr. UK: ~500 imported cases/yr.\nPresentation: Incubation 3\u201314d. Fever (up to 40\u00b0C), N&V, headache, retro-orbital \npain, myalgia, arthralgia, +ve tourniquet test (in\ufb02 ate BP cuff  to midway between sys-\ntolic and diastolic for 5 min\ue003\u226510 petechiae/inch2). \ue007Warning signs/critical phase \nmay occur 3\u20137d into illness and needs hospital admission: abdominal pain, persistent \nvomiting, \ufb02 uid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, \ue000haematocrit + \ue001plt. \n\ue007Severe disease: shock (includes postural BP drop >20mmHg), respiratory distress, \nsevere bleeding, organ involvement (transaminases >1000, \ue001GCS, other organ failure). \nDiagnosis: PCR for virus/ELISA antigen3 during viraemia (~1st 5d of fever). Serology \n(IgM, IgG) after 5d. Also \ue001plt, \ue001WCC, transaminitis. (\ue031\ue031: Chikungunya, Zika.) Treatment: \nSupportive: prompt but careful \ufb02 uid balance due to potential for plasma leak. IV \ncrystalloid, to maintain eff ective circulation, only in severe disease. 20mL/kg over \n15\u201330min if hypotensive shock. Monitor clinically and via haematocrit. Reduce IV \n\ufb02 uid as soon as stable. Beware: plasma leak maintains haemocrit unless bleeding. \nConsider transfusion if \ue001haematocrit without clinical improvement. Avoid NSAIDs.\nChikungunya\nArbovirus (Alphavirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Widespread: Asia, Africa, \nEurope, and Americas. Name derives from Kimakonde language meaning \u2018to become \ncontorted\u2019 due to arthralgia. Blood-borne and vertical transmission possible, but \nrare. Presentation: Incubation 1\u201312d. Fever. Polyarthralgia: bilateral, symmetrical, \ncan be severe, persistent. Headache, myalgia, N&V, maculopapular rash. Diagnosis:3 \nViral culture/PCR (~1st 8d), serology. Treatment: Supportive. Analgesia.\nYellow fever\nArbovirus (Flavivirus) spread by Aedes mosquitoes in Africa, South America. Pres-\nentation: Incubation ~3\u20136d. Viraemia ~3d with fever, headache, myalgia, anorexia, \nN&V, relative bradycardia (\ue031\ue031: enteric fever p415). ~15% have remission followed \nby severe symptoms ~48h later: epigastric pain, jaundice, AKI, cardiac instability, \nbleeding. Mortality 5%-30%. Diagnosis: Clinical and travel history. Virus/PCR in 1st \n3d.3 Serology: cross reacts with other \ufb02 aviviruses, IgM can persist after vaccination. \nTreatment: Supportive. Live vaccine, eff ective for life (certi\ufb01 cate for 10yr).\nWest Nile and Japanese encephalitis, see Neurological disease pp436\u20137. \nFig 9.28 Countries at risk of dengue (dotted line = 10\u00b0C isotherm).\nReproduced from Johnson et al., Oxford Handbook of Expedition and Wilderness Medicine, 2016, with \npermission from Oxford University Press.\n3 In UK testing done via Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL): www.gov.uk/government/collec-\ntions/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl", "text_length": 3463, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 428/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 427, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.909706", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.910615", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
