When\nrecovery is uncertain, it is better to discuss this with\npatient and family. It is important to understand that\nthe diagnosis of dying can be made, knowing that there\nmay still be a small chance of recovery in some patients\nFEATURES OF DYING PATIENTS\n\u0002\nCANCER\nbed bound, semicomatose, only able to\ntake sips of fluid, unable to take oral drugs\n\u0002\nHEART FAILURE\nprevious admissions with worsen\ning heart failures, no identifiable reversible preci\npitant, medications optimized, deteriorating renal\nfunction, failure to respond within 2 3 days to\nDIAGNOSIS OF DYING (CONT\u2019D)\nappropriate changes in diuretic or vasodilator\ndrugs. The diagnosis of dying is particularly diffi\ncult to make because worsening heart failure may\nbe associated with secondary causes and could\npotentially be reversible once treated\nOVERALL\nno specific criteria for diagnosis of dying,\nbut based on overall clinical impression.

It is\nimportant to minimize use of opioids and to empha\nsize the use of analgesics to maintain function rather\nthan to treat pain\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF PAIN\nSomatic\nVisceral\nNeuropathic\nLocation\nLocalized\nPoorly localized, referred\nRadiation, dermatome\nNature\nAches\nSqueezing, cramping\nShooting, burning\nAnalgesics\nOpioids, NSAIDs\nOpioids\nOpioids, TCAs, antiepileptics, venlafaxine\nPrinciples of Pain Control\n391", "text_length": 4064, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 397/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 396, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.795655", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.796310", "status": "pending"}
