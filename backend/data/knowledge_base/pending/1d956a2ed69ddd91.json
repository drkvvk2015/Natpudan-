Exercise intolerance is the main \nsymptom (from heart comp ression\u2014consider CXR/CT). Indications for surgical \ncorrection (rarely needed): \u22652: a severe, symptomatic deformity; progression \nof deformity; paradoxical respiratory chest wall motion; pectus index >3.25 on \nCT; cardiac or lung compression; restrictive spirometry; cardiac pathology that \nmight be from compression of the heart.\nPsychological eff ects are interesting and not to be dismissed as their eff ects \nmay be greater than any physical eff ects.8 Because these people hate exposing \ntheir chests they may become introverted, and never learn to swim, so don\u2019t let \nthem sink without trace. Be sympathetic, and remember Herr Minty, who inau-\ngurated Graham Greene\u2019s theory of compensation: wherever a defect exists we \nmust look for a compensating perfection to account for how the defect survives. \nIn Minty\u2019s case, although \u2018crooked and yellow and pigeon-chested he had his deep \nrefuge, the in exhaustible ingenuity of his mind.\u2019\nHerr Minty and his pigeon chest", "text_length": 2504, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 67/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 66, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.977176", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.978272", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
