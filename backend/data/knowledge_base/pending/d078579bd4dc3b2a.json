The para protein is recognized as a monoclo-\nnal band (M band) on serum electrophoresis.\n9 There are six major categories:\n1   Multiple myeloma See p368.\n2   Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinaemia This is a lymphoplasmacytoid lympho-\nma producing a monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Hyperviscosity is common (p372), \nwith CNS and ocular symptoms. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are also \nseen. \ue000ESR, with IgM paraprotein on serum electrophoresis. \ue057: None if asympto-\nmatic. Chlorambucil, \ufb02 udarabine, or combination chemotherapy may be used. \nPlasmapheresis\n9 for hyperviscosity (p372).\n3   Primary amyloidosis See following topic.\n4   Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signi\ufb01 cance (MGUS) is common (3% \n>70yrs). There is a paraprotein in the serum but no myeloma, 1\u00b0 amyloid, macro-\nglobulinaemia, or lymphoma, with no bone lesions, no Bence Jones protein, and \na low concentration of paraprotein, with <10% plasma cells in the marrow. Some \ndevelop myeloma or lymphoma. Refer to a haematologist (?for marrow biopsy). \n5   Paraproteinaemia in lymphoma or leukaemia Eg seen in 5% of CLL.\n6   Heavy chain disease Neoplastic cells produce free Ig heavy chains. \ue025 chain dis-\nease is most important, causing malabsorption from in\ufb01 ltration of bowel wall (im-\nmunoproliferative small intestine disease\u2014IPSID). It may progress to lymphoma.\nAmyloidosis\nThis is a group of disorders characterized by extracellular deposits of a protein in \nabnormal \ufb01 brillar form, resistant to degradation. The following are the systemic \nforms of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition is also a feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, and haemodialysis-related amyloidosis.\nAL amyloid (primary amyloidosis) Proliferation of plasma cell clone \ue003 Amyloi-\ndogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins \ue003 Fibrillar light chain protein deposition \ue003 \nOrgan failure \ue003 Death. Associations: myeloma (15%); Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s, lymphoma. \nOrgans involved:\n  \n\u2022 Kidneys: glomerular lesions\u2014proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.\n  \n\u2022 Heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy (looks \u2018sparkling\u2019 on echo), arrhythmias, angina.\n  \n\u2022 Nerves: peripheral and autonomic neuropathy; carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  \n\u2022 Gut: macroglossia (big tongue), \ue001malabsorption/weight, perforation, haemor-\nrhage, obstruction, and hepatomegaly.\n  \n\u2022 Vascular: purpura, especially periorbital\u2014a characteristic feature (\ufb01 g 8.74).\n\ue057: optimize nutrition; PO melphalan + prednisolone extends survival. High-dose IV \nmelphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation may be better.\nAA amyloid (secondary amyloidosis) Here amyloid is derived from serum amyloid \nA, an acute phase protein, re\ufb02 ecting chronic in\ufb02 ammation in rheumatoid arthritis, \nUC/Crohn\u2019s, familial Mediterranean fever, and chronic infections\u2014TB, bronchiectasis, \nosteomyelitis. It aff ects kidneys, liver, and spleen (\ufb01 g 8.75), and may present with \nproteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatosplenomegaly. Macroglossia is not seen; \ncardiac involvement is rare (ventricular hypertrophy and murmurs).\n \ue057: manage the \nunderlying condition optimally.\nFamilial amyloidosis (Autosomal dominant, eg from mutations in transthyretin, \na transport protein produced by the liver.) Usually causes a sensory or autonomic \nneuropathy \u00b1 renal or cardiac involvement. Liver transplant can cure.\nDiagnosis: Made with biopsy of aff ected tissue, and positive Congo Red staining \nwith apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The rectum or \nsubcutaneous fat are relatively non-invasive sites for biopsy and are +ve in 80%.\nPrognosis: Median survival is 1\u20132 years. Patients with myeloma and amyloidosis \nhave a shorter survival than those with myeloma alone. \n9 Electrophoresis and plasmapheresis look as though they should share endings, but they do not: Greek \nphoros = bearing (esis = process), but aphairesis is Greek for removal.", "text_length": 4041, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 378/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 377, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.818769", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.820088", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
