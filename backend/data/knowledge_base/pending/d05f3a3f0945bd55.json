Pro-\nceed to test with cotton wool in all dermatomes \n(see p454), comparing left and right.\n  \n\u2022 Pin prick: Repeat as above using a neurological pin, \nasking patient to tell you if it feels sharp or dull.\n  \n\u2022 Temperature: Repeat as above, alternating hot and \ncold probes. Can the patient tell hot from cold?\n  \n\u2022 Vibration: Using a 128Hz tuning fork (128 vibrate!) \ncon\ufb01 rm with patient that they \u2018can feel a buzzing\u2019 \nwhen you place the tuning fork on their sternum. \nProceed to test at the most distal bony promi-\nnence and move proximally by placing the buzzing \nfork on the bony prominence, then stopping it with \nyour \ufb01 ngers. Ask the patient to tell you when the \nbuzzing stops.\n  \n\u2022 Proprioception: With the patient\u2019s eyes closed \ngrasp distal phalanx of the index \ufb01 nger at the \nsides, not on top. Stabilize the rest of the \ufb01 nger. \nFlex and extend the joint, stopping at intervals to \nask whether the \ufb01 nger tip is up or down.\n5 Coordination\nHolding your \ufb01 nger in front of the patient \ninstruct \u2018touch my \ufb01 nger then your nose\u2026as \nfast as you can\u2019. Look for intention tremor, and \n\u2018past pointing\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 Test for dysdiadokokinesis: ask patient to \nrepeatedly pronate and supinate forearm, \ntapping hands each time. Test both limbs. \nYou may have to demonstrate. Failure to \nperform rapidly alternating movements is \ndysdiadokokinesis.\n  \n\u2022 Test for pronator drift: with patient\u2019s eyes \nclosed and arms outstretched, tap down on \ntheir up-facing palms and look for a failure to \nmaintain supination.\n4 Re\ufb02 exes\nFor each re\ufb02 ex, test right, then left and com-\npare. If absent, attempt to elicit with \u2018rein-\nforcement\u2019 by asking patient to clench their \nteeth on a count of three, at which time you \nstrike (Jendrassik manoeuvre).
