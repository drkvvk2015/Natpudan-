Headache worse on waking, lying down, bending forward, or \nwith coughing (p456); vomiting; papilloedema (only in 50% of tumours); \ue001GCS.\n  \n\u2022 Seizures: Seen in \u226450%. Exclude SOL in all adult-onset seizures, especially if focal, or \nwith a localizing aura or post-ictal weakness (Todd\u2019s palsy, p712).\n  \n\u2022 Evolving focal neurology: See BOX for localizing signs. \ue000ICP causes false localizing \nsigns: VIth nerve palsy is commonest (p70) due to its long intracranial course.\n  \n\u2022 Subtle personality change: Irritability, lack of application to tasks, lack of initia-\ntive, socially inappropriate behaviour.\nCauses Tumour (primary or metastatic, later in topic), aneurysm, abscess (25% \nmultiple); chronic subdural haematoma, granuloma (p197, eg tuberculoma), cyst (eg \ncysticercosis). Tumours: 30% are metastatic (eg breast, lung, melanoma). Prima-\nries: astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, oligo dendro glioma, ependymoma. Also \nmeningioma, primary CNS lymphoma (eg as non-infectious manifestation of HIV), and \ncerebellar haemangio blastoma.\nDiff erentials Stroke, head injury, venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis, MS, encephali-\ntis, post-ictal, metabolic, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.\nTests CT \u00b1 MRI (good for posterior fossa masses). Consider biopsy. Avoid LP before \nimaging (risks coning, ie cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum).\nTumour management Benign: Remove if possible but some may be inaccessi-\nble. Malignant: Excision of gliomas is hard as resection margins are rarely clear, \nbut surgery does give a tissue diagnosis, it debulks pre-radiotherapy, and makes a \ncavity for inserting carmustine wafers (delivers local chemotherapy). If a tumour \nis inaccessible but causing hydrocephalus, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt can help. \nChemo-radiotherapy is used post-op for gliomas or metastases, and as sole therapy \nif surgery is impossible. Oligodendroglioma with 1p/19q deletions is especially sensi-\ntive. In glioblastoma, temozolomide (alkylating agent) \ue000survival. Seizure prophylaxis \n(eg pheny toin) is important, but often fails. Treat headache (eg codeine 60mg/4h PO). \nCerebral oedema: Dexamethasone 4mg/8h PO; mannitol if \ue000ICP acutely (p831). Plan \nmeticulous palliative treatment (p534).\nPrognosis Poor but improving (<50% survival at 5yrs) for CNS primaries; 40% 20yr \nsurvival for cerebellar haemangio blastoma; benign tumours are curable by excision.\nThird-ventricle colloid cysts These congenital cysts declare themselves in adult \nlife with amnesia, headache (often positional), obtundation (blunted consciousness), \nincontinence, dim vision, bilateral paraesthesiae, weak legs, and drop attacks. \n\ue057: Excision or ventriculo-peritoneal shunting.\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension \nThink of this in those presenting as if with a mass (headache, \ue000ICP, and papilloede-\nma)\u2014when none is found. Most commonly seen in obese females in 3rd decade, who \npresent with narrowed visual \ufb01 elds, blurred vision \u00b1 diplopia, VIth nerve palsy, and \nan enlarged blind spot, if papilloedema is present (it usually is). Consciousness and \ncognition are preserved.\nAssociations Endocrine abnormalities (Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypoparathyroidism, \n\ue000\ue001TSH), SLE, CKD, IDA, PRV, drugs (tetracycline, steroids, nitrofurantoin, and oral con-\ntraceptives).\nManagement Weight loss, acetazolamide or topiramate, loop diuretics, and predni-\nsolone (start at ~40mg/24h PO; more SE than diuretics). Consider optic nerve sheath \nfenestration or lumbar\u2013peritoneal shunt if drugs fail and visual loss worsens. \nPrognosis Often self-limiting.
