However, in\npatients without diabetes who are presenting with\nhypoglycemia, it is important to rule out alcoholism,\nsevere sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and panhypopi\ntuitarism. Insulinoma is rare and should be a diagno\nsis of exclusion. Always consider surreptitious use if\nno obvious cause found, especially if there is possibi\nlity of access to diabetic drugs\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nSYMPTOMS\nsweating, palpitations, tachycardia,\ndizziness, blurred vision, mental deficits, altered\nlevel of consciousness\nCLINICAL FEATURES (CONT\u2019D)\nWHIPPLE\u2019S TRIAD\nhypoglycemia, symptoms of\nhypoglycemia, reversal of symptoms with glucose\nINVESTIGATIONS\nBASIC\n\u0002\nLABS\nWhenever the glucose is found to be low,\nserum glucose, insulin, C peptide, and proinsulin\nshould be sent along with a spot urine for sulfo\nnylurea screen.
