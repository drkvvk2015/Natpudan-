The echo is \nnot detected, and so the vessel lumen appears black (\ufb02 ow void).\nRather than radiodensity or attenuation, the correct descriptive terminology for the \ngreyscale seen in MRI is signal intensity: high signal appears white and low signal black \n(see  table 16.4). Weighting is a quality of MRI that is dependent on the time between \nthe RF pulses (repetition time, TR) and the time between an RF pulse and the echo (echo \ntime, TE). MR images are most commonly T1-weighted (good for visualizing anatomy) \nor T2-weighted (good for visualizing disease) but can also be a mixture of both, called \nproton density (PD) weighting. FLAIR sequences produce heavily T2-weighted images. \nA good way to determine the weighting of an MR image is to look for water\u2014eg in the \naqueous humour of the eye, CSF, or synovial \ufb02 uid (see table 16.4; \ufb01 g 16.17).\nTable 16.4 MRI sequence characteristics\nT1-weighted\nT2-weighted\nTR\nTE\nShort (<1000ms)\nShort (<30ms)\nLong (>2000ms)\nLong (>80ms)\nLow \nsignal\nWater\nFlowing Hb\nFresh Hb\nHaemosiderin\nBone\nFlowing Hb\nDeoxyHb\nHaemosiderin\nMelanin\nHigh \nsignal\nBone marrow\nFat\nCholesterol\nGadolinium (p762)\nMetHb\nWater\nCholesterol\nFresh Hb\nMetHb\nAdvantages MRI\u2019s great bonus is that it \ndoes not involve ionizing radiation. It has \nno known long-term adverse eff ects. It is \nexcellent for imaging soft tissues (water- and hence proton-dense) and is preferred \nover CT for musculoskeletal disorders and for many intracranial, head, and neck pa-\nthologies (\ufb01 gs 16.18\u201316.20). Multiplanar acquisition of images can provide multiple \nviews and 3D reconstruction from one scan. MR angiography is also excellent for \nreconstructing vascular anatomy. This avoids the need for invasive angiography with \nfemoral puncture or CT contrast in patients with renal impairment.\nDisadvantages Long acquisition times. Poor imaging of lung parenchyma. Claustro-\nphobic. Incompatible with some metal implants. High cost and specialized interpre-\ntation (=limited availability).\nContraindications Absolute: \u2022Pacemakers; other implanted electrical devices. \n\u2022Metallic foreign bodies, eg intra-ocular (consider orbital X-ray to exclude), shrapnel. \n\u2022Non-compatible surgical clips/coils/heart valves. Relative: \u2022If unable to complete \nthe pre-scan questionnaire. \u2022Cochlear implants. NB: orthopaedic prostheses and ex-\ntracranial metallic clips are generally safe. \ue007If uncertain, ask a radiologist. Contrast: \n\u2022Renal impairment (gadolinium can cause systemic \ufb01 brosis). \u2022Allergy. \u2022Pregnancy.\nFig 16.17 T1-weighted MRI of the hips.
