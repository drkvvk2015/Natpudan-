Rehabilitation must be started early post-stroke in order \nto maximize improvement and prevent complications related to immobility such as \npressure sores, aspiration pneumonia, constipation, and contractures. Ongoing input \nafter discharge consolidates inpatient gains and helps align the individual with their \nprevious capability. It also helps with depression\u2014both in the patient and their carer. \n\ue007Setting achievable goals and acknowledging the patient\u2019s own agenda is key.\nImperatives for re-enablement\n  \u2022 Watch the patient swallow a small volume of water; if signs of aspiration (a cough \nor voice change) make nil by mouth until formal assessment by a speech therapist. \nUse IV \ufb02 uids, then semi-solids (eg jelly; avoid soups and crumbly food). Avoid early \nNG tube feeds; these may be needed to safeguard nutrition in those with swallowing \nproblems that persist beyond the \ufb01 rst 2\u20133d. If swallowing fails to recover, consider \nbene\ufb01 ts of enteral feeding tube placement (p759). Speech therapists skilled in assess-\ning swallowing diffi  culties are invaluable here.\n  \n\u2022 Avoid further injury: minimize falls risk and take care when lifting the patient not \nto damage their shoulders.\n  \n\u2022 Ensure good bladder and bowel care through frequent toileting. Avoid early cath-\neterization which may prevent return to continence.\n  \n\u2022 Position to minimize spasticity (occurs in ~40%). Get prompt physiotherapy. Splints \nand botulinum toxin injections are helpful for focal spasticity.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor progress: eg measure time taken to sit up and transfer to chair.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor mood: in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability (sobbing unprovoked \nby sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system), tricyclics or \n\ufb02 uoxetine may help.\n  \n\u2022 Engage the patient in their own recovery by making physiotherapy fun. Swimming \n(a hemiplegic arm may be supported on a special \ufb02 oat), music, and video games are \nall enjoyable and \ue000 recovery through promoting cerebral reorganization. Constraint \nof the good arm may be helpful.\n\ue007Involve the carer/spouse with all aspects of care-giving. Good rehab saves lives.\nTests Asking to point to a named part of the body tests perceptual function. Copy-\ning matchstick patterns tests spatial ability. Dressing or copying a clock face tests \nfor apraxia (p86). Picking out and naming easy objects from a pile tests for agnosia \n(acuity OK, but cannot mime use; guesses are way-out, semantically, and phonetically). \nScreen for depression (low mood; inability to feel pleasure or to concentrate).\nEnd-of-life decisions \ue007See p13.", "text_length": 2804, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 482/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 481, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.998913", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.999651", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
