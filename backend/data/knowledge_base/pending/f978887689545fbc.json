Character (eg barking/hollow/dry)? Nocturnal (\u2248asthma, \nask about other atopic symptoms, ie eczema, hay fever)? Exacerbat-\ning factors? Sputum (colour? How much?). Any blood/haemoptysis?\nHaemoptysis\n(see table 2.6 and \nBOX \u2018Haemop-\ntysis\u2019)\nAlways think about TB (recent foreign travel?) and mal ignancy \n(weight loss?). Mixed with sputum? (Blood not mixed with sputum \nsuggests pulmonary embolism, trauma, or bleeding into a lung cav-\nity. ) Melaena? (Occurs if enough coughed-up blood is swallowed.)\nDyspnoea\n(see table 2.7 and \nBOX \u2018Dyspnoea\u2019 \nand p782)\nDuration? Steps climbed/distance walked before onset? NYHA clas-\nsi\ufb01 cation (p135)? Diurnal variation (\u2248asthma)?\nAsk speci\ufb01 cally about circumstances in which dyspnoea occurs (eg \noccupational allergen exposure).\nHoarseness\n(OHCS p568)\nEg due to laryngitis, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, Singer\u2019s \nnodules, or laryngeal tumour.\nWheeze (p52)\nFever/night \nsweats (p29)\nChest pain\n(p94 & p784)\nSOCRATES (see p36), usually \u2018pleuritic\u2019 if respiratory (ie worse on \ninspiration?).\nStridor (see BOX \n\u2018Stridor\u2019)\nHistory Ask about current symptoms (table 2.5) and past history: pneumonia/bron-\nchitis; TB; atopy\n3 (asthma/eczema/hay fever); previous CXR abnormalities; lung surgery; \nmyopathy; neurological disorders. Connective tissue disorders, eg rheumatoid, SLE.\nDrug history Respiratory drugs (eg steroids, bronchodilators)? Any other drugs, esp -\necially with respiratory SE (eg ACE inhibitors, cytotoxics, \ue020-blockers, amiodarone)?\nFamily history Atopy?\n3 Emphysema? TB?\nSocial history Quantify smoking in \u2018pack-years\u2019 (20 cigarettes/day for 1 year = 1 \npack-year). Occupational exposure (farming, mining, asbestos) has possible compen-\nsatory implications. Pets at home (eg birds)? Recent travel/TB contacts?\nInspiratory sound due to partial obstruction of upper airways. Obstruction may \nbe due to something within the lumen (eg foreign body, tumour, bilateral vocal \ncord palsy), within the wall (eg oedema from anaphylaxis, laryngospasm, tumour, \ncroup, acute epiglottitis, amyloidosis), or extrinsic (eg goitre, oesophagus, lymph-\nadenopathy, post-op stridor, after neck surgery). It\u2019s an emerg ency (\ue022p772) if gas \nexchange is compromised. NB: wheeze is an expiratory sound.\nCharacteristic coughs\nCoughing is relatively non-speci\ufb01 c, resulting from irritation anywhere from the \npharynx to the lungs. The character of a cough may, however, give clues as to the \nunderlying cause:\n  \n\u2022 Loud, brassy coughing suggests pressure on the trachea, eg by a tumour.\n  \n\u2022 Hollow, \u2018bovine\u2019 coughing is associated with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.\n  \n\u2022 Barking coughs occur in croup.\n  \n\u2022 Chronic cough Think of pertussis, TB, foreign body, asthma (eg nocturnal).\n  \n\u2022 Dry, chronic coughing may occur following acid irritation of the lungs in oe-\nsophageal re\ufb02 ux, and as a side-eff ect of ACE inhibitors.\n\ue007Do not ignore a change in character of a chronic cough; it may signify a new \nproblem, eg infection, malignancy.\nStridor\n3 Atopy implies predisposition to, or concurrence of, asthma, hay fever and eczema with production of \nspeci\ufb01 c IgE on exposure to common allergens (eg house dust mite, grass, cats).", "text_length": 3432, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 60/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 59, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.963059", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.964358", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
