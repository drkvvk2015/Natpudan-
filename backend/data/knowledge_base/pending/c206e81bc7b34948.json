If prolonged NPO, use IV b\nblocker if hypertension and hydralazine/nitrate\nif HF). Diuretics (continue up to day before\nsurgery but stop day of surgery. If prolonged\nNPO, use IV form on PRN basis). ASA (vascular\nprotective effect thus should not stop unless\nhigh risk of bleed, e.g. CNS surgery. If so, hold\n7 10 days before surgery and restart 6 h\npostop). Dipyridamole (similar to ASA in\nterms of indications for stopping. If stop, hold\n2 days before surgery)\n\u0003\nCARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS\nclopidogrel and ticlo\npidine (dependent on indication: often standard\nto hold 7 10 days before surgery. If used following\nangioplasty, continue for at least 6 weeks before\nstopping. Continue combination clopidogrel+ASA\nfor at least 1 month for bare metal stents and 12\nmonths for drug eluting stents. Premature discon\ntinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy increases risk\nof perioperative cardiac death 5 10\u0002, incidence\n30%. Combination clopidogrel+ASA increases\nabsolute risk of major perioperative bleeding by\n0.4 1% compared to ASA alone. Generally, most\nsurgeries can be performed without discontinuing\nantiplatelet therapy for recent coronary stenting,\nexcept neurosurgery or posterior chamber eye\nsurgery). NSAIDs (some vascular protective effect\nbut also potential renal failure. Hold 3 days before\nsurgery, substitute with acetaminophen desired).\nStatins (continue up to and including day of sur\ngery). Fibrates/niacin/cholestyramine (continue\nup to day before surgery but stop day of surgery)\n\u0003\nANTICOAGULATION\nelective surgery should be\ndelayed till at least 1 month after treatment of\nvenous or arterial thromboembolism. If low\nperioperative bleeding risk, maintain INR <2\nwith warfarin. If high perioperative bleeding\nrisk, keep INR <1.5 by stopping warfarin 4 7\ndays preoperatively. If high risk of thrombosis\n(<1 month of any thrombosis, some valvular\nheart diseases, mechanical valves), start patient\non IV heparin until 4 h preop and then restart\nwithin 24 h postop (once hemostasis achieved).\nStart warfarin postoperatively when there is no\ncontraindication to anticoagulation (as early as\nday of operation, depending on surgery type),\nand stop IV heparin when INR >2\n\u0003\nSTEROIDS\npatients taking prednisone >20 mg/\nday for >3 weeks or with Cushingoid features\nshould be assumed to have HPA axis suppression.\nFor minor stress (local anaesthetic), no stress dose\nsteroids needed. For moderate stress (orthopedic,\nperivascular),\nconsider\n2\u0002\nphysiologic\nMANAGEMENT OF PERIOPERATIVE PATIENTS (CONT\u2019D)\nreplacement (hydrocortisone 50 mg IV on call to\nOR, then 25 mg q8h \u000224 hours, then normal\ndose). For major stress (intra abdominal, car\ndiac), consider high dose steroid (hydrocorti\nsone 100 mg IV on call to OR, then 50 mg q8h\n\u000224 h, then 25 mg q8h \u000224 h, then resume\nmaintenance)\n\u0003\nDIABETIC AGENTS\nkey principle is to avoid hypo\nglycemia and hyperglycemia. Oral hypoglyce\nmics (continue up to day before surgery and\ndiscontinue AM dose on day of surgery. If pro\nlonged NPO or hyperglycemia, substitute with\ninsulin sliding scale). Insulin (decrease nighttime\ninsulin dose by half the night prior to surgery and\nomit morning insulin the day of surgery. For short\nprocedures, may give 1/3 to 1/2 long or inter\nmediate acting insulin dose. For complicated pro\ncedures, type 1 diabetics, or volatile sugar levels\nin type 2 diabetics, consider insulin drip)\n\u0003\nTHYROID\nAGENTS\nthyroxine (T4) should be\ngiven IV or IM (80% of PO dose) if oral intake\ncannot be resumed in 5 7 days. Otherwise, can\nmiss a few days without effect\n\u0003\nNEUROLOGIC AGENTS\nantiepileptics (continue\nup to and including day of surgery.
