Physician owes patient duty of care\n2. Physician breaches standard of care\n3. Breach causes harm to patient\n4. Physician\u2019s mistake is responsible for patient\u2019s loss\n(causation)\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nEXAMPLE\nHIV disclosure to spouse\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER\nautonomy, need trust for\ntherapeutic relationship\nAPPROACH\nbreaching confidentiality is based on a\nbalance of beneficence, non maleficence, and auton\nomy. Legally can breach confidentiality if required by\ncourt/law, patient consent obtained, or if public inter\nest at stake (e.g. HIV, child abuse, and people who are\nunfit to drive)\nFUTILITY\nEXAMPLE\nCPR in patient with advanced cancer\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER\nlimits of patient auton\nomy and considerations of justice and resource\nallocation\nAPPROACH\ncommunication (understand patient\u2019s\nrationale), negotiation, mediation (bioethicist), and\narbitration. No legal obligation to provide treatment\noutside of standard of care\nMAY REFUSE PROVIDING TREATMENT\nif harm to\nself/others, futility, or excessive cost to society\nEUTHANASIA\nEXAMPLE\nALS patient asks for active euthanasia\nTYPES\nactive euthanasia is direct involvement of\nkilling a patient (e.g. injection of KCl), while passive\neuthanasia is providing the means for the patient to\nkill himself (e.g. preparing KCl)\nARGUMENTS FOR\nautonomy, the relief of suffer\ning, and discrimination against physically disabled\npersons who cannot commit suicide\nARGUMENTS AGAINST\nrespect for human life,\nprotection of vulnerable persons, and fear of abuse\nLEGALLY\nwithdrawal of care and palliative seda\ntion (for the purpose of maximizing comfort) are\nacceptable,\nbut\npassive/active\neuthanasia\nnot\nallowed based on intention and causation\nRESOURCE ALLOCATION\nEXAMPLE\nselection of organ transplant recipients\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER\njustice\n1. No one disputes that resources are scarce and\nrationing decisions are required\n2. It is unfair to ration based on implicit criteria that\nmay vary from physician to physician\n3. Rationing criteria must be explicit, evenly applied,\npublicly known, and open to review\n4. It is unfair to begin rationing by denying resources\nto the most vulnerable patients\n5. An alternative to rationing is to augment the\navailability of the scarce resource\nLEVELS\nmacro (provincial/national), meso (hospi\ntal), micro (individual patient)\nRATIONING\ndiscrimination on the basis of age,\ngender, or religion is legally and morally not feasible.\nAllocation based on greater benefit and/or more\nurgent need is acceptable. Financial considerations\nshould be taken into account, but do not justify\nomission of appropriate care\nRESEARCH ETHICS\nEXAMPLE\nplacebo control\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER\nbeneficence, non male\nficence, autonomy, and justice.
