Expected changes and guidance on when to inves-\ntigate for possible underlying pathology is given in table 1.3.\nTable 1.3 Physiology and pathology in pregnancy\nSystem\nNormal pregnancy\nConsider pathology\nCardiovascular\n\ue001BP before 20 weeks\u2019 gestation \nDiastolic BP >80mmHg in 1st \ntrimester\n\ue000 Heart rate\nSustained tachycardia >100/min\nRespiratory\nCompensated respiratory \nalkalosis\nSerum bicarbonate <18mmol/L\nNo change in PEFR\nDecrease in PEFR\n\ue000Respiratory rate by 10%\nRespiratory rate >20/min\nRenal\n\ue000GFR and creatinine clearance\nCreatinine >85\u03bcmol/L (eGFR not valid \nin pregnancy)\n\ue000Protein excretion\nProtein:creatinine ratio >30mg/mmol\nEndocrine\nAltered glucose handling \nFasting glucose >5.0mmol/L\nHaematology\nHaemodilution\nHb <10.5g/dL, platelets <100x10\n9/L\nRadiology\nIf the uterus is positioned outside the imaging \ufb01 eld of view, the radiation dose to the \nconceptus is minimal. Exposure from the following investigations is well below the \nthreshold of risk to the fetus:\n  \n\u2022 Plain radiograph: chest, extremities, spine.\n  \n\u2022 CT: head, chest (but consider radiation to maternal breast in pregnancy/lactation).\nUltrasound and MRI are preferentially used when imaging the abdomen.\n\ue007Reassure your pregnant patient that a chest x-ray is safe. It is the equivalent of 3 \ndays of background radiation. Do not presume it is not required\u2014how else will you \npick up the widened mediastinum as a cause for her chest pain?\nDrugs\nFor drugs prescribed in pregnancy, bene\ufb01 t must be balanced against risk (table 1.4). \nFor information on drugs in lactation see: https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm.\nTable 1.4 Drugs in pregnancy\nConsidered safe\nContraindicated\nPenicillins\nTetracycline/doxycycline\nMacrolides\nCipro\ufb02 oxacin\nLow-molecular-weight heparin\nTrimethoprim (1st trimester)\nAspirin\nNSAIDS (3rd trimester)\nLabetalol\nACE-i\nNifedipine\nARA\nAdenosine\nMycophenolate\nPrednisolone\nWarfarin\nTreatment for asthma: salbutamol, ipratropium, \naminophylline, leukotriene antagonists\nLive vaccines (MMR, BCG, Varicella)\nSepsis\n\ue022Do not underestimate sepsis in pregnancy.
