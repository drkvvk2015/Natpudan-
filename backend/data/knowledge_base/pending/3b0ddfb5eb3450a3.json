Cause Unknown environmental triggers (?pollutants, xenobiotics, \nnon-pathogenic bacteria) + genetic predisposition (eg IL12A locus) leading to loss of \nimmune tolerance to self-mitochondrial proteins. Antimitochondrial antibodies \n(AMA) are the hallmark of PBC. Prevalence \ue0054/100 000. \ue033:\ue032 \u2248 9:1. Risk \ue000 if +ve fam-\nily history (seen in 1\u20136%); many UTIS; smoking; past pregnancy; other auto immune \ndiseases; \ue000 use of nail polish/hair dye. Typical age at presentation ~50yrs.\nThe patient Often asymptomatic and diagnosed after incidental \ufb01 nding \ue000ALP. Leth-\nargy, sleepiness, and pruritus may precede jaundice by years. Signs: Jaundice; skin \npigmentation; xanthelasma (p691); xanth omata; hepatosplenomegaly. Complica-\ntions: Those of cirrhosis (p276); osteoporosis is common. Malabsorption of fat-soluble \nvitamins (A, D, E, K) due to cholestasis and \ue001bilirubin in the gut lumen results in osteo-\nmalacia and coag ulopathy; HCC (p286).\nTests Blood: \ue000ALP, \ue000\ue034GT, and mildly \ue000AST & ALT; late disease: \ue000bilirubin, \ue001albumin, \n\ue000prothrombin time. 98% are AMA M2 subtype +ve, eg in a titre of 1:40 (see earlier in \ntopic). Other autoantibodies (p553) may occur in low titres. Immunoglobulins are \ue000 \n(esp. IgM). TSH & cholesterol \ue000 or \ue009. Ultrasound: Excludes extrahepatic cholestasis. \nBiopsy: Not usually needed (unless drug-induced cholestasis or hepatic sarcoidosis \nneed excluding); look for granulomas around bile ducts \u00b1 cirrhosis.\n31\nTreatment Symptomatic: Pruritus: try colestyramine 4\u20138g/24h PO; naltrexone and \nrifampicin may also help. Diarrhoea: codeine phosphate, eg 30mg/8h PO. Osteoporo-\nsis prevention: p682. Speci\ufb01 c: Fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis: vitamin A, D, and K. \nConsider high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)\u03a9it may improve survival and delay \ntransplantation. SE: \ue000weight. Monitoring: Regular LFT; ultrasound \u00b1 AFP twice-yearly \nif cirrhotic. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) For end-stage disease or intractable \npruritus. Histological recurrence in the graft: ~17% after 5yrs; although graft failure \ncan occur as a result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable.\nPrognosis Highly variable. The Mayo survival model is a validated predictor of survival \nthat combines age, bilirubin, albumin, PT time, oedema, and need for diuretics.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) \nProgressive cholestasis with bile duct in\ufb02 ammation and strictures (\ufb01 gs 6.30, 6.31).\nSymptoms/signs Pruritus \u00b1 fatigue; if advanced: ascending cholangitis, cirr hosis, and \nhepatic failure. Associations: \u2022 \ue032 sex. \u2022 HLA-A1; B8; DR3. \u2022 AIH (p284); >80% of Northern \nEuropean patients also have IBD, usually UC; this combination is associated with \ue000\ue000risk \nof colorectal malignancy.\nCancers Bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and colon cancers are more common, so do \nyearly colonoscopy + ultrasound; consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps.\n32\nTests \ue000ALP, then \ue000bilirubin; hyper gammaglobulin aemia and/or \ue000IgM; AMA \u03a9ve, but ANA, \nSMA, and ANCA may be +ve; see BOX and p553. ERCP (\ufb01 g 6.30) or MRCP (\ufb01 g 6.31) reveal \nduct anatomy and damage. Liver biopsy shows a \ufb01 brous, obliterative cholangitis.\nTreatment Liver transplant is the mainstay for end-stage disease; recurrence oc-\ncurs in up to 30%; 5yr graft survival is >60%. Prognosis is worse for those with \nIBD, as 5\u201310% develop colorectal cancer post-transplant. Ursodeoxycholic acid may \nimprove LFT but has not shown evidence of survival bene\ufb01 t. High doses, eg 25\u201330mg/\nkg/d, may be harmful. Colestyr amine 4\u20138g/24h PO for pruritus (naltrexone and ri-\nfampicin may also help). Antibiotics for bacterial cholangitis.\n31 Other causes of liver granulomas: TB, sarcoid, infections with HIV (eg toxoplasmosis, CMV, mycobacte-\nria), PAN, SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, syphilis, isoniazid, quinidine, carbamazepine, al-\nlopurinol. Signs: PUO; \ue000LFT.\n32 Usually gallbladder polyps are an incidental \ufb01 nding on ultrasound, and they can often be left if <1cm \ndiameter, but in PSC they are much more likely to become malignant.", "text_length": 4297, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 290/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 289, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.672701", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.673419", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
