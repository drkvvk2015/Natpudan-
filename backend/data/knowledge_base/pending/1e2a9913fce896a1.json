Pressure-\ufb02 ow studies \nhelp diagnose this (as does detrusor thickness \u22652.9mm on US).\nPrimary bladder neck obstruction A condition in which the bladder neck \ndoes not open properly during voiding. Studies in men and women with void-\ning dysfunction show that it is common. The cause may be muscular or neuro-\nlogical dysfunction or \ufb01 brosis. Diagnosis: Video-urodynamics, with simultaneous \npressure-\ufb02 ow measurement, and visualization of the bladder neck during voiding. \nTreatment: Watchful waiting; \ue025-blockers (p642); surgery.\nUrethral stricture This may follow trauma or infection (eg gonorrhoea)\u2014and \nfrequently leads to voiding symptoms, UTI, or retention. Malignancy is a rare cause. \nImaging: Retrograde urethrogram or antegrade cystourethrogram if the patient \nhas an existing suprapubic catheter. Internal urethrotomy involves incising the \nstricture transurethrally using endoscopic equipment\u2014to release scar tissue. \nStents incorporate themselves into the wall of the urethra and keep the lumen \nopen. They work best for short strictures in the bulbar urethra (anterior urethral \nanatomy, from proximal to distal: prostatic urethra\ue003posterior or membranous \nurethra\ue003bulbar urethra\ue003penile or pendulous urethra\ue003fossa navicularis\ue003meatus).\nNot all male urinary symptoms are prostate-related!\nTable 13.20 Managing detrusor overactivity in urge incontinence\nAgents for detrusor overactivity\nNotes\nAntimuscarinics: eg tolterodine SR \n4mg/24h; SE: dry mouth, eyes/skin, \ndrowsiness, constipation, tachycardia, \nabdominal pain, urinary retention, \nsinusitis, oedema, \ue000weight, glaucoma \nprecipitation. Up to 4mg/12h may be \nneeded (unlicensed).\nImproves frequency & urgency. Alternatives: \nsolifena cin 5mg/24h (max 10mg); oxy butynin, \nbut more SE unless transdermal route or modi-\n\ufb01 ed release used; trospium or feso terodine \n(prefers M3 receptors). Avoid in myasthenia, \nand if glaucoma or UC are uncontrolled.\nTopical oestrogens\nPost-menopausal urgency, frequency + noc-\nturia may occasionally be improved by raising \nthe bladder\u2019s sensory threshold. Systemic \ntherapy worsens incontinence.\n\ue0203 adrenergic agonist: mirabegron \n50mg/24h; SE tachycardia; CI: severe HTN; \nCaution if renal/hepatic impairment.\nConsider if antimuscarinics are contrain-\ndicated or clinically ineff ective, or if SE \nunacceptable.\nIntravesical botulinum toxin (Botox\u00ae)\nConsider if above medications ineff ective.\nPercutaneous posterior tibial nerve \nstimulation (PTNS). (A typical treatment \nconsists of \u224812 weekly 30 min sessions.)\nConsider if drug treatment ineff ective and \nBotox\u00ae not wanted. PTNS delivers neuromodu-\nlation to the S2\u2013S4 junction of the sacral nerve \nplexus. \nNeuromodulation via transcutaneous \nelectrical stimulation\nSacral nerve stimulation inhibits the re\ufb02 ex \nbehaviour of involuntary detrusor contractions.\nModulation of aff erent input from \nbladder\nGabapentin (unlicensed).\nHypnosis, psychotherapy, bladder \ntraining*\n(These all require good motivation.)\nSurgery (eg clam ileocystoplasty)\nReserved for troublesome or intractable \nsymptoms. The bladder is bisected, opened \nlike a clam, and 25cm of ileum is sewn in.\nNB: desmopressin nasal spray 20mcg nocte reduces urine production and \ue018 nocturia in overactive bladder. \nUnsuitable if elderly (SE: \ufb02 uid retention, heart failure, \ue001Na\n+).\n*Mind over bladder: \u2022Void when you DON\u2019T have urge; DON\u2019T go to the bathroom when you do have urge. \n\u2022Gradually extend the time between voiding. \u2022Schedule your trips to toilet. \u2022Stretch your bladder to normal \ncapacity. \u2022 When urge comes, calm down and make it go using mind over bladder tricks.", "text_length": 3728, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 657/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 656, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.303750", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.304424", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
