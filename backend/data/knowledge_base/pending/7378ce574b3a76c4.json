Target INR 2\u20133 if aortic \nvalve or 2.5\u20133.5 if mitral valve.\nDuration of anticoagulation in DVT/PE: First episodes of DVT or PE require at least \n3 months of anticoagulation. Consider extending this to 6 months in patients with \nmore extensive, life-threatening clot at presentation, for those with transient but \npersistent risk factors (eg prolonged immobility) or if evidence of persistent clot \nat 3 months. For those with recurrent unprovoked emboli or underlying throm-\nbophilia (p374), consider bleeding risks against bene\ufb01 ts of inde\ufb01 nite treatment.\nWarfarin guidelines and target levels for INR\nBelow is a rough guide to warfarin dosing for target INR of 2\u20133.\nTable 8.5 Suggested dosing for day 3 of warfarin loading\nINR\n<2\n2\n2.5\n2.9\n3.3\n3.6\n4.1\n3rd dose\n5mg\n5mg\n4mg\n3mg\n2mg\n0.5mg\n0mg\nMaintenance\n\u22656mg\n5.5mg\n4.5mg\n4mg\n3.5mg\n3mg\n*\n*Miss a dose; give 1\u20132mg the next day; if INR >4.5, miss 2 doses.\nTable 8.6 When the INR is much too high (see also BNF)\nINR 5\u20138, no bleed\nWithold 1\u20132 doses.

Check INR \ndaily\u2014repeat vitamin K if INR too high after 24h. Restart \nwarfarin at a lower dose when INR <5.\nAny major \nbleed (including \nintracranial \nhaemorrhage)\nStop warfarin. Give prothrombin complex concentrate 50 \nunits/kg (if unavailable, give FFP 15mL/kg \u2248 1L for a 70kg \nman) and 5\u201310mg vitamin K IV. Discuss with haematologist.\n*Minor bleeding includes epistaxis.\nVitamin K may take several hours to work and can cause prolonged resistance \nwhen restarting warfarin, so should be avoided if possible when long-term anti-\ncoagulation is needed. Prothrombin complex concentrate contains a concentrate \nof factors II, VII, IX, and X and provides a more complete and rapid reversal of \nwarfarin than FFP.\nWarfarin dosage and what to do when the INR is much too high", "text_length": 2396, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 359/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 358, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.782006", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.782798", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
