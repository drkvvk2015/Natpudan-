Mainly act as \nanalgesics rather than modifying the disease process per se.\n\ue007\ue007NSAIDs caused ~2000 UK deaths in 2011.13 Individualized risk: bene\ufb01 t analysis for \neach patient (including indication, dose, proposed duration of use, and comorbid-\nity) is crucial and needs careful and experienced thought. Follow local recommen-\ndations and national guidelines where available.\nNSAID side effects: \ue007The main serious side eff ects are GI bleeding (and ulcers and \nperforation), cardiovascular events (MI and stroke), and renal injury. The risks are \ndose related, starting with the \ufb01 rst dose, so always aim to use the lowest possible \ndose for the shortest period of time. Risks increase considerably with age, polyp-\nharmacy, history of peptic ulcers, and renal impairment.\nGI side effects: NICE recommends co-prescription of PPI for any patient aged >45 \nyears, and those with other risk factors for GI bleeding. Drug interactions can \nincrease bleeding risks\u2014avoid concomitant prescribing of anticoagulants, anti-\nplatelet agents, SSRI, spironolactone, steroids, and bisphosphonates. Coxibs are \nslightly lower risk than non-selective NSAIDs.\nCardiovascular side effects: NSAIDS\u2014all are associated with a small increased \nrisk of MI and stroke (independent of cardiovascular risk factor or duration of \nuse).14 Risks are higher in those with concomitant IHD risk factors, eg diabetes and \nhypertension. Coxibs and diclofenac are higher risk, and are contraindicated if \nprior history of MI, PVD, stroke, or heart failure. Naproxen has the lowest cardiovas-\ncular risk. Low-dose celecoxib may be considered for patients on low-dose aspirin \n(if NSAID is required) as it does not interact with it.15\nRenal risks: Higher for patients already on diuretics, ACE, or ARB. Risks are also \nincreased in the elderly, those with hypertension and T2DM. Overall, naproxen \n(<1000mg/day) or ibuprofen (<1200mg/day) plus PPI may be the safest options.\nAlternatives to NSAIDs: Paracetamol, topical NSAIDs, opioids. Strengthening exer-\ncises may be more bene\ufb01 cial than mild oral analgesics.\nCounselling patients: Make sure patients understand about the drugs they are \ntaking: bleeding is more common in those who know less about their drugs.16\n  \n\u2022 Only to take NSAIDs when they need them.\n  \n\u2022 Stop NSAIDs and seek urgent medical review if they develop abdominal pain or \nany symptoms of GI bleeding (eg report black stools \u00b1 faints immediately).\n  \n\u2022 Do not mix prescription NSAIDs with over-the-counter formulations: mixing \nNSAIDS can increase risks 20-fold.\n  \n\u2022 Smoking and alcohol increase risk pro\ufb01 le of NSAIDs.\nPrescribing NSAIDS: bene\ufb01 t vs risk pro\ufb01 ling", "text_length": 2890, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 553/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 552, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.128104", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.128857", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
