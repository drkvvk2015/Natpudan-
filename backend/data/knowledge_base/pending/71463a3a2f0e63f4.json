Locating a focal le-\nsion can be aided by features such as asymmetry (eg one pupil dilated, one upgoing \nplantar response) or a spinal level (eff ects may be symmetrical below the lesion). \n\ue007Note that sometimes there is no single lesion, rather, a general insult causing a \nfalsely localizing sign, eg abducens nerve palsy in \ue000ICP. Other generalized causes of \nspeci\ufb01 c local eff ects are: trauma, encephalitis, anoxia, poisoning, or post-ictal states.\nPatterns of loss Are crucial in locating the lesion (see BOX \u2018From \ufb01 ndings to neu-\nroanatomy\u2019):\nUpper motor neuron (UMN): Patterns of weakness are caused by damage anywhere \nalong the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tracts: pathways that carry motor information \nfrom the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex up to the synapse with anterior horn \ncells in the spinal cord (via the internal capsule, brainstem, and cord).\n1 \u2022UMN weakness \naff ects groups rather than individual muscles, typically in a \u2018pyramidal\u2019 pattern: in \nthe arm, extensors are predominantly aff ected; in the leg the opposite is true and \nthe \ufb02 exors are the weaker muscle group. \u2022Spasticity develops in the stronger muscle \ngroups (arm \ufb02 exors and leg extensors). It manifests as \ue000tone that is velocity-de-\npendent, ie the faster you move the patient\u2019s muscle, the greater the resistance, until \nit \ufb01 nally gives way (like a \u2018clasp-knife\u2019).\n2 \u2022Muscle wasting is less prominent. \u2022 There is \nhyperre\ufb02 exia: re\ufb02 exes are brisk. \u2022 Plantars are upgoing (+ve Babinski sign) \u00b1 clonus \n(elicited by rapidly dorsi \ufb02 exing the foot; \u22643 rhythmic, downward beats of the foot are \nnormal). \u2022Loss of skilled \ufb01 ne \ufb01 nger move ments may be greater than expected from \nthe overall grade of weakness (see BOX \u2018Muscle weakness grading\u2019). \ue007UMN lesions can \nmimic LMN lesions in the \ufb01 rst few hours before spasticity and hyperre\ufb02 exia develop.\nLower motor neuron (LMN): Lesions are caused by damage anywhere from the ante-\nrior horn cells distally, including the nerve roots, plexuses, and peripheral nerves. The \npattern of weakness corresponds to the muscles supplied by the involved neurons. \n\u2022Aff ected muscles show wasting \u00b1 fasciculation (spontaneous  involuntary twitching). \n\u2022There is hypotonia/\ufb02 accidity: the limb feels soft and \ufb02 oppy, providing little resistance \nto passive stretch. \u2022Re\ufb02 exes are reduced or absent; the plantars  remain \ufb02 exor. \ue007The \nchief diff erential for LMN weakness is a primary muscle disease (p510)\u2014but here there \nis symmetrical loss, re\ufb02 exes are normal or lost late, and there is no sensory component.\nMixed LMN and UMN signs: Can occur, eg in MND, \ue001B12, taboparesis (see p466).\nSensory de\ufb01 cits: It is important to test individual modalities and remember the \nquirks of our normal wiring: correctly interpreted, the distribution of sensory loss \nand the modality involved (pain, T\u00b0, touch, vibration, joint-position sense) will help \nre\ufb01 ne and increase your con\ufb01 dence in localizing the lesion (see BOX \u2018From \ufb01 ndings \nto neuroanatomy\u2019). Pain and T\u00b0 sensations travel along small \ufb01 bres in peripheral \nnerves and the anterolateral (spinothalamic) tracts in the cord and brainstem \n(p516), whereas joint-position and vibration sense travel in large \ufb01 bres in peripheral \nnerves and the large dorsal columns of the cord.\n1 Most of the \ufb01 bres of the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tract decussate at the medullary pyramids, hence the \nname and the contralateral nature of symptoms. Extrapyramidal denotes damage to the basal ganglia and \npresents as parkinsonism (see p468, 494).\n2 Whereas with rigidity, \ue000 tone is not velocity-dependent but constant throughout passive movement.\n \u2022 Grade 0 No muscle contraction\n \u2022 Grade 3 Active movement against gravity\n \u2022 Grade 1 Flicker of contraction\n \u2022 Grade 4 Active movement against resistance\n \u2022 Grade 2 Some active movement\n \u2022 Grade 5 Normal power (allowing for age) \nGrade 4 covers a big range: 4\u03a9, 4, and 4+ denote movement against slight, moder-\nate, and stronger resistance; avoid fudging descriptions\u2014\u2018stren gth 4/5 through-\nout\u2019 suggests a mild quadriparesis or myopathy. It is better to document \u2018poor \neff ort\u2019 and the maximum grade for each muscle tested. \ue007Distribution of weakness \ntells us more than grade of weakness (grade does help document improvement). \nMuscle weakness grading (MRC classi\ufb01 cation)", "text_length": 4553, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 454/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 453, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.951016", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.952847", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
