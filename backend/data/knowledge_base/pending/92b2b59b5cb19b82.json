Use Lund and Browder charts (see \ufb01 g 19.27) or the \n\u2018rule of nines\u2019 (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk \n18%; perineum 1%). Ignore erythema. Burn depth determines healing time/scarring; \nassessing this can be hard, even for the experienced. The big distinction is whether \nthe burn is partial thickness (painful, red, and blistered) or full thickness (insensate/\npainless; grey-white). NB: burns can evolve, particularly over the \ufb01 rst 48h.\nResuscitation Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major \nburns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and \ndepth of burn (\ufb01 g 19.27, to help calculate \ufb02 uid requirements). Referral is still war-\nranted in cases of full thickness burns >5%, partial thickness burns >10% in adults or \n>5% in children or the elderly, burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns, \nand burns with inhalational injury.\n  \n\u2022 Airway: Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if hot gases inhaled. Sus-\npect if history of \ufb01 re in enclosed space, soot in oral/nasal cavity, singed nasal hairs \nor hoarse voice. A \ufb02 exible laryngo/bronchoscopy is useful. Involve anaesthetists \nearly and consider early intubation. Obstruction can develop in the \ufb01 rst 24h.\n  \n\u2022 Breathing: Exclude life-threatening chest injuries (eg tension pneumothorax) and \nconstricting burns\u2014consider escharotomy if chest burns are impairing thorax ex-\ncursion (OHCS p766). Give 100% O2. Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning (p842) from \nhistory, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhaemoglobin level (COHb). With 100% O2 t\u00bd \nof COHb falls from 250min to 40min (consider hyperbaric O2 if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; \n>25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO2 (oxim etry) is unreliable in CO poisoning.\n  \n\u2022 Circulation: Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require IV \n\ufb02 uid resuscitation. Put up 2 large-bore (14G or 16G) IV lines. Do not worry if you have \nto put these through burned skin; intraosseous access is valuable in infants and \ncan be used in adults (see OHCS p236). Secure them well: they are literally lifelines.\nUse a burns calculator \ufb02 ow chart or a formula, eg: Parkland formula (popular): 4 \u2248 \nweight (kg) \u2248 % burn = mL Hartmann\u2019s solution in 24h, half given in 1st 8h. Replace \ufb02 u-\nid from the time of burn, not from the time \ufb01 rst seen in hospital. Formulae are only \nguides: adjust IVI according to clinical response and urine output; aim for 0.5mL/kg/h \n(1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury. Monitor \nT\u00b0 (core and surface); catheterize the bladder. Beware of over-resuscitation (\u2018\ufb02 uid \ncreep\u2019) which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.\nTreatment \u2018Cool the burn, warm the patient.\u2019 Do not apply cold water to extensive \nburns for long periods: this may intensify shock. Take care with circumferential full-\nthickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particu-\nlarly after \ufb02 uid resuscitation. Decompress (escharotomy and fasciotomy) as needed. \nIf transferring to a burns unit, do not burst blisters or apply any special creams as \nthis can hinder assessment. Simple saline gauze or paraffi  n gauze is suitable; cling \n\ufb01 lm is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. Titrate morphine IV for good \nanalgesia. Ensure tetanus immunity. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used.\nDe\ufb01 nitive dressings There are many dressings for partial thickness burns, eg bio-\nlogical (pigskin, cadaveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadi azine cream alone or \nwith cerium nitrate as Flammacerium\u00ae; it forms a leathery eschar which resists \ninfection. Major full-thickness burns bene\ufb01 t from early tangential excision and split-\nskin grafts as the burn is a major source of in\ufb02 ammatory cytokines and forms a rich \nmedium for bacterial growth.", "text_length": 4156, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 854/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 853, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.658776", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.659693", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
