The most abundant is albumin (see \n\ufb01 g 14.12).\nAlbumin Synthesized in the liver; t\u00bd \u2248 20d. It binds bilirubin, free fatty acids, Ca\n2+, \nand some drugs. Low albumin: Results in oedema, and is caused by: \u2022\ue001synthesis: \nliver disease, acute phase response (due to \ue000vascular permeability\u2014eg sepsis, trau-\nma, surgery), malabsorption, malnutrition, malignancy \u2022\ue000loss: nephrotic syndrome, \nprotein-losing enteropathy, burns \u2022haemodilution: late pregnancy, artefact (eg from \n\u2018drip\u2019 arm). Also posture (\ue0005g/L if upright) and genetic variations. High albumin: \nCauses are dehydration; artefact (eg stasis).\nImmunoglobulins (Antibodies) are synthesized by B cells. Five isoforms Ig \nA,D,E,G,M exist in humans, and IgG is the most abundant circulating form. Speci\ufb01 c \nmonoclonal band in paraproteinaemia (see p370). Diffusely raised in chronic infec-\ntions, TB, bronchiectasis, liver cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, SLE, RA, Crohn\u2019s disease, 1\u00b0 biliary \ncirrhosis, hepatitis, and parasitaemia. Low in nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption, \nmalnutrition, and immune de\ufb01 ciency states (eg severe illness, renal failure, diabetes \nmellitus, malignancy, or congenital).\nAcute phase response The body responds to a variety of insults with, among other \nthings, the synthesis, by the liver, of a number of proteins (normally present in serum \nin small quantities)\u2014eg \ue0251-antitrypsin, \ufb01 brinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and \nCRP. A concomitant reduction in albumin level, is characteristic of conditions such \nas infection, malignancy (especially \ue0252-fraction), trauma, surgery, and in\ufb02 ammatory \ndisease.\nCRP So called because it binds to a polysaccharide (fraction C) in the cell wall of pneu-\nmococci. Levels help monitor in\ufb02 ammation/infection (normal <8mg/L). Like the ESR, \nit is raised in many in\ufb02 ammatory conditions, but changes more rapidly. It increases \nin hours and begins to fall within 2\u20133d of recovery; thus it can be used to follow \ndisease activity (eg Crohn\u2019s disease) or the response to therapy (eg antibiotics). CRP \nvalues in mild in\ufb02 ammation 10\u201350mg/L; active bacterial infection 50\u2013200mg/L; se-\nvere infection or trauma >200mg/L; see table 14.6.\nUrinary proteins\nUrinary protein loss >150mg/d is pathological (p294).\nAlbuminuria Usually caused by renal disease (p294). Microalbuminuria: Urinary \nprotein loss between 30 and 300mg/d (so not visible on normal dipstick) and may \nbe seen with diabetes mellitus, \ue000BP, SLE, and glomerulonephritis (see p314 for role \nin DM). Can also be quanti\ufb01 ed by measuring the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \n(A:CR), usually a \ufb01 rst-in-the-morning spot urine sample. A level >30mg/mmol indi-\ncates albuminuria, and microalbuminuria is de\ufb01 ned as >2.5mg/mmol in men and >3.5 \nin women. This is a useful screening test in diabetics, and subjects with reduced \neGFR. Note some labs measure total urinary protein not albumin\u2014a P:CR of 50, is \nequivalent to an A:CR of 30.20\nBence Jones protein Consists of light chains excreted in excess by some patients \nwith myeloma (p368). They are not detected by dipsticks and may occur with \nnormal serum electrophoresis.\nHaemoglobinuria Caused by intravascular haemolysis (p336).\nMyoglobinuria Caused by rhabdomyolysis (p319).", "text_length": 3517, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 694/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 693, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.363726", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.364729", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
