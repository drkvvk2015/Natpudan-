The initial presentation is usually of memory loss over months or years (\ue007look \nfor other causes if over days/weeks). Prevalence increases with age: 20% of people \n>80yrs are known to have dementia, yet probably only half of cases are diagnosed.\nDiagnosis Is made by: History from the patient with a thorough collateral nar-\nrative\u2014ask about the timeline of decline and the domains aff ected. Non-cognitive \nsymptoms such as agitation, aggression, or apathy indicate late disease.5 Cognitive \ntesting: Use a validated dementia screen such as the AMTS (p64) or similar, plus short \ntests of executive function and language. Carry out a mental state examination to \nidentify anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. Examination may identify a physical \ncause, risk factors (eg for vascular dementia), or parkinsonism. Medication review \nis important to exclude drug-induced cognitive impairment.\nInvestigations Look for reversible/organic causes: \ue000TSH/\ue001B12/\ue001folate (treat low-\nnormals, p334), \ue001thiamine (eg alcohol), \ue001Ca\n2+. Check MSU, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFT, and glu-\ncose. An MRI (preferred to CT) can identify other reversible pathologies (eg subdural \nhaematoma, p482; normal-pressure hydrocephalus\n11), as well as underlying vascular \ndamage or structural pathology. Functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT) may help de-\nlineate subtypes where diagnosis is not clear. Consider EEG in: suspected delirium, \nfrontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check \nautoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic).\nSubtypes \u2022 Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD): See p488. \u2022 Vascular dementia: (~25%.) Cu-\nmulative eff ect of many small strokes: sudden onset and stepwise deterioration is \ncharacteristic (but often hard to recognize). Look for evidence of arteriopathy (\ue000BP, \npast strokes, focal CNS signs). \ue007Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or me-\nmantine in these patients. \u2022 Lewy body dementia: (15\u201325%.) Fluctuating cognitive \nimpairment, det ailed visual hallucinations, and later, parkinsonism (p494). Histol-\nogy is characterized by Lewy bodies (eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies) \nin brainstem and neocortex. \ue007Avoid using antipsychotics in Lewy body dementia \n(\ue000\ue000risk of SE, see p489). \u2022 Fronto-temporal dementia: Frontal and temporal atrophy \nwith loss of >70% of spindle neurons. Patients display executive impairment; be-\nhavioural/personality change; disinhibition; hyperorality, stereotyped behaviour, and \nemotional unconcern. Episodic memory and spatial orientation are preserved until \nlater stages. Pick\u2019s disease refers to the few fronto-temporal dementia patients who \nhave Pick inclusion bodies on histology (spherical clusters of tau-laden neurons).\nOther causes Alcohol/drug abuse; repeated head trauma; pellagra (p268), Whip-\nple\u2019s disease (p716); Huntington\u2019s (p702); CJD (p696); Parkinson\u2019s (p494); HIV; crypto-\ncoccosis (p408); familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer\u2019s; CADASIL (p470).\nManagement \ue007Refer suspected or diagnosed dementia to integrated memory ser-\nvices for further assessment and management. Medication: (p489). Avoid drugs that \nimpair cognition (eg neuroleptics, sedatives, tricyclics). Non-pharmacological inter-\nventions: Non-cognitive symptoms (eg agitation) may respond to measures such as \naromatherapy, multisensory stimulation, massage, music, and animal-assisted therapy.\nOther considerations \u2022 Depression: Common. Try an SSRI (eg citalopram 10\u201320mg \nOD) or, if severe, mirtazapine (15\u201345mg at night if eGFR >40). Cognitive behavioural \ntherapy can help with social withdrawal and catastrophic thinking. \u2022 Capacity: Can \nthe patient make decisions regarding medical or \ufb01 nancial aff airs? Wherever possible, \nallow them to. Suggest making an advanced directive or appointing a Lasting Power \nof Attorney in the early stages of the disease.\n11 Dilated vent ricles without enlarged sulci.
