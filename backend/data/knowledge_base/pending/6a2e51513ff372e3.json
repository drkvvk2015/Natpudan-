If >48h, ensure \n\u22653wks of therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardio version; NB trans-oe-\nsophageal-guided cardioversion is an option if urgent cardioversion is required. \nUse a DOAC (eg apixaban) or warfarin (target INR 2\u20133) if high risk of emboli (past \nischaemic stroke, TIA, or emboli; \ue00675yrs with \ue000BP, DM; coronary or peripheral arte-\nrial disease; evidence of valve disease or \ue001LV function/CCF\u2014only do echo if unsure). 30 \nUse no anticoagulation if stable sinus rhythm has been restored, no risk factors \nfor emboli, and AF recurrence unlikely (ie no failed cardioversions, no structural \nheart disease, no previous recurrences, no sustained AF for >1yr).\nChronic AF: Chronic AF may be paroxysmal (terminates in <7d but may recur), \npersistent (lasts >7d), or permanent (long-term, continuous AF, sinus rhythm not \nachievable despite treatment). In all cases, the need for anticoagulation should be \nassessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess embolic stroke risk (consider anti-\ncoagulation if score \ue032 >0, \ue033 >1), and balancing this against the risks of anticoagula-\ntion to the patient, assessed with the HAS-BLED score. Long-term anticoagulation \nshould be with a DOAC (see p350) or warfarin.\nCHA2DS2-VASc\u2014Congestive cardiac failure (1 point), Hypertension (1), Age \n65\u201374y (1), Age >74y (2), Diabetes (1), previous Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2), \nVascular disease (1), Sex Category (1 if female).
