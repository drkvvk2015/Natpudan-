Avoid Valsalva maneuver. Assist second stage\nwith forceps\nSTENOTIC VALVULAR HEART DISEASE\nmay worsen\nduring pregnancy. Consider b blockers to decrease HR\nin mitral stenosis. Supportive measures with aggressive\npain control during labor. Avoid fluid overload\nPROSTHETIC HEART VALVE\nfor metal valves, con\ntinue oral anticoagulation until conception, can switch\nto LMWH before 6th week and continue throughout\nfirst trimester and possibly throughout pregnancy (aim\nfor higher anti Xa level). Warfarin, which crosses the\nVALVULAR DISORDERS (CONT\u2019D)\nplacenta and may cause fetal bleeds, may be consid\nered during 2nd and 3rd trimesters for more thrombo\ngenic valves until 36th week, and then switch back to\nunfractionated heparin in preparation for delivery.\nPreconception counseling should be emphasized\nENDOCARDITIS\nPROPHYLAXIS\nnormally\nnot\nrequired for vaginal delivery and cesarean sections;\noptional for high risk lesions (complex congenital\nheart disease, prosthetic heart valve, cardiac transplant\nrecipients with valvuloplasty, previous endocarditis)\nMYOCARDIAL DISORDERS\nPERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY\nT3 to 5 months\npost partum.

Avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs.\nAnticoagulate as risk of thromboembolism. Patients with\nresidual left ventricular dysfunction are at high risk of\nprogression or death with future pregnancies and\nshould be counseled to avoid future pregnancies\nISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE\nmay become more com\nmon in pregnancy.
