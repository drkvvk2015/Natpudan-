May accompany Wernicke\u2019s encephalopa-\nthy. There is \ue001ability to acquire new memories, confabulation (invented memory, \nowing to retrograde amnesia), lack of insight & apathy. \ue057: See Wernicke\u2019s, p714; \npatients rarely recover. \nSergei Sergeievich Korsakoff, 1853\u20131900 (Russian neuropsychiatrist)\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (Histiocytosis X.)

Pulmonary disease \npresents with pneumothorax or pulmonary hypertension.

It may be an early stage of tropical endomyocardial \ufb01 brosis (and \noverlaps with hypereosinophilic syndrome, p330) but is distinct from eosinophilic \nleuk aemia. Signs: Heart failure (75%) \u00b1 mitral regurgitation (49%) \u00b1 heart block. \ue057: \nSuppress the eosin ophilia (prednisolone \u00b1 hydroxycarbamide), and then treat with \nanti-heart failure medication. \nWilhelm L\u00f6f\ufb02 er, 1887\u20131972 (Swiss physician)\nL\u00f6ffl  er\u2019s syndrome (Pulmonary eosinophilia.)

The cause is not completely understood, but may be due \nto paranodal \ufb01 bres that bypass all or part of the atrioventricular node. The patient \nmay complain of intermittent palpitations.50 \n \n Bernard Lown, b1921 (US cardiologist); William F Ganong, 1924\u20132007 (US physiologist); Samuel A Levine, 1891\u20131966 (US cardiologist)\nMcArdle\u2019s glycogen storage disease (type V) Absence of muscle phosphorylase \nenzyme with resulting inability to convert glycogen into glucose (eg R50X mutation of \nPYGM gene; autosomal recessive). Fatigue & crises of cramps \u00b1 hyperthermia. Rhab-\ndomyolysis/myoglobinuria follow exercise. Tests: \ue000\ue000CK. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic \n(necrosis and atrophy). \ue057: Mod erate aerobic exercise helps (by utilizing alternative \nfuel substrates).51 Avoid heavy exertion and statins. Sucrose pre-exercise improves \nperformance, as does a carbohydrate-rich diet.
