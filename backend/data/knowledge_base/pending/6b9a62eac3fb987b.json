Pathogenesis is \nunclear although the platelet theory was developed in 1987.16 Megakaryocytes are \nnormally fragmented into platelets in the lungs, and the original theory was that \nany disruption to normal pulmonary circulation (in\ufb02 ammation, cancer, cardiac \nright-to-left shunting) would allow large megakaryocytes into the systemic cir-\nculation. They become lodged in the capillaries of the \ufb01 ngers and toes, releasing \nplatelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which lead \nto tissue growth, vascular permeability, and recruitment of in\ufb02 ammatory cells. \nEvidence showing platelet microthrombi in clubbed \ufb01 ngers, and high levels of PDGF \nand VEGF in patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, support the theory. This \ndoes not explain the changes in patients with unilateral clubbing, usually seen in \nneurological disorders.\nCauses\nThoracic:\nGI:\nCardiovascular:\n  \u2022 Bronchial cancer (clubbing is \ntwice as common in women); \nus u ally not small cell cancer\n  \u2022 Chronic lung suppuration:\n  \n\u2022 Empyema, abscess\n  \n\u2022 Bronchiectasis\n  \n\u2022 Cystic \ufb01 brosis\n  \n\u2022 Fibrosing alveolitis\n  \n\u2022 Mesothelioma\n  \n\u2022 TB.\n  \n\u2022 In\ufb02 ammatory bowel dis-\nease (especially Crohn\u2019s)\n  \n\u2022 Cirrhosis\n  \n\u2022 GI lymphoma\n  \u2022 Malabsorption, eg coeliac.\nRare:\n  \n\u2022 Familial\n  \u2022 Thyroid acropachy (p562).\n  \n\u2022 Cyanotic \ncong enital heart \ndisease\n  \n\u2022 Endocarditis\n  \n\u2022 Atrial myxoma\n  \n\u2022 Aneurysms\n  \u2022 Infected grafts.\nUnilateral clubbing:\n  \u2022 Hemiplegia\n  \n\u2022 Vascular lesions, eg upper-limb artery aneurysm, Takayasu\u2019s arteritis, brachial \narteriovenous malformations (including iatrogenic\u2014 haemodialysis \ufb01 stulas).\nClubbing\nNodules and contractures\n  \n\u2022 Dupuytren\u2019s contracture (see \ufb01 g 2.26, p60) \ufb01 brosis \nand contrac ture of palmar fascia, p698) is seen in \nliver disease, trauma, epilepsy, and ageing.\n  \n\u2022 Look for Heberden\u2019s (DIP) \ufb01 g 2.45 and Bouchard\u2019s \n(PIP) \u2018nodes\u2019\u2014osteophytes (bone over-growth at a \njoint) seen with osteoarthritis.\nFig 2.45 Heberden\u2019s (DIP).\nReproduced from Watts et al.
