Look for preventable and reversible pathology. Old age \ndoes not cause disease (although it can increase vulnerability and recovery time).\n\ue007Look for ways to reduce disability and support older people in their own homes.\nDiff erences in the evaluation of the older person\n1   Multiple pathologies: Elderly patients have, on average, six diagnosable disor-\nders. Eff ects may be multiplicative. Treatment must be integrated.\n2   Multiple aetiologies: One problem may have several causes, eg falls. Treating \neach alone may do little good, treating all may be of great bene\ufb01 t.\n3   Non-speci\ufb01 c/atypical presentation: Delirium, dizziness, falls, mobility prob-\nlems, weight loss, and incontinence can be due to disorders in more than one \norgan system. Typical signs and symptoms may be absent. Ask about functional \ndecline in activities of daily living\u2014this may be the only symptom.\n4   Missed or delayed diagnosis: The older person may decline quickly if treat-\nment is delayed. Complications are common. Use a collateral history: what is the \npatient usually like?\n5   Pharmacy and polypharmacy: NSAIDS, anticoagulants, anti-parkinson drugs, \nhypoglycaemic drugs, and psychoactive drugs can pose a particular risk in the \nolder patient. Double check for interactions. Consider body weight, liver and re-\nnal function\u2014drug doses may need to be modi\ufb01 ed. The STOPP/START criteria detail \n>100 potentially inappropriate prescriptions and prescribing omissions relevant \nto the older patient.21\n6   Prolonged recovery time: Anticipate and plan for this. Don\u2019t forget nutrition.\n7   Rehabilitation and social factors: Essential for healthy ageing.\nFalls\n50% aged >80 will fall at least once per year. Falls23 lead to injury, pain, distress, loss \nof con\ufb01 dence, loss of independence, and mortality. Cost to the NHS is \u00a32.3bn/year.\n  \n\u2022 History: frequency, context and circumstances, severity, injuries.\n  \n\u2022 Multifactorial risk assessment: gait, balance, muscle strength, osteoporosis risk, \nperceived functional ability, fear of falls, vision, cognition, neurological examina-\ntion, continence, home and hazards, cardiovascular examination, medication re-\nview.\n  \n\u2022 Interventions: strength and balance training, home hazard intervention, correct \nvision, modi\ufb01 cation/withdrawal of medication (cardiovascular, psychotropic), in-\ntegrated management of contributing morbidities. Consider barriers to change, \neg fear, patient preference.\nHistory: In addition to routine elements, include function in activities of daily liv-\ning, continence, and social support. Ask if there is an advanced care directive and \nnominated proxy healthcare decision maker.\nExamination:\n  \n\u2022 Appearance and aff ect: hygiene, nutrition, hydration. Brie\ufb02 y assess mood.\n  \n\u2022 Senses: vision, hearing, assess swallowing with 20mL of water.\n  \n\u2022 Cognition: brief screening test, eg AMTS (p64), 2-step command.\n  \n\u2022 Pulse and blood pressure: lying/sitting and standing.\n  \n\u2022 Peripheral neurological exam: tone, power, wasting, active range of movement.\n  \n\u2022 Other periphery: pulses, oedema, skin integrity, pressure areas.\n  \n\u2022 Walking: stand patient, balance, transfers, observe gait (be ready to assist).\n  \n\u2022 Other systems: CV, respiratory, abdomen (don\u2019t forget to palpate for bladder).22\nA quick ward assessment of the older person", "text_length": 3935, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 28/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 27, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.902730", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.903675", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
