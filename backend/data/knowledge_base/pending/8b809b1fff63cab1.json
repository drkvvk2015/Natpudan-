If using rapid ac meals, a small dose of basal\ninsulin will be necessary in the morning as well\n\u0002\nTWO-THIRDS, ONE-THIRD RULE\nif a patient is unable\nto do multiple daily injections, consider the two\nthirds, one third rule, which establishes a baseline\nfor insulin administration using the two main types\nof insulin (intermediate acting and fast acting). AM\ndose (given before breakfast) = 2/3 of total daily\ninsulin (2/3=N, 1/3=R), supper dose = 1/3 of total\ndaily insulin (2/3=N, 1/3=R)\n\u0002\nBEDTIME INSULIN\npatients with type 2 diabetes who\nare on maximum oral hypoglycemic agents may be\nstarted on bedtime insulin at 0.1 units/kg to improve\ncontrol using either NPH, Lantus, or Levemir\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\u0002\nDELAY DOSE\npatients may need to delay their\ninsulin intake at times (e.g. if they were NPO for\nprocedures). For every hour delay in giving NPH,\nsubtract 10% of dose\n\u0002\nRENAL FAILURE\ninsulin is renally excreted, thus its\ndose must be reduced in patients with renal failure\n\u0002\nMETFORMIN AND INSULIN\nconsider the use of met\nformin in conjunction with insulin in type 2 dia\nbetics to increase insulin sensitivity and decrease\ninsulin requirements\n\u0002\nTHIAZOLIDINEDIONES AND INSULIN\navoid using thia\nzolidinediones (e.g. rosiglitazone) in combination\nwith insulin as both medications promote fluid\nretention\n\u0002 b-BLOCKERS USE IN\nDIABETICS\nnon selective b\nblockers may mask signs and symptoms of hypo\nglycemia. Consider use of cardioselective b\nblocker agents in diabetics\nREGULAR INSULIN DOSE ADJUSTMENT PRINCIPLES\nINSULIN ADJUSTMENTS\nunderstanding the phar\nmacokinetics of different insulin types is essential for\nfine adjustments of insulin regimen. Blood sugar is\nchecked 4 times/day, before meals and at bedtime\n\u0002\nHIGH AM BLOOD SUGAR\ncheck 3 AM glucose first to\nsee if there is nocturnal hypoglycemia. The bed\ntime basal insulin would have to be decreased. If\nthe 3 AM glucose is high, then increase the bed\ntime basal insulin\n\u0002\nHIGH LUNCH TIME BLOOD SUGAR\nshould increase\nbreakfast insulin R dose\n\u0002\nHIGH SUPPER TIME BLOOD SUGAR\nshould increase\nnoon insulin R dose or morning basal dose\n\u0002\nHIGH BEDTIME BLOOD SUGAR\nshould increase sup\nper insulin R dose\nTYPES OF INSULIN\nInsulin type/action\nTrade names\nRapid acting (clear)\nOnset: 10 15 min\nPeak: 1 1.5 h\nDuration: 3 5 h\nHumalog (insulin\nlispro)\nNovoRapid (insulin\naspart)\nShort acting (clear)\nOnset: 30 min\nPeak: 2 3 h\nDuration: 6.5 h\nHumulin R\nNovolin ge Toronto\nIntermediate acting (cloudy)\nOnset: 1 3 h\nPeak: 5 8 h\nDuration: up to 18 h\nHumulin N\nNovolin ge NPH\nLong acting basal insulin\nanalogues (clear)\nOnset: 90 min\nDuration: up to 24 h\nInsulin detemir\n(Levemir)\nInsulin glargine\n(Lantus)\nPremixed\nPremixed regular insulin\nNPH (cloudy)\nPremixed insulin\nanalogues (cloudy)\nHumulin 30/70\nNovolin ge 30/70\nNovolin ge 40/60\nNovolin ge 50/50\nHumalog Mix 25\nHumalog Mix 50\nNovo Mix 30\nCanadian Diabetes Association Guidelines 2008\nPrinciples of Insulin Use\n341", "text_length": 3507, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 349/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 348, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.728548", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.729293", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
