Incidence: \n5\u201311/1000, \ue000 if very young or old (30% are under 65yrs). Mortality: ~21% in hospital.\nClassi\ufb01 cation and causes\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia: (CAP) May be primary or secondary to under-\nlying disease. Typical organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae (commonest), Hae-\nmophilus in\ufb02 uenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Atypicals: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, \nStaphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, and Chlamydia. Gram-negative bacilli, \nCoxiella burnetii and anaerobes are rarer (?aspiration). Viruses account for up to \n15%. Flu may be complicated by community-acquired MRSA pneumonia.\nHospital-acquired: De\ufb01 ned as >48h after hospital admission. Most commonly \nGram-negative enterobacteria or Staph. aureus. Also Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, \nBacteroides, and Clostridia.\nAspiration: Those with stroke, myasthenia, bulbar palsies, \ue001consciousness (eg post-\nictal or intoxicated), oesophageal disease (achalasia, re\ufb02 ux), or poor dental hygiene \nrisk aspirating oropharyngeal anaerobes.\nImmunocompromised patient: Strep. pneumoniae, H. in\ufb02 uenzae, Staph. aureus, \nM. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, Gram \u03a9ve bacilli and Pneumocystis jirovecii (for-\nmerly named P. carinii, pp400\u20131). Other fungi, viruses (CMV, HSV), and mycobacteria.\nClinical features Symptoms: Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, \npurulent sputum, haemoptysis, and pleuritic pain. Signs: Pyrexia, cyanosis, confus-\nion (can be the only sign in the elderly\u2014may also be hypothermic), tachypnoea, \ntachycardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (reduced expansion, dull percus-\nsion, \ue000tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), and a pleural rub.\nTests Assess oxygenation: oxygen saturation, p162 (ABGs if SaO2 <92% or severe \npneumonia) and BP. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP (GPs should consider a point of care \nCRP to guide antibiotic prescribing where LRTI is suspected, NICE 20144).\nCXR (\ufb01 g 16.2, p723): lobar or multilobar in\ufb01 ltrates, cavitation, or pleural eff usion. Spu-\ntum for microscopy and culture. Urine: check for Legionella/Pneumococcal urinary \nantigens. Atypical organism/viral serology (PCR sputum/BAL, complement \ufb01 xation \ntests acutely, paired serology). Pleural \ufb02 uid may be aspirated for culture. Respira-\ntory physicians may consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if patient \nis immunocompromised or on ITU.\nSeverity \u2018CURB-65\u2019 is a simple, validated severity scoring system.5, 6 1 point for each of:\nConfusion (abbreviated mental test \u22648)\nUrea >7mmol/L\nRespiratory rate \u226530/min\nBP <90 systolic and/or 60mmHg diastolic)\nAge \u226565.\n0\u20131, PO antibiotic/home treatment; 2, hospital therapy; \u22653, severe pneumonia indicates \nmortality 15\u201340%\u2014consider ITU.

Antibiotics\u2014refer to your local hospital antibiotic policy. When \nnone exists, consult table 4.2. If pneumonia not severe and not vomiting (CURB-65 1\u20132) \ngive PO antibiotic; severe (CURB-65 >2) give IV. Oxygen: keep PaO2 >8.0 and/or satura-\ntion \u226594%.
