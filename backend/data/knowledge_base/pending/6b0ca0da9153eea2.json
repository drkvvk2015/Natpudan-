Risk factors: poverty, malnutrition, displace-\nment, deforestation, dam building/irrigation. Presentation:\n  \n\u2022 Cutaneous, most common form, ulceration (\ufb01 g 9.56, p440).\n  \n\u2022 Mucocutaneous (\ufb01 g 9.32): leads to tissue destruction of \nnose, mouth, throat. 90% occurs in Bolivia, Brazil, Peru.\n  \u2022 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala-azar, \u2018black sickness\u2019) (\ufb01 g \n9.33): fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia. \n>95% mortality without treatment. Endemic in Indian sub-\ncontinent, East Africa. 90% of new cases occur in Bangla-\ndesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan, Sudan. 300 000 \ncases/yr, 20 000 deaths/yr. Post kala-azar is a complication \nof Leishmania donovani = a hypopigmented macular/nodular \nrash (\ue031\ue031 leprosy), 6 months\u20131yr after apparent cure, can heal \nbut is a reservoir for parasites and maintains transmission.\nDiagnosis: Clinical. Microscopy of tissue samples (skin, bone \nmarrow) for parasite. Antibody detection in VL (indirect \ufb02 uores-\ncence, ELISA, western blot, direct agglutination test, or immuno-\nchromatographic test) is limited due to: 1 Ab levels detectable \nfor years after cure, cannot distinguish VL relapse/active infec-\ntion. 2 Tests are +ve in many with no history of VL. 3 Serology \nmay be \u03a9ve if HIV +ve. Treatment: Liposomal amphoterin (single \ndose), oral miltefosine, pentavalent antimonials (resistance in \nIndia). The WHO Kala-azar Elimination Programme (including \ndonated liposomal amphotericin) has achieved a 75% reduction \nin new cases of VL.\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness)\nInfection with Trypanosoma protozoan parasites16, trans-\nmitted by the tsetse \ufb02 y in sub-Saharan Africa. Divided into:\n  \n\u2022 Rhodesiense HAT, incubation <21d, high fever, GI disturbance, lymphadenopathy, \nheadache. Chancre at bite site in ~84%, maculopapular rash. Progresses to myo-\npericarditis, arrhythmias, and neurological symptoms.\n  \n\u2022 Gambiense HAT, chronic disease in African population, presents years after infec-\ntion (can present with acute febrile illness in travellers). Low-grade fever. Sleep \ndisorder: reversal of sleep\u2013wake cycle, uncontrollable sleep episodes. Weakness, \nabnormal gait, psychiatric symptoms.\nDiagnosis: \ue001Hb, \ue001plt, AKI, \ue000LFTs, polyclonal \ue000IgM. Microscopy of parasite (blood, \nlymph node, chancre, CSF). Serology and PCR if available. Treatment: According to \ndisease type and stage. Available from WHO. Includes suramin, melarsoprol, pentami-\ndine, nifurtimox-e\ufb02 ornithine. Seek specialist advice\u2014side-eff ects from all.\nChagas\u2019 disease (American trypanosomiasis)\nLife-threatening illness due to protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi transmitted by triatomine \nbugs. Endemic in Latin America: ~6\u20137 million infected. Presentation: Acute phase (~2 \nmonths): skin lesion (chagoma), fever, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, unilateral \nconjunct ivitis, periorbital oedema (Rom a\u00f1a\u2019s sign), myocard itis, meningo encephalitis. \nChronic phase (yrs): cardiac: dilated cardiomyopathy; GI: mega -oesophagus (dysph-\nagia, aspiration), mega-colon (abdominal distension, constip ation); CNS symptoms. \nDiagnosis: Acute: trypomastigotes in blood, CSF, node aspirate. Chronic: serology \n(Chagas\u2019 IgG ELISA). Treatment: Benznidazole, nifurtimox. \ue001eff ective in chronic disease.\nRelapsing fever\nCaused by spirochaete Borrelia recurrentis (louse-borne, sub-Saharan Africa, refu-\ngee camps) or other Borrelia (tick-borne, world-wide). Presentation: Intermittent \nfever \u2018crisis\u2019 due to antigenic variation (~3d fever, then afebrile ~7d), headache, \nmyalgia, \ue001BP. Diagnosis: Spirochaetes on blood smear, false +ve serology for Lyme \ndisease. Treatment: Doxycyline/macrolides (single dose if louse-borne). Neuroborre-\nliosis treatment if CNS disease (p422). Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction due to endotoxins \n(?TNF\ue025) can mimic fever \u2018crisis\u2019: observe 1st ~4h treatment, use cooling/antipyretics.\nFig 9.32 Mucocutane-\nous leishmaniasis.\nReproduced with permis-\nsion from World Health \nOrganization. \u00a9 World \nHealth Organization. http://\nwww.who.int/leishmaniasis/mu-\ncocutaneous_leishmaniasis/en/\nFig 9.33 Visceral \nleishmaniasis.\nReproduced with permis-\nsion from World Health \nOrganization. \u00a9 World \nHealth Organization. http://\nwww.who.int/leishmaniasis/\nvisceral_leishmaniasis/en/", "text_length": 4476, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 431/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 430, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.914419", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.915284", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
