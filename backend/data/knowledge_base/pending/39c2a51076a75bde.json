Does the eGFR re\ufb02 ect the true GFR (p669)? Is \nthe eGFR corrected for ethnicity/drugs (eg trimethoprim alters creatinine con-\ncentration but not GFR)? Evidence of chronicity, ie >3 months\u2014is there a previous \ncreatinine on record?\n  \n\u2022 Possible cause: Ask about previous UTI, lower urinary tract symptoms, PMH of \n\ue000BP, DM, IHD, systemic disorder, renal colic. Check drug history including when \nmedications started. Family history including renal disease and subarachnoid \nhaemorrhage. Systems review: look out for more than is immediately obvious, \nconsider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive \nof systemic disorder (\u2018When did you last feel well?\u2019) and malignancy.\n  \n\u2022 Current state: Patients may have symptomatic CKD if GFR <30. Includes symp-\ntoms of \ufb02 uid overload (SOB, peripheral oedema), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, rest-\nless legs, fatigue, weakness, pruritus, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence.\nExamination\n  \n\u2022 Periphery: Peripheral oedema. Signs of peripheral vascular disease or neuropa-\nthy. A vasculitic rash. Gouty tophi. Joint disease. Arteriovenous \ufb01 stula (thrill, \nbruit, recently needling?). Signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids, \nskin malignancy. Uraemic \ufb02 ap/encephalopathy if GFR <15.\n  \n\u2022 Face: Anaemia, xanthelasma, yellow tinge (uraemia), jaundice (hepatorenal), \ngum hypertrophy (ciclosporin), Cushingoid (steroids), periorbital oedema (ne-\nphrotic syndrome), taut skin/telangiectasia (scleroderma), facial lipodystrophy \n(glomerulonephritis).\n  \n\u2022 Neck: JVP for \ufb02 uid state, tunnelled line (if removed, look for small scar over in-\nternal jugular, and a larger scar in \u2018breast pocket\u2019 area), scar from parathyroid-\nectomy, lymphadenopathy.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiovascular: BP, sternotomy, cardiomegaly, stigmata of endocarditis. If \nright-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not re\ufb02 ect \ufb02 uid state.\n  \n\u2022 Respiratory: Pulmonary oedema or eff usion.\n  \n\u2022 Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below \numbilicus and to side of midline), signs of previous transplant (scar, palpable \ngraft), ballotable polycystic kidneys \u00b1 palpable liver.\nInvestigation\n  \n\u2022 Blood: U&E (compare with previous), Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia), \nglucose (DM), \ue001Ca\n2+, \ue000PO4\n3 \u03a9, \ue000PTH (renal osteodystrophy). Directed investigation \nof intrinsic renal disease: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, paraprotein, \ncomplement, cryoglobulin, anti-GBM, hepatitis serology, anti-PLA2R (membranous \nnephropathy). Note: ESR is not helpful as \ue000 in CKD and proteinuric states.\n  \n\u2022 Urine: Dipstick, MC&S, A:CR or P:CR (p294), Bence Jones.\n  \n\u2022 Imaging: USS for size, symmetry, anatomy, corticomedullary diff erentiation, and \nto exclude obstruction. In CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in in\ufb01 ltrative \ndisorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM. If asymmetrical consider renovas-\ncular disease. Scarring may be seen on USS but isotope scans are more sensitive.\n  \n\u2022 Histology: Consider renal biopsy (p310) in progressive disease, nephrotic syn-\ndrome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treat-\nment if GFR stable and P:CR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need \nbiopsy unless atypical, ie nephrotic, haematuria, other systemic symptoms. \nGFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk. If \nhigh risk, monitor every 6 months (\ufb01 g 7.5, orange), if very high risk, monitor at \nleast every 3\u20134 months (\ufb01 g 7.5, red). Small \ufb02 uctuations are common but a drop in \neGFR stage with \ue001eGFR \u2265 25% is signi\ufb01 cant. Rapid progression is \ue001eGFR >5/yr.\nRisk factors for decline: \ue000BP, DM, metabolic disturbance, volume depletion, infec-\ntion, NSAIDs, smoking. All CKD has \ue000risk of superimposed AKI and needs monitoring \nand prompt treatment during intercurrent illness. \nMonitoring renal function in CKD\nThe patient with CKD: a clinical approach", "text_length": 4039, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 311/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 310, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.703813", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.704442", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
