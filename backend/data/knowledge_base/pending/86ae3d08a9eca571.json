This bell-shaped graph (\ufb01 g 17.2) is the \ntheoretical basis of reference intervals, and explains \u2018lab error\u2019\u2014why some tests \nrepeated at close intervals may reveal slightly diff erent values. Hb for example, \nhas a lab error of ~5g/L. This emphasizes the importance of the clinical picture in \ndecision-making, rather than treating the numbers alone: don\u2019t subject anaemic \npatients to blood transfusions unless they have a clinical need. See p324.\n  \n\u2022 Range is the lowest and highest value of all observations in the set being studied.\n  \n\u2022 Arithmetic mean is the sum of all observations \u00f7 by the number of observations.\n  \n\u2022 Median is the middle value (eg 9 data points are higher and 9 are lower). If their \ndistribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean.\n  \n\u2022 Standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance (the average of the \nsquare of the distance of each data point from the mean). When the distribution of \nthe observations is Normal, 95% of observations are located in the interval \u2018mean \u00b1 \n1.96 SD\u2019. This is the basis of the reference interval.\n  \n\u2022 Standard error of the mean gives an estimate of the reliability of the mean of a \nsample representing the mean of the population from which the sample was taken, \nand is the SD of the sample \u00f7 by the square root of the number of observations \nin the sample. Thus the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error of \nthe mean\u2014the basis of ensuring that clinical trial evidence is based upon enough \nobservations to be con\ufb01 dent that diff erences seen between groups do not occur \nby chance alone.\nFig 17.2 Normal (Gaussian) distribution curve.\nReproduced from Bhopal, Concepts of Epidemiology, 2008, \nwith permission from Oxford University Press.", "text_length": 1916, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 759/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 758, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.482172", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.483206", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
