Classify accord-\ning to optimal binding temperature to RBCs: Warm AIHA: IgG-mediated, bind \nat body T\u00b0 37\u00b0C. \ue057: Steroids/immunosuppressants (\u00b1 splenectomy). Cold AIHA: \nIgM-mediated, bind at \ue001T\u00b0 (<4\u00b0C), activating cell-surface complement. Causes a \nchronic anaemia made worse by cold, often with Raynaud\u2019s or acrocyanosis. \ue057: \nkeep warm. Chloram bucil may help. Causes: most are idiopathic; 2\u00b0 causes of \nwarm AIHA include lympho proliferative disease (CLL, lymphoma), drugs, autoim-\nmune disease, eg SLE. Cold AIHA may follow infection (mycoplasma; EBV).\n  \n\u2022 Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria: seen with viruses/syphilis. It is caused by \nDonath\u2013Landsteiner antibodies sticking to RBCS in the cold, causing self-limit-\ning complement-mediated haemolysis on rewarming.\n  \n\u2022 Isoimmune: acute transfusion reaction (p349); haemolysis of the newborn. \n2  Direct antiglobulin/Coombs \u03a9ve AIHA: (2% of all AIHA.) Autoimmune hepatitis; \nhepatitis B & C; post \ufb02 u and other vaccinations; drugs (piperacillin, rituximab). \n3 Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA): Mechanical damage to RBCS in circula-\ntion, causing intravascular haemolysis and schistocytes (\ufb01 gs 8.30, 8.31). Causes include \nhaemolytic\u2013uraemic syndrome (HUS), TTP (p315), DIC, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia. \nProsthetic heart valves can also cause mechanical damage.\n4  Infection: Malaria (p416): RBC lysis and \u2018blackwater fever\u2019 (haemoglobinuria). \ue007All \ninfections can exacerbate haemolysis.\n5 Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Rare acquired stem cell disorder, with \nhaemolysis (esp. at night\ue003haem oglobinuria, \ufb01 g 15.8, p705), marrow failure + \nthrombophilia. Tests: urinary haemosiderin +ve; if suspect in Coombs -ve \nintravascular haemolysis, seek con\ufb01 rmation by \ufb02 ow cytometry. \ue057: anti coagulation; \nmonoclonal anticomplement antibodies (eg eculizumab); stem cell transplantation.\nHereditary\n1  Enzyme defects:\n  \n\u2022 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de\ufb01 ciency (X-linked): the chief \nRBC enzyme defect, aff ects 100 million (mainly \ue032) in Mediterranean, Africa, \nMiddle/Far East.  Most are asymptomatic, but may get oxidative crises due to \n\ue001gluta thione production, precipitated by drugs (eg primaquine, sulfonamides, \naspirin), exposure to Vicia faba (broad beans/favism), or illness. In attacks, there \nis rapid anaemia and jaundice. Film: bite- and blister-cells (\ufb01 gs 8.32, 8.33). Tests: \nEnzyme assay (>8wks after crisis as young RBCs may have enough enzyme so \nresults normal). \ue057: Avoid precipitants (eg, henna, \ufb01 g 8.34); transfuse if severe.\n  \u2022 Pyruvate kinase de\ufb01 ciency (AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE): \ue001ATP production causes \ue001RBC \nsurvival. Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice; later, haemolysis with splenomeg-\naly \u00b1 jaundice. Tests: enzyme assay. \ue057: often not needed; splenectomy may help.\n2  Membrane defects: All are Coombs \u03a9ve; all need folate; splenectomy helps some.\n  \n\u2022 Hereditary spherocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): prevalence: 1:3000. Less de-\nformable spherical RBCS, so trapped in spleen \ue003 extravascular haemolysis. Signs: \nSplenomegaly, jaundice. Tests: Mild if Hb >110g/L and reticulocytes <6%; \ufb01 lm: \ufb01 g \n8.35. \ue000 Bilirubin (\ue003gallstones).\n  \n\u2022 Hereditary elliptocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): \ufb01 lm: \ufb01 g 8.36. Mostly asympto-\nmatic (somewhat protects from malaria). 10% display a more severe phenotype \n(\u00b1 death in utero).\n  \n\u2022 Hereditary ovalocytosis and stomatocytosis are rarer. Refer to a haematologist.\n3  Haemoglobinopathy: \u2022 Sickle-cell disease (p340). \u2022 Thalassaemia (p342).", "text_length": 3963, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 346/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 345, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.758752", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.759657", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
