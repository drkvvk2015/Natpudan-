Upper and lower motor neurons can be aff ected but there is no \nsensory loss or sphincter disturbance, thus distinguishing MND from MS and poly-\nneuropathies. MND never aff ects eye movements, distinguishing it from myasthenia \n(p512). There are four clinical patterns:\n1   ALS/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (Archetypal MND; up to 80%.) Loss of motor \nneurons in motor cortex and the anterior horn of the cord, so combined UMN + LMN \nsigns (p446). Worse prognosis if: bulbar onset, \ue000age; \ue001FVC.\n2  Progressive bulbar palsy. (10\u201320%.) Only aff ects cranial nerves IX\u2013XII. See BOX \n\u2018Bulbar and corticobulbar (\u2018pseudobulbar\u2019) palsy\u2019.\n3  Progressive muscular atrophy. (<10%.) Anterior horn cell lesion, so LMN signs \nonly. Aff ects distal muscle groups before proximal. Better prognosis than ALS.\n4  Primary lateral sclerosis. (Rare.) Loss of Betz cells in motor cortex: mainly UMN \nsigns, marked spastic leg weakness and pseudobulbar palsy. No cognitive decline.\nPresentation Think of MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stum-\nbling spastic gait, foot-drop \u00b1 proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don\u2019t \nturn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is hard), or aspiration pneumonia. Look \nfor UMN signs: spasticity, brisk re\ufb02 exes, \ue000plantars; and LMN signs: wasting, fascic-\nulation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh. Is speech or swallowing aff ected (bulbar \nsigns)? Fasciculation is not enough to diagnose an LMN lesion: look for weakness too. \nFrontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25% (see BOX \u2018Dignity and Dignitas\u2019).\nDiagnostic criteria (See BOX \u2018Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS\u2019). There \nis no diagnostic test. Brain/cord MRI helps exclude structural causes, LP helps exclude \nin\ufb02 ammatory ones, and neurophysiology can detect subclinical denervation and help \nexclude mimicking motor neuropathies.\n14\nPrognosis Poor, <3yrs post onset in half of patients.\nManagement Adopt a multidisciplinary approach: neurologist, palliative nurse, \nhosp ice, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services\u2014all orchestrated by \nthe GP. Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release and NMDA receptor antagonist, \nis the only medication shown to improve survival. Mulitple other drugs that have \nshown promise in animal models have failed to prove bene\ufb01 t in clinical trials, includ-\ning neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic agents, antioxidants, and immunomodu-\nlatory drugs. For supportive/symptomatic treatment: Excess saliva: Advise on \npositioning, oral care, and suctioning. Try an antimuscarinic (eg propantheline) or \nglycopyrronium bromide (can be given SC). Botulinum toxin A may help. Dysphagia: \nBlend food. Gastrostomy is an option\u2014discuss early on. Spasticity: Exercise, orthot-\nics. See MS for drugs (p496). Communication dif\ufb01 culty: Provide \u2018augmentative and \nalternative\u2019 communication equipment. End-of-life care: \ue007Involve palliative care \nteam from diagnosis (p532). Consider opioids to relieve breathlessness and discuss \nnon-invasive ventilation (see BOX \u2018Dignity and Dignitas\u2019). \n14 If no UMN signs and distal arm muscles are aff ected in the distribution of individual nerves, suspect \nmultifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (diagnose on nerve conduction studies; \ue057: IV Ig). \nGyn aeco mastia, atrophic testes \u00b1 infertility suggests Kennedy syndrome (bulbospinal muscular atrophy).", "text_length": 3650, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 514/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 513, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.060648", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.061654", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
