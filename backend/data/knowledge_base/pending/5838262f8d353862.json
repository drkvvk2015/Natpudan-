No historical findings help rule out the diagnosis by\ntheir absence. Among physical examination findings, synovitis makes the diagnosis of temporal arteritis less likely,\nwhile beaded, prominent, enlarged, and tender temporal arteries each increase the likelihood of positive biopsy\nresults. While these findings increase the chance of having temporal arteritis, they are variably sensitive from 16%\n(beaded temporal artery) to 65% (any temporal artery abnormality). The results of tests of ESR alter the likelihood of\npositive biopsy results. A normal ESR or ESR <50 mm/hr each make positive biopsy results unlikely. Among patients\nclinically suspected of disease, those with an ESR >100 mm/hr have a modestly increased likelihood of biopsy proven\ntemporal arteritis. The prevalence of temporal arteritis in the general population is <1%, while it is 39% for those\nreferred for temporal artery biopsy, suggesting that clinicians are fairly good at identifying high risk patients\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2002 287:1\n290\nVasculitis", "text_length": 3317, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 299/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 298, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.656497", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.657391", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
