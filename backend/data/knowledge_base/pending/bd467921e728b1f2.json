B12 helps \nsynthesize thymidine, and hence DNA, so in de\ufb01 ciency RBC production is slow. \nUntreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (p332) and irreversible CNS compli-\ncations. \ue007  Body stores of B12 are suffi  cient for 4yrs.\nCauses of de\ufb01 ciency \u2022 Dietary (eg vegans: B12 is found in meat, \ufb01 sh, and dairy \nproducts, but not in plants). \u2022 Malabs orption: during digestion, intrinsic factor (IF) \nin the stomach binds B12, enabling it to be absorbed in the terminal ileum. Malab-\nsorption can therefore arise in the stomach due to lack of IF (pernicious anaemia, \npost gastrectomy) or the terminal ileum (ileal resection, Crohn\u2019s disease, bacterial \novergrowth, tropical sprue, tapeworms). \u2022 Congenital metabolic errors.\nFeatures General: Symptoms of anaemia (p324), \u2018lemon tinge\u2019 to skin due to \ncombination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis \n(beefy-red sore tongue; \ufb01 g 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326).\nNeuropsychiatric: Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia.\nNeurological: Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy. Also subacute combined \ndegeneration of the spinal cord, a combination of peripheral sensory neuropa-\nthy with both upper and lower motor neuron signs due to \ue001B12. The patient may \ndisplay the classical triad of: \u2022 extensor plantars (UMN) \u2022 absent knee jerks (LMN) \n\u2022 absent ankle jerks (LMN). The onset is insidious (subacute) and signs are symmet-\nrical. There is a combination of post erior (dorsal) column loss, causing the sensory \nand LMN signs, and corticospinal tract loss, causing the motor and UMN signs (p446). \nThe spinothalamic tracts are preserved so pain and temperature sensation may \nremain intact even in severe cases. Joint-position and vibration sense are often \naff ected \ufb01 rst leading to ataxia, followed by stiff ness and weakness if untreated. \n\ue007The neurological signs of B12 de\ufb01 ciency can occur without anaemia.\nPernicious anaemia (PA) This is an autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis \nleads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 there-\nfore remains unbound and conseqeuently cannot be absorbed by the terminal ileum.\nIncidence: 1:1000; \ue033:\ue032\u22481.6:1; usually >40yrs; higher incidence if blood group A.\nAssociations: Other autoimmune diseases (p553): thyroid disease (~25%), vitiligo, \nAddison\u2019s disease, hypoparathyroidism. Carcinoma of stomach is ~3-fold more \ncommon in pernicious anaemia, so have a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy.\nTests: \u2022 \ue001Hb. \u2022 \ue000MCV. \u2022 WCC and \ue001platelets if severe. \u2022 \ue001Serum B12\n4. \u2022 Reticulocytes may \nbe \ue001 as production impaired. \u2022 Hypersegmented neutrophils (p332). \u2022 Megaloblasts in \nthe marrow. \u2022 Speci\ufb01 c tests for PA: 1 Parietal cell antibodies: found in 90% with PA, \nbut also in 3\u201310% without. 2 IF antibodies: speci\ufb01 c for PA, but lower sensitivity.\nTreatment: Treat the cause if possible. If due to malabsorption, give hydroxoco-\nbalamin (B12) 1mg IM alternate days for 2wks (or, if CNS signs, until improvement \nstops), then 1mg IM every 3 months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12 \ncan be given after the initial IM course (50\u2013150mcg/daily, between meals). Im-\nprovement is indicated by a transient marked reticulocytosis (\ue000MCV), after 4\u20135 days.\nPractical hints: \u2022 Beware of diagnosing PA in those under 40yrs old: look for GI ma-\nlabsorption (small bowel biopsy, p266).\n  \n\u2022 Watch for hypokalaemia due to uptake into new haematopoietic cells.\n  \n\u2022 Transfusion is best avoided, but PA with high-output CCF may require transfusion, \nafter doing tests for FBC, folate, B12, and marrow sampling.\n  \n\u2022 As haematopoiesis accelerates on treatment, additional iron may be needed.\n  \n\u2022 Hb rises ~10g/L per week; WCC and platelet count should normalize in 1wk.\nPrognosis: Supplementation usually improves peripheral neuropathy within the \n\ufb01 rst 3\u20136 months, but has little eff ect on cord signs. Patients do best if treated as \nsoon as possible after the onset of symptoms: don\u2019t delay!\n4 Serum B12 levels are normal in many patients with subclinical B12 de\ufb01 ciency. Measuring homocysteine or \nmethylmalonic acid (\ue000 if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests.", "text_length": 4356, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 342/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 341, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.752428", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.753264", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
