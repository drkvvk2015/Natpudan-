Methadone is\nusually given q12h, sometimes q8h. Start low and go slow is the key for\nusing methadone. Pay close attention to sedation during methadone con\nversion and be prepared to reduce dose if necessary. To improve tolerability\nwith conversion, consider spreading out to a dose change every 3 days\ninstead of everyday. Due to its complex pharmacology, methadone should\nonly be prescribed by clinicians familiar with this drug\nPROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR POOR PAIN CON\nTROL\nsomatization,\nsubstance\nuse,\ncognitive\nimpairment, neuropathic pain\nSPECIFIC SITUATIONS\n\u0002\nRENAL FAILURE\nmethadone is hepatically excreted\nand not dialyzable. Thus, methadone is the drug of\nchoice for patients with renal failure and/or on\ndialysis. Other opioids for patients with renal fail\nure include fentanyl (excreted unchanged by the\nkidneys with no intermediate metabolites) and\nhydromorphone (more potent and thus fewer\ntoxic metabolites)\n\u0002\nNEUROPATHIC PAIN\nopioids are effective against\nneuropathic pain. Methadone is theoretically\nmore useful because of its NMDA antagonist activ\nity. Also consider use of non opioids such as gaba\npentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, venlafaxine,\nand TCAs\nTREATMENT ISSUES (CONT\u2019D)\nPrinciples of Pain Control\n393", "text_length": 3227, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 399/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 398, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.798336", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.799121", "status": "pending"}
