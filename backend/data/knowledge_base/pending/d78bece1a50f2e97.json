All hospi-\ntal inpatients should be assessed for DVT/PE risk and off ered prophylaxis if appropri-\nate. 65% of below-knee DVTs are asymptomatic; these rarely embolize to the lung.\nRisk factors \ue000Age, pregnancy, synthetic oestrogen, trauma, surgery (especially pel-\nvic/orthopaedic), past DVT, cancer, obesity, immobility, thrombophilia (p374).\nSigns \u2022Calf warmth/tenderness/swelling/erythema. \u2022Mild fever. \u2022Pitting oedema.\n\ue031\ue031 Cellulitis; ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Both may coexist with a DVT.\nTests \ue007Calculate Wells score (see table 13.5) before ordering D-dimer. D-dimer is sen-\nsitive but not speci\ufb01 c for DVT (also \ue000 in infection, pregnancy, malignancy, and post-op).\nWells score: \u22641 point = DVT unlikely: Perform D-dimer. If negative, DVT excluded. \nIf positive, proceed to USS (if USS negative, DVT excluded; if positive, treat as DVT).\n\u22652 points = DVT likely: Do D-dimer and USS. If both negative, DVT excluded. If USS posi-\ntive, treat as DVT. If D-dimer positive and USS negative, repeat USS in 1 week.\nDo thrombophilia tests (p374) before commencing anticoagulant therapy if there \nare no predisposing factors, in recurrent DVT, or if DVT in unusual site. Look for un-\nderlying malignancy: Urine dip; FBC, LFT, Ca\n2+; CXR \u00b1 CT abdomen/pelvis (and mam-\nmography in \ue033) if >40yrs.\nPrevention \u2022Stop the oral contraceptive pill 4wks pre-op. \u2022Mobilize early. \u2022LMWH eg \nenoxaparin 20mg/24h SC, \ue000 to 40mg for high-risk patients (p375) (caution if eGFR less \nthan 30mL/min/1.73m\n2). \u2022Graduated compression stockings (\u2018thromboembolic deter-\nrent (TED) stockings\u2019; CI: ischaemia) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices \n\ue001 risk of DVT by ~70% in surgical patients.\u2022Fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor) \ue001 risk \nof DVT over LMWH in eg major orthopaedic surgery without \ue000 risk of bleeding.\nTreatment LMWH (eg enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/24h SC) or fondaparinux. LMWH is superi-\nor to unfractionated heparin (used in renal failure or if \ue000risk of bleeding; dose guided \nby APTT, p350). Cancer patients should receive LMWH for 6 months (then review). In \nothers, start warfarin simultaneously with LMWH (warfarin is prothrombotic for the \n\ufb01 rst 48h). Stop heparin when INR is 2\u20133; treat for 3 months in most (longer in some \ncases\u2014see p351). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS p190), eg dabigatan, apixaban, \nrivoraxaban, are newer alternatives licensed for the treatment of DVT with bene\ufb01 ts \nrelating to simpler dosing and monitoring and \ue001 bleeding risk. Inferior vena caval \n\ufb01 lters may be used in active bleeding, or when anticoagulants fail, to minimize risk of \nPE. Post-phlebitic change (pain, swelling, and skin changes) can be seen in 10\u201330%\u2014\ngraduated compression stockings may help.\nIn patients with symptoms in both legs, the more symptomatic leg is used.\nTable 13.5 Wells score\nClinical features\nScore\nActive cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative)\n 1 point\nParalysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of leg\n 1 point\nRecently bedridden for >3d or majory surgery in last 12wks\n 1 point\nLocal tenderness along distribution of deep venous system\n 1 point\nEntire leg swollen\n 1 point\nCalf swelling >3cm compared with asymptomatic leg (measured \n10cm below tibial tuberosity)\n 1 point\nPitting oedema (greater in the symptomatic leg)\n 1 point\nCollateral super\ufb01 cial veins (non-varicose)\n 1 point\nPreviously documented DVT\n 1 point\nAlternative diagnosis at least as likely as DVT\n\u03a92 points\nReprinted from the Lancet, 350, Wells PS et al., 'Value of assessment of pretest probability of deep-vein \nthrombosis in clinical management', 1795\u20138, Copyright 1997, with permission from Elsevier.\nPretest clinical probability scoring for DVT: the Wells score", "text_length": 3848, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 586/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 585, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.186258", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.187076", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
