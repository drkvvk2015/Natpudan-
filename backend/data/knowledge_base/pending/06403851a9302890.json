For some, this is one of the challenges and \nthrills in medicine. There may be no one else available to help when there is an \nabsolute and urgent indication for IV drugs/\ufb02 uids/blood\u2014and all of the previously \ndiscussed measures have been tried, and have failed. Think of lonesome night \nshifts, over-run emergency departments, a disaster scene, war, or medicine in \nthe \ufb01 eld. The following measures are not recommended for non-life-threatening \nscenarios:\n \n\ue022Don\u2019t worry. Have a good look again. Feet (avoid in diabetics)? Inside of the \nforearm? Upper arm?\n \n\ue022Have you really exhausted all of your options for help from a colleague? Maybe \nthe anaesthetist or ICU registrar is approachable\u2014they do have remarkable skills.\n \n\ue022Is the patient familiar with his/her own veins (eg previous IV drug abuser)?\n \n\ue022If there is only a small amount of IV medication required and a small, short vein, \nyou may be able to gain access with a carefully placed butter\ufb02 y needle that is \ntaped down. Some drugs cannot be passed this way (eg amiodarone, K\n+).\n \n\ue022The external jugular vein may become prominent when the patient is head down \n(Trendelenburg) by 5\u201310\u00b0 (\ue007not in situations of \ufb02 uid overload, LVF, \ue000ICP). Only at-\ntempt cannulation of this vein if you are not going to jeopardize future central \nline insertion, and if you can clearly determine the surrounding anatomy.\n \n\ue022In an arrest situation, the 2015 Advanced Life Support Guidelines recommend \nthe intraosseous route in both adults and children if venous access is not pos-\nsible; access devices should be available within resuscitation settings (eg emer-\ngency department).\nOnly do the following if you have had the appropriate training/experience:\n \n\ue022In children, consider cannulating a scalp vein.\n \n\ue022Central venous catheterization (p775). This may be just as hard in a profoundly \nhypovolaemic arrest patient, and a good knowledge of local anatomy and of the \nprocedure (\u00b1 ultrasound guidance) will be invaluable.\nIf you don\u2019t have an intraosseous access device, a cut down to the long saphen-\nous vein may be attempted, in extremis, even if you have no prior experience (at \nthis site you won\u2019t kill by being ham-\ufb01 sted). \ue022Make a transverse incision 1\u20132cm \nanterior and superior to the medial malleolus. \ue022Free vein with forceps. \ue022Cannulate \nit under direct vision. \ue007Here, \u2018\ufb01 rst do no harm\u2019 is trumped by \u2018nothing ventured, \nnothing gained\u2019.\nHopefully, it shouldn\u2019t ever have to come to these measures, but one day\u2026\nA last throw of the dice\n1 Poiseuille\u2019s law is a neat piece of physiology and worth remembering\u2014it is applicable in some form to \nalmost every system in the body. Note that it is a 4th-power law: a small change in the radius makes a huge \ndiff erence to \ufb02 ow.\nTable 18.1 Intravenous cannulae sizes and UK colour conventions\nGauge Colour\nDiameter \n(mm)\nLength \n(mm)\nFlow rate \n(mL/min)\n14G\nORANGE/BROWN\n2 . 0\n45\n250\n16G\nGREY\n1 . 7\n42\n170\n18G\nGREEN\n1 . 2\n40\n90\n20G\nPINK\n1 . 0\n32\n55\n22G\nBLUE\n0 . 28\n25\n25\n24G\nYELLOW\n0 . 07\n19\n24\nFlow rate is given as maximum \ufb02 ow rate under gravity; faster rates may be achievable with rapid infusion devices.\nAccording to Poiseuille\u2019s law\n1 the \ufb02 ow rate (Q) of a \ufb02 uid through a tubular structure is inversely proportional \nto viscosity (\u03b7) and length (l ) and proportional to the pressure diff erence across it (Pi \u03a9 Po) and the radius \nto the power of 4(r \n4).
