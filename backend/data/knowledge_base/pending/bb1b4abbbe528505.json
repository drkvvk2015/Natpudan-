There are almost always \naccomplices who, if arrested now, may stop a killing from unfolding. These usual \nsuspects are: \ue007dehydration \ue007constipation \ue007covert alcohol use \ue007infection (eg spon-\ntaneous peritonitis, see earlier in topic) \ue007opiate over-use\u2014or \ue007an occult GI bleed. If \nall have alibis, think of portal vein thrombosis, and call in the Chief Inspector.\nIs cirrhosis becoming decompensated?\n \ue022Prepare to make an arrest...\nThe \ufb01 rst liver transplant was in Denver, USA, in 1963. Now 800\u20131000 are performed \neach year in the UK (indications see p284). The limiting step for the procedure is \noften the waiting-list for a donor organ, which may be cadaveric (heart-beating or \nnon-heart-beating) or from live donors (right lobe). Contraindications include ex-\ntrahepatic malignancy; severe cardiorespiratory disease; systemic sepsis; expected \nnon-compliance with drug therapy; ongoing alcohol consumption (in those with \nalcohol-related liver disease). Refer earlier rather than later, eg when ascites is \nrefractory or after a 1st episode of bacterial peritonitis. Prioritization in the UK is \nbased upon the UKELD (UK end-stage liver disease) score, calculated from serum Na\n+, \ncreatinine, bilirubin, and INR.\n29\nPost-op: 12\u201348h on ITU, with enteral feeding starting as soon as possible and close \nmonitoring of LFT. Immunosuppression examples: tacrolimus \u00b1 mycophenolate \nmofetil (or aza thioprine) + prednisolone. Hyper acute rejection is a result of ABO \nincompatibility. Acute rejection (T-cell mediated, at 5\u201310d): the patient feels unwell \nwith pyrexia and tender hepatomegaly\u2014often managed by altering the immuno-\nsuppressives. Other complications: sepsis (esp. Gram \u03a9ve and CMV), hepatic artery \nthrombosis, chronic rejection (at 6\u20139 months), disease recurrence, and, rarely, \ngraft-versus-host disease. Average patient survival at 1yr is ~80% (5yr survival \n60\u201390%; depends on the pre-op disease).\nLiver transplantation", "text_length": 3385, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 285/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 284, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.537730", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.540959", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
