They can also cause \ninfectious disease. This produces a diagnostic challenge: are the detected organisms \ncausing infection or a contaminating commensal? The answer may lie in the pres-\nence or absence of coagulase, an enzyme which coagulates plasma.\nCoagulase-negative staphylococci: eg Staphylococcus epidermidis are less viru-\nlent. Pathogenicity is likely only if there is underlying immune system dysfunction or \nforeign material (prosthetic valve/joint, IV line, PD catheter, pacemaker).\nStaphylococcus aureus is coagulase positive. Presentation:\n1   Toxin release causes disease distant from infection. Includes:\n  \n\u2022 scalded skin syndrome\u2014bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins \n(no mucosal disease, \ue001skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis)\n  \n\u2022 preformed toxin in food\u2014sudden D&V (p428)\n  \n\u2022 toxic shock\u2014fever, confusion, rash, diarrhoea, \ue001BP, AKI, multiorgan dysfunction.\nTampon associated or occurs with (minor) local infection.\n2   Local tissue destruction: impetigo, cellulitis, mastitis, septic arthritis, osteomy-\nelitis, abscess, pneumonia, UTI.\n3   Haematogenous spread: bacteraemia, endocarditis, \u2018metastatic\u2019 seeding.\nDiagnosis: positive culture from relevant site of infection. Treatment: \ue022Sepsis, see \np792. Drain infected foci, antibiotic (topical/oral/IV) based on illness severity and risk \nfactors. Consider local epidemiology of resistance. If systemic treatment indicated, \nuse \ue020-lactam whenever possible (may need to cover resistant strains until sensitiv-\nity available). Preformed toxin in food: supportive, antibiotics not usually indicated.\nStreptococci:\nClassi\ufb01 cation based on Lance\ufb01 eld group persists in terminology (\ufb01 g 9.5). Includes:\n  \n\u2022 Streptococcus pyogenes (\ue020-haemolytic group A): colonizes throat, skin, anogenital \ntract. Range of infection: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, \ncellulitis, pneumonia, peripartum sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis. All can\ue003streptococcal \ntoxic shock = sudden-onset \ue001BP, multiorgan failure. Post-infectious complications \nrare: rheumatic fever (p142), glomerulonephritis (p310). Treatment: penicillin.\n  \n\u2022 Streptococcus agalactiae (\ue020-haemolytic group B): neonatal and peurperal infec-\ntion, skin, soft tissue. Invasive disease (bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, \nseptic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: DM, malignancy, chronic dis-\nease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol.\n  \n\u2022 Streptococcus milleri: if found in blood culture look for an abscess\u2014mouth, liver, \nlung, brain. Treatment: penicillin.\n  \n\u2022 Streptococcus pneumoniae: pneumonia (pp166\u20138), otitis media, meningitis, septi-\ncaemia. Treatment: penicillin. Vaccination: childhood, hyposplenism, >65y (p407).\n  \n\u2022 Viridans streptococci: commonest cause of oral/dental origin endocarditis (p150).\n  \n\u2022 Streptococcus bovis: bacteraemia\ue003endocarditis. Look for colon/liver disease.\nStaph. aureus  which produces \ue020-lactamase, or an altered enzyme responsible \nfor cell wall formation, will be resistant to \ue020-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cepha-\nlosporins, carbapenems, see p385). Resistance is usually de\ufb01 ned by stability to \nmeticillin, ie meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin resistance also \nexists and is classi\ufb01 ed according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit \nbacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomy-\ncin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA). Resistant staphylococci cause \ue000 morbidity \nand mortality compared to sensitive strains. Risk factors for colonization include: \nantibiotic exposure, hospital stay, surgery, nursing home residence. Treatment of \ninfection (not colonization): vancomycin (for MRSA), teicoplanin. Oral agents with \nactivity against MRSA include clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, linezolid. \nPrevention: surveillance, barrier precautions, hand-hygiene, decolonization (mupi-\nrocin 2%, chlorhexidine, tea tree oil), antimicrobial stewardship.
