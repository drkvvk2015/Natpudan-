Simple laxatives (p260, but beware lactulose \nwhich ferments and can aggravate bloating). If 2 of these fail, try prucalopride, \nlinaclotide, or lubiprostone; or self-administered anal irrigation.\n  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea: avoid sorbitol sweeteners, alcohol, and caff eine; reduce dietary \n\ufb01 bre content; encourage patients to identify their own \u2018trigger\u2019 foods; try a \nbulking agent \u00b1 loperamide 2mg after each loose stool.\n  \n\u2022 Colic/bloating: oral antispasmodics: mebeverine 135mg/8h or hyoscine butyl-\nbromide 10mg/8h (over the counter). Combination probiotics in suffi  cient doses \n(eg VSL#3\u00ae) may help \ufb02 atulence or bloating. Diets low in fermentable, poorly \nabsorbed saccharides and alcohols may provide bene\ufb01 t (the low FODMAP diet).\n  \n\u2022 Psychological symptoms/visceral hypersensitivity: emphasize the positive! \nYou have excluded sinister pathology and over time, symptoms tend to improve. \nConsider cognitive behavioural therapy (OHCS p390), hypnosis, and tricyclics, eg \namitriptyline 10\u201320mg at night (SE: drowsiness, dry mouth); explain that this is at \na low dose for visceral pain (ie you are not prescribing the higher licensed dose \nfor depression).\nManaging IBS  \n20 Bacterial overgrowth proximal to the colon causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vitamin malabsorp-\ntion.
