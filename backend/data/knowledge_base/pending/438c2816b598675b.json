Proteinuria usually <1g. Slow, indolent disease: 20\u2013\n50% progress to renal failure over 30yr. Worse prognosis in \ue032, \ue000BP, \ue000creatinine, \nproteinuria. Diagnosis: Renal biopsy: IgA deposition in mesangium. Treatment: \nACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria and protect renal function. Corticosteroids and \ufb01 sh oil if \npersistent proteinuria >1g despite 3\u20136 months of ACE-i/ARB and GFR >50.\nHenoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP)\nSmall vessel vasculitis and systemic variant of IgA nephropathy with IgA deposition \nin skin/joints/gut in addition to kidney. Presentation: Purpuric rash on extensor sur-\nfaces (typically on the legs, p702), \ufb02 itting polyarthritis, abdominal pain (GI bleeding), \nand nephritis. Diagnosis: Usually clinical. Con\ufb01 rmed with positive IF for IgA and C3 in \nskin. Renal biopsy is identical to IgA nephropathy. Treatment: Renal disease is man-\naged as IgA nephropathy. Steroids may be used for gut involvement.\nPost-streptococcal GN\nOccurs after a throat (~ 2 weeks) or skin (~3\u20136 weeks) infection. Streptococcal antigen \ndeposits in the glomerulus leading to immune complex formation and in\ufb02 ammation. \nPresentation: Varies from haematuria to acute nephritis: haematuria, oedema, \ue000BP \nand oliguria. Diagnosis: Evidence of streptococcal infection: \ue000ASOT, \ue000anti-DNAse B. \nAlso \ue001C3. Treatment: Supportive, antibiotics to clear the nephritogenic bacteria.\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease\nPreviously known as Goodpasture\u2019s disease. Rare. Auto-antibodies to type IV colla-\ngen which is present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Presenta-\ntion: Renal disease (oliguria/anuria, haematuria, AKI, renal failure) and lung disease \n(pulmonary haemorrhage in 50\u201390% \ue018 SOB, haemoptysis). Dialysis-dependence at \npresentation and \ue000crescents on biopsy predict poor prognosis. Diagnosis: Anti-GBM \nin circulation/kidney (\ufb01 g 7.11). Treatment: Plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and \ncyclophosphamide.\nRapidly progressive GN\nAny aggressive GN, rapidly progressing to renal failure over days or weeks. Causes \ninclude small vessel/ANCA vasculitis (p314), lupus nephritis (p314), anti-GBM disease. \nOther GNs may \u2018transform\u2019 to become rapidly progressive including IgA, membranous. \nDiagnosis: Breaks in the GBM allow an in\ufb02 ux of in\ufb02 ammatory cells so that crescents \nare seen on renal biopsy (may be referred to as crescentic GN) (\ufb01 g 7.12). Treatment: \nCorticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Other treatments depend on aetiology eg \nplasma exchange for anti-GBM/ANCA vasculitis, possible role for monoclonal antibodies \nin lupus nephritis.\nNephritic glomerulonephritis", "text_length": 3375, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 319/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 318, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.714667", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.715551", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
