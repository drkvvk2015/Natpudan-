It is common (4/1000/yr). If treated, \nprognosis is excellent; untreated it is disastrous (eg heart disease, dementia). \ue007As \nit is insidious, both you and your patient may not realize anything is wrong, so be \nalert to subtle, non-speci\ufb01 c symptoms, esp. in women \ue00640yrs old (\ue033:\ue032\u22486:1).\nSymptoms Tiredness; sleepy, lethargic; \ue001mood; cold-disliking; \ue000weight; constip ation; \nmen orrhagia; hoarse voice; \ue001memory/cognition; dementia; myalgia; cramps; weakness.\nSigns BRADYCARDIC; re\ufb02 exes relax slowly; ataxia (cerebellar); dry thin hair/skin; \nyawn ing/drowsy/coma (p834); cold hands \u00b1 \ue001T\u00b0; ascites \u00b1 non-pitting oedema (lids; \nhands; feet) \u00b1 peri cardial or pleural eff usion; round puff y face/double chin/obese; de-\nfeated demeanour; immobile \u00b1 ileus; CCF. Also: neuropathy; myopathy; goitre (\ufb01 g 5.16).\nDiagnosis (p216) \ue007Have a low threshold for doing TFTs! \ue000TSH (eg \u22654mU/L);\n3 \ue001T4 (in rare \nsecondary hypothyroidism: \ue001T4 and \ue001TSH or \ue009 due to lack from the pituitary, p232). \nCholesterol and triglyceride\ue000; macrocytosis (less often normochromic anaemia too).\nCauses of primary autoimmune hypothyroidism\n  \n\u2022 Primary atrophic hypothyroidism: \ue033:\ue032\u22486:1. Common. Diff use lymphocytic in\ufb01 lt-\nration of the thyroid, leading to atrophy, hence no goitre.\n  \n\u2022 Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis: Goitre due to lympho cytic and plasma cell in\ufb01 ltration. \nCommoner in women aged 60\u201370yrs. May be hypothyroid or euthyroid; rarely initial \nperiod of hyper thyroid (\u2018Hashitoxicosis\u2019). Autoantibody titres are very high.\nOther causes of primary hypothyrodism\n\ue007World-wide the chief cause is iodine de\ufb01 ciency.\n  \n\u2022 Post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Drug-induced: Antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, lithium, iodine.\n  \n\u2022 Subacute thyroiditis: Temporary hypothyroidism after hyperthyroid phase.\nSecondary hypothyroidism Not enough TSH (due to hypopituitarism); very rare.\nHypothyroidism\u2019s associations Autoimmune is seen with other autoimmune dis-\neases (type 1 DM, Addison\u2019s, and PA, p334). Turner\u2019s and Down\u2019s syndromes, cystic \n\ufb01 brosis, primary biliary cholangitis, ovarian hyperstimulation (OHCS p311); POEMS syn-\ndrome\u2014poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, m-protein band (plasma-\ncytoma) + skin pigmentation/tethering. Genetic: Dyshormonogenesis: genetic (often \nautosomal recessive) defect in hormone synthesis, eg Pendred\u2019s syndrome (with deaf-\nness): there is \ue000uptake on isotope scan, which is displaced by potassium perchlorate.\nPregnancy problems Eclamp sia, anaemia, prematurity, \ue001birthweight, stillbirth, PPH.\nTreatment\n  \n\u2022 Healthy and young: Levothyroxine (T4), 0\u2013100mcg/24h PO; review at 12wks. Ad-\njust 6-weekly by clinical state and to normalize but not suppress TSH (keep TSH \n>0.5mU/L). Thyroxine\u2019s t\u00bd is ~7d, so wait ~4wks before checking TSH to see if a \ndose change is right. NB: small changes in serum free T4 have a logarithmic eff ect \non TSH. Once normal, check TSH yearly. Enzyme inducers (p689) \ue000metabolism of \nlevothyroxine.\n  \n\u2022 Elderly or ischaemic heart disease: Start with 25mcg/24h; \ue000dose by 25mcg/4wks \naccording to TSH (\ue007cautiously, as levothyroxine may precipitate angina or MI).\n  \n\u2022 If diagnosis is in question and T4 already given: Stop T4; recheck TSH in 6 weeks.\nAmiodarone An iodine-rich drug structurally like T4 ; 2% of users will get signi\ufb01 -\ncant thyroid problems from it. Hypothyroidism can be caused by toxicity from io-\ndine excess (T4 release is inhibited). Thyrotoxicosis may be caused by a destructive \nthyroiditis causing hormone release. Here, radioiodine uptake can be undetectable \nand if this is the case, glucocorticoids may help. Get expert help. Thyroidectomy \nmay be needed if amiodarone cannot be discontinued. T \u00bd of amiodarone \u224880d, so \nproblems persist after withdrawal. If on amiodarone, check TFTS 6-monthly.\n\ue007\ue007Myxoedema coma The ultimate hypothyroid state before death. See p834.\n3 \ue007Treat the patient not the blood level! No exact cut-off  in TSH can be given partly because risk of death \nfrom heart disease mirrors TSH even when in the normal range in women. Risk \u2248 1.4 if TSH 1.5\u20132.4 vs 1.7 if TSH \n2.5\u20133.5. If TSH >3.65 and possibly symptomatic, a low dose of levothyroxine may be tried. Monitor symptoms, \nTSH and T4 carefully. Over-exposure to thyroxine may cause osteoporosis \u00b1 AF.", "text_length": 4416, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 228/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 227, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.375540", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.376536", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
