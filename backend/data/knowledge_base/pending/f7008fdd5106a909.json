Patients are usually eu-\nthyroid, but may become hyperthyroid (\u2018toxic\u2019). MNG may be retro- or substernal. \nHypothyroidism and malignancy within MNG are rare. Plummer\u2019s disease is hyper-\nthyroidism with a single toxic nodule (uncommon). \u2022Fibrotic goitre: Eg Reidel\u2019s thy-\nroiditis. \u2022Solitary thyroid nodule: typically cyst, adenoma, discrete nodule in MNG \nor malignant (~10%).\nInvestigations Check TSH and USS (solid, cystic, complex or part of a group of \nlumps). If abnormal consider: \u2022T4, autoantibodies (p216, eg if Hashimoto\u2019s /Graves\u2019, \nsuspected). \u2022CXR with thoracic inlet view (tracheal goitres and metastases?). \u2022Ra-\ndionuclide scans (\ufb01 g 13.22) may show malignant lesions as hypofunctioning or \u2018cold\u2019, \nwhereas a hyperfunct ioning \u2018hot\u2019 lesion suggests adenoma. \u2022FNA (\ufb01 ne-needle aspira-\ntion) and cytology\u03a9will characterize lesion. \ue007A FNA \ufb01 nding of a follicular neoplasm \ncan be challenging (15\u201330% malignant)\u03a9discuss with cytopathologist and perform \nmolecular diagnostics where available; if any doubt, refer for surgery.\nWhat should you do if high-resolution ultrasound shows impalpable nodules? \nSuch thyroid nodules can usually be observed provided they are:\n  \n\u2022 <1cm across (which accounts for most; ultrasound can detect lumps <2mm; such \n\u2018incidentalomas\u2019 occur in 46% of routine autopsies) and are asymptomatic.\n  \n\u2022 There is no past history of thyroid cancer or neck irradiation.\n  \n\u2022 No family history of medullary cancer (if present, do USS-guided FNA).\nThyroid cancer\n1   Papillary: (60%.) Often in younger patients. Spread: lymph nodes and lung (jugulo-\ndigastric node metastasis is the so-called lateral aberrant thyroid). \ue014: total thyroid-\nectomy to remove non-obvious tumour \u00b1 node excision \u00b1 radioiodine (\n131I) to ablate \nresidual cells. Give levothyroxine to suppress TSH. Prognosis: better if young and \ue033.\n2   Follicular: (\u226425%.) Occurs in middle-age and spreads early via blood (bone, lungs). \nWell-diff erentiated. \ue014: total thyroidectomy + T4 suppression + radioiodine ablation.\n3   Medullary: (5%.) Sporadic (80%) or part of MEN syndrome (p223). May produce \ncalcitonin which can be used as a tumour marker. They do not concentrate iodine. \n\ue007Perform a phaeochromocytoma screen pre-op. \ue014: thyroidectomy + node clear-\nance. External beam radio therapy may prevent regional recurrence.\n4   Lymphoma: (5%.) \ue033:\ue032\u22483:1. May present with stridor or dysphagia. Do full stag-\ning pre-treatment (chemoradiotherapy). Assess histology for mucosa-associated \nlymphoid tissue (MALT) origin (associated with a good prognosis).\n5   Anaplastic: Rare. \ue033:\ue032\u22483:1. Elderly, poor response to any treatment. In the absence \nof unresectable disease, excision + radiotherapy may be tried.\nThyroid surgery Plays a signi\ufb01 cant role in the management of thyroid disease. \nOperations include partial lobectomy or lobectomy (for isolated nodules); and thy-\nroidectomy (for cancers, MNG, or Graves\u2019). Indications: Pressure symptoms, relapse \nhyperthyroidism after >1 failed course of drug treatment, carcinoma, cosmetic \nreasons, symptomatic patients planning pregnancy. Pre-operative management: \nRender euthyroid pre-op with antithyroid drugs (eg carbimazole up to 20mg/12h PO \nor  propylthiouracil 200mg/12h PO but stop 10d prior to surgery as these increase vas-\ncularity). Propranolol up to 80mg/8h PO can be used to control tachycardia or tremor \nassociated with hyperthyroidism (continue for 5d post-op). Check vocal cords by in-\ndirect laryngoscopy pre- and post-op (risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). Check \nserum Ca\n2+ (and PTH if abnormal).
