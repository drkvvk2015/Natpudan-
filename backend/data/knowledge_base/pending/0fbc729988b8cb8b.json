In modern-\nday use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of \ncancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which \nis expressed diff erently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at \nintervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue. Chemotherapy is \nthe only systemic treatment for cancer (surgery and radiotherapy are local treat-\nments). This is important as most cancers are considered to be systemic either due \nto metastases, or the potential to metastasize in the future. \ue007Chemotherapy should \nbe prescribed and given only under expert guidance by people trained in its use.\nIncludes:\n  \n\u2022 Single-agent: Rarely curative as genetically resistant cells are selected out.\n  \n\u2022 Combination chemotherapy: A combination of drugs with diff erent mechanisms \nof action and diff erent side-eff ect pro\ufb01 les reduces the likelihood of resistance and \ntoxicity. The drugs used should have:\n  \n\u2022 cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission\n  \n\u2022 diff erent mechanisms of action, ideally additive or synergistic eff ects\n  \n\u2022 non-overlapping toxicity to maximize bene\ufb01 t of full therapeutic doses\n  \n\u2022 diff erent mechanisms of resistance.\n  \n\u2022 Adjuvant: After other initial treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, eg following \nsurgical removal of, eg breast, bowel cancer.\n  \n\u2022 Neoadjuvant: Used to shrink tumours prior to surgical or radiological treatment. \nMay allow later treatment to be more conservative.\n  \n\u2022 Palliative: No curative aim, off ers symptom relief, may prolong survival.\nClasses of cytotoxic drugs\n  \n\u2022 Alkylating agents: Anti-proliferative drugs that bind via alkyl groups to DNA lead-\ning to apoptotic cell death, eg cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan.\n  \n\u2022 Angiogenesis inhibitors: Eg bevacizumab, a\ufb02 ibercept, sunitinib.\n  \n\u2022 Antimetabolites: Interfere with cell metabolism including DNA and protein synthe-\nsis, eg methotrexate, 5-\ufb02 uorouracil.\n  \n\u2022 Antioestrogens: Aromatoase inhibitors (eg letrozole, anastrozole), oestrogen \nreceptor antagonists (eg tamoxifen, raloxifene) used in breast cancer treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Antitumour antibiotics: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin, \nmitomycin, bleomycin.\n  \n\u2022 Monoclonal antibodies: Antibodies to a speci\ufb01 c tumour antigen can slow tumour \ngrowth by enhancing host immunity, or be conjugated with chemotherapy/radioac-\ntive isotopes to allow targeted treatment. Expect more of these in future.\n  \n\u2022 Topoisomerase inhibitors: Interrupt regulation of DNA winding, eg etoposide.\n  \n\u2022 Vinca alkaloids and taxanes: \u2018Spindle poisons\u2019 which target mechanisms of cell \ndivision, eg vincristine, vinblastine, docetaxel.\nSide-eff ects\nDue to cytotoxic eff ects on non-cancer cells. Greatest eff ect seen on dividing cells, ie \ngut, hair, bone marrow, gametes (see BOX \u2018Fertility and cancer\u2019, p525).\n  \n\u2022 Vomiting: Prophylaxis given with most cytotoxic regimens (see p251).\n  \n\u2022 Alopecia: May profoundly impact quality of life. Consider \u2018cold-cap\u2019, wig services.\n  \n\u2022 Neutropenia: Most commonly seen 7\u201314d after chemotherapy. \ue022Neutropenic sep-\nsis is life-threatening and needs urgent assessment and empirical treatment (p352).\nExtravasation8 = inadvertent in\ufb01 ltration of a drug into subcutaneous/subdermal \ntissue. Presentation: Tingling, burning, pain, redness, swelling, no \u2018\ufb02 ashback\u2019/re-\nsistance from cannula. Management: Stop and disconnect infusion. Aspirate any \nresidual drug before cannula removed. Follow local policies (ask for the \u2018extravasa-\ntion kit\u2019). Follow any drug-speci\ufb01 c recommendations. For DNA-binding drugs (an-\nthracyclines, alkylating agents, antitumour antibiotics), use a dry cold compress to \nvasoconstrict and \ue001 drug spread. For non-DNA-binding drugs (vinca alkaloids, taxa-\nnes, platin salts), use a dry warm compress to vasodilate and \ue000 drug distribution. \nExtravasation of chemotherapy", "text_length": 4147, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 532/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 531, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.091059", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.092201", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
