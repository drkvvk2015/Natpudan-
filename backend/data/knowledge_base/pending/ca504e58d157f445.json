Depending on the stage in haem biosynthesis that \nis faulty, there is accumulation of either porphyrinogens, which are unstable and \noxidize to porphyrins, or their precursors, porphobilinogen and \ue008-aminolaevulinic \nacid. Porphyrin precursors are neurotoxic, while porphyrins themselves induce pho-\ntosensitivity and the formation of toxic free radicals.\n  \n\u2022 Alcohol, lead, and iron de\ufb01 ciency cause abnormal porphyrin metabolism.\n  \n\u2022 Genetic counselling (OHCS p154) should be off ered to all patients and their families.\nAcute porphyrias Occur when the accumulation of porphyrinogen precursors pre-\ndominates, and are characterized by acute neurovisceral crises, though some forms \nhave additional photosensitive cutaneous manifestations.\nAcute intermittent porphyria: (\u2018The Madness of King George.\u2019) A low-penetrant \nautosomal dominant condition (porphobilinogen deaminase gene); 28% have no \nfamily history (de novo mutations). ~10% of those with the defective gene have \nneurovisceral symptoms. Attacks are intermittent, more common in women and \nthose aged 18\u201340, and may be precipitated by drugs. Urine porphobilinogens are \nraised during attacks (the urine may go deep red on standing) and also, in ~50%, be-\ntween attacks. Faecal porphyrin levels are normal. There is never cutaneous photo-\nsensitivity. It is the commonest form of porphyria\u2014prevalence in UK: 1\u20132/100 000.\nVariegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria: Autosomal dominant, char-\nacterized by photosensitive blistering skin lesions and/or acute attacks. The former \nis prevalent in Afrikaners in South Africa. Porphobilinogen is high only during an \nattack, and other metabolites may be detected in faeces.\nTriggers of an acute attack: Include infection, starvation (including pre-operative \n\u2018nil-by-mouth\u2019), reproductive hormones (pregnancy, premenstrual), smoking, anaes-\nthesia, and cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (alcohol, and other drugs\u2014see BOX).\nFeatures of an acute attack:\n  \n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation.\n  \n\u2022 Neuropsychiatric: peripheral neuropathy (weakness, hypotonia, pain, numbness), \nseizures (often associated with severe \ue001Na\n+), psychosis (or other odd behaviour).\n4\n  \u2022 Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, shock (due to sympathetic overactivity).\n  \n\u2022 Other: fever, \ue001Na\n+, \ue001K\n+, proteinuria, urinary porphobilinogens, discoloured urine. \nRare but serious complications include bulbar and respiratory paralysis.\n\ue022Beware the \u2018acute abdomen\u2019 in acute intermittent porphyria: colic, vomiting, fever, \nand \ue000WCC\u2014so mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Anaesthesia could be disastrous.\nTreatment of an acute attack:\n  \n\u2022 Remove precipitants (review medications; treat intercurrent illness/infection).\n  \n\u2022 IV \ufb02 uids to correct electrolyte imbalance.\n  \n\u2022 High carbohydrate intake (eg Hycal\u00ae) by NG tube, or IV if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 IV haematin is 1st-line (inhibits production of porphyrinogen precursors).\n  \n\u2022 Nausea controlled with prochlorperazine 12.5mg IM.\n  \n\u2022 Sedate if necessary with chlorpromazine 50\u2013100mg PO/IM.\n  \n\u2022 Pain control with opiate or opioid analgesia (avoid oxycodone).\n  \n\u2022 Seizures can be controlled with diazepam (although this will prolong the attack).\n  \n\u2022 Treat tachycardia and hypertension with a \ue020-blocker.\nNon-acute porphyrias\nPorphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), erythropoietic protoporphyria, and congenital \nerythro poietic porphyria are characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity alone, \nas there is no overproduction of porphyrinogen precursors, only porphyrins. PCT pre-\nsents in adults with blistering skin lesions \u00b1 facial hypertrichosis and hyperpigmen-\ntation. Total plasma porphyrins and LFTS are \ue000.
