Sporozo-\nites are transferred to a human \nhost when an infected mosquito \nbites. These travel via the blood-\nstream to the liver where matu-\nration occurs to form schizonts \ncontaining ~30 000 merozoite \noff spring. If a dormant stage \nexists (vivax, ovale, see table \n9.19), and is inadequately treat-\ned, merozoites can be released \nfrom the liver weeks, months, \nor years later causing recurrent \ndisease. The rupture of schizonts \nreleases merozoites which enter \nRBCs (\u2018what a fantastic niche!\u2019). In the RBC, merozoites form larger trophozoites and \nerthrocytic schizonts (poor prognostic indicator if seen on blood \ufb01 lm). The rupture of \nerthrocytic schizonts produces the clinical manifestations of malaria.\nClinical features\n\ue007Consider in anyone with a fever who has previously visited a malarial area (\ufb01 g 9.23), \nregardless of prophylaxis.\nPresentation: P. falciparum has a minimum incubation of 6 days and most com-\nmonly occurs within 3 months of return from an endemic area. Take a careful travel \nhistory: country, area of travel, date of return. Do not forget to ask about stopovers.\nSymptoms are non-speci\ufb01 c: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, diarrhoea, cough. Fe-\nver patterns are described but only occur if rupture of infected RBCs is synchronized: \nalternate day for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale (\u2018tertian\u2019); every 3rd day for P. \nmalariae (\u2018quartan\u2019). \ue007Most patients have no speci\ufb01 c fever pattern.\nExamination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable. If diagnosis is delayed or severe dis-\nease then may present with jaundice, confusion, seizures.\nDiagnosis\nImmediate blood testing is mandatory in UK:\n  \n\u2022 Microscopy of thick and thin blood smear. Sensitive and speci\ufb01 c in experienced \nhands.\n  \n\u2022 Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of parasite antigen. Used for initial screen if \nexpert microscopy is unavailable, eg out-of-hours. Used in addition to (not instead \nof) blood \ufb01 lm.\nResults should be available within 4h. \ue007If malaria is suspected but blood \ufb01 lm is nega-\ntive: repeat at 12\u201324h and after further 24h. Malaria is unlikely if three expert serial \nblood \ufb01 lms are negative. \ue031\ue031 dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis/encephalitis, HIV, \nviral haemorrhagic fever. Care in pregnancy: thick \ufb01 lms can be negative despite \nparasites in the placenta. Seek expert help.\nIf P. falciparum (or P. knowlesi) estimated % parasitized red cells should be given:\n  \n\u2022 >2% = \ue000 chance of severe disease (indication for parenteral treatment see pp418\u20139).\n  \n\u2022 >10% = severe disease.\nOther: FBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), creatinine and urine output (AKI), clotting \n(DIC), glucose (hypoglycaemia), ABG/lactate (acidosis), urinalysis (haemoglobinuria).\nMalaria is noti\ufb01 able to public health: www.gov.uk/health-protection-team\n1st vector\nInitial\nhuman\nhost\nNext human\nhost\nPlasmodium\nsporozoites\n2nd vector\nBlood\ninfection\nLiver\ninfection\nIn utero\ntransmission\nFig 9.27 Malaria lifecycle.\n \u2022 Failure to consider diagnosis\n \u2022 Delay in blood \ufb01 lm/RDT\n \u2022 Inadequate travel history\n \u2022 No serial blood \ufb01 lm if \ufb01 rst test negative\n \u2022 Belief prophylaxis prevents all malaria\n \u2022 Inadequate treatment (pp418\u20139)\n \u2022 Belief presents with a fever pattern\n \u2022 Inappropriate treatment (pp418\u20139)\n \u2022 Non-speci\ufb01 c symptoms not recognized\n \u2022 Failure to anticipate/treat complications.\nReproduced from Beeching et al., Returned travellers.
