Infectious mononucleosis \nin ~50% of primary infection in adults: sore throat, fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy \n(esp. posterior triangle of neck), palatal petechiae, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaun-\ndice. Malaise is prominent. Resolution of symptoms usually within 2 weeks. Chronic \nactive infection and recurrence are rare. Oncogenicity: see BOX \u2018Oncogenic viruses\u2019.\nDiagnosis:\n  \u2022 Blood \ufb01 lm: lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei) also occur \nin other viral infection (CMV, HIV, par vovirus, dengue), toxoplasmosis, typhus, leukae-\nmia, lymphoma, drug reactions, lead poisoning.\n  \u2022 Heterophile antibody tests (eg Monospot\u00ae , Paul-Bunnell) detect non-EBV heterophile \nantibodies which are present in ~85% of infectious mononucleosis sera. False posi-\ntive: pregnancy, autoimmune disease, lymphoma/leukaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Serology: IgM to EBV viral capsid antigen in acute infection. IgG if past infection.\n  \n\u2022 Reverse transcriptase viral PCR.\nTreatment: Supportive. \ue007Seek expert help if severe disease/immunosuppression: \nobservational data on the use of antivirals and steroids.\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) (human herpesvirus 5)\n50\u2013100% of adults are seropositive depending on socioeconomic and sexual risk. \nLatent infection: periodic, asymptomatic (but infectious) viral shedding in bodily \ufb02 u-\nids including blood transfusion, transplantation (CMV+ve donor to CMV\u03a9ve recipient).\nPresentation: Asymptomatic in most. Symptoms mimic infectious mononucleosis \n(see earlier in topic) or hepatitis. Severe disease in immunosuppressed (post-trans-\nplantation, HIV): oesophagitis, gastritis, colitis, retinitis (p438), pneumonitis, hepati-\ntis. Infection in pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormality.\nDiagnosis: Primary infection in immunocompetent: IgM. Immunosuppressed: quan-\ntitative nucleic acid ampli\ufb01 cation testing (QNAT) in blood greater than a de\ufb01 ned \nthreshold, or rising titre. Invasive disease: tissue QNAT, histopathology.\nTreatment: Given in severe infection/immunosuppression. Ganciclovir, valganci-\nclovir (\ue000oral bioavailability). Foscarnet and cidofovir: nephrotoxicity limit use. Pre-\nemptive treatment in transplant patients based on QNAT results. Risk/bene\ufb01 t for \nantivirals/immunoglobulin in pregnancy remains unclear. Use CMV\u03a9ve, irradiated \nblood for transfusion if immunosuppressed and at risk: transplant, HIV, leukaemia.\nOther herpes viruses\nHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV6): Roseola infantum, febrile illness without rash.\nHuman herpesvirus 8 (HHV8): Oncogenic (see BOX \u2018Oncogenic viruses\u2019), Castleman\u2019s \ndisease.\n~12% of human cancers are caused by viruses, >80% of these occur in low- and \nmiddle-income countries (table 9.12).\nCommon traits of oncoviruses:\n  \n\u2022 Virus is necessary but not suffi  cient to cause cancer.\n  \n\u2022 Cancers appear in context of chronic infection, taking years-decades to appear.\n  \n\u2022 Immune system has variable role: cancers are associated with both immunosup-\npression and chronic in\ufb02 ammation. \nTable 9.12 Oncogenic viruses\nVirus\nCancers\nEBV (HHV4)\nBurkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma in \nimmunosuppression, gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, post-\ntransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD)\nHHV8\nKaposi\u2019s sarcoma (p400) and primary eff usion lymphoma\nHPV\nCancers of: cervix, anus, vulva, penis, head, neck, oropharynx (p406)\nHepatitis B and C Hepatocellular carcinoma (p278)\nHTLV-1\nHuman T-lymphotropic virus\ue003adult T-cell leukaemia\nMCV\nMerkel cell polyomavirus\ue003Merkel cell carcinoma\nOncogenic viruses", "text_length": 3822, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 413/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 412, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.882023", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.883041", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
