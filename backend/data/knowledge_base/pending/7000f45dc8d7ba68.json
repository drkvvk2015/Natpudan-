It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by \n2\u20133 fold. Epidemiology Prevalence is ~1% (\ue000 in smokers). \ue033:\ue032 >2:1. Peak onset: 5th\u2013\n6th decade. HLA DR4/DR1 linked (associated with \ue000severity).\nPresentation Typically: Symmetrical swollen, painful, and stiff  small joints of hands \nand feet, worse in the morning. This can \ufb02 uctuate and larger joints may become in-\nvolved. Less common presentations: \u2022Sudden onset, widespread arthritis. \u2022Recur-\nring mono/polyarthritis of various joints (palindromic RA).\n2 \u2022Persistent monoarthritis \n(knee, shoulder, or hip). \u2022Systemic illness with extra-articular symptoms, eg fa tigue, \nfever, weight loss, pericarditis, and pleurisy, but initially few joint problems (com-\nmoner in \ue032). \u2022Polymyalgic onset\u2014vague limb girdle aches. \u2022Recurrent soft tissue \nproblems (eg frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis).\nSigns Early: (In\ufb02 ammation, no joint damage.) Swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints \n(often symmetrical). Look for tenosynovitis or bursitis. Later: (Joint damage, de-\nformity.) Ulnar deviation and subluxation of the wrist and \ufb01 ngers. Boutonni\u00e8re and \nswan-neck deformities of \ufb01 ngers (\ufb01 g 12.2 on p540) or Z-deformity of thumbs occur. \nHand extensor tendons may rupture. Foot changes are similar. Larger joints can be \ninvolved. Atlanto-axial joint subluxation may threaten the spinal cord (rare).\nExtra-articular manifestations Aff ect ~40% of \nRA patients. Nodules:\nElbows, lungs, cardiac, CNS, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis. Lungs: Pleural dis-\nease, interstitial \ufb01 brosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia. Car-\ndiac: IHD, pericarditis, pericardial eff usion; carpal tunnel syndrome; peripheral \nneuropathy; splenomegaly (seen in 5%; only 1% have Felty\u2019s syndrome: RA + sple-\nnomegaly + neutropenia, see p698). Eye: Episcleritis, scleritis, scleromalacia, \nkeratoconjunctivitis sicca (p560); osteoporosis; amyloidosis is rare (p370).17,18\nInvestigations Rheumatoid factor (RhF) is positive in ~70% (p553). High titres \nassociated with severe disease, erosions, and extra-articular disease. Anticyclic \ncitrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are highly speci\ufb01 c (~98%) for RA with \na reasonable sensitivity (70\u201380%); they may also predict disease progression.19 \nAnaemia of chronic disease, \ue000platelets, \ue000ESR, \ue000CRP. X-rays show soft tissue swell-\ning, juxta-articular osteopenia and \ue001joint space. Later there may be bony erosions, \nsubluxation, or complete carpal destruction (see \ufb01 g 12.5 on p541). Ultrasound and \nMRI can identify synovitis more accurately, and have greater sensitivity in detecting \nbone erosions than conventional X-rays.20\nDiagnostic criteria See table 12.4.\nManagement \ue007Refer early to a rheumatologist (before irreversible destruction).\n  \n\u2022 Disease activity is measured using the DAS28.\n3 Treatment should be escalated until \nsatisfactory control is achieved: \u2018treat to target\u2019.\n  \n\u2022 Early use of DMARDS and biological agents improves long-term outcomes (see BOX \n\u2018In\ufb02 uencing biological events in RA\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 Steroids rapidly reduce symptoms and in\ufb02 ammation. Avoid starting unless appro-\npriately experienced. Useful for acute exacerbations, eg IM depot methylpredniso-\nlone 80\u2013120mg. Intra-articular steroids have a rapid but short-term eff ect (OHCS \npp706\u20139). Oral steroids (eg prednisolone 7.5mg/d) may control diffi  cult symptoms, \nbut side eff ects preclude routine long-term use.\n  \n\u2022 NSAIDS (see p545) are good for symptom relief, but have no eff ect on disease pro-\ngression. Paracetamol and weak opiates are rarely eff ective.\n  \n\u2022 Off er specialist physio- and occupational therapy, eg for aids and splints.\n  \u2022 Surgery may relieve pain, improve function, and prevent deformity.\n  \n\u2022 There is \ue000risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, as atherosclerosis \nis accelerated in RA.21 Manage risk factors (p93). Smoking also \ue000 symptoms of RA.\n2 In rheumatological palindromes, arthritis lasting hours or days runs to and fro, visiting and revisiting \nthree or more sites, typically knees, wrists, and MCP joints. It may presage RA, SLE, Whipple\u2019s, or Beh\u00e7et\u2019s \ndisease. Remissions are (initially) complete, leaving no radiological mark.\n3 28-joint Disease Activity Score\u2014assesses tenderness and swelling at 28 joints (MCPS, PIPS, wrists, \nelbows, shoulders, knees), ESR/CRP, and patient\u2019s self-reported symptom severity.", "text_length": 4592, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 554/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 553, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.129423", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.130191", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
