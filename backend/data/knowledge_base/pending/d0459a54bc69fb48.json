Thrombosis more likely in known \u2018vasculopaths\u2019; emboli are \nsudden, eg in those without previous vessel disease; they can aff ect multiple sites, \nand there may be a bruit. Mortality: 22%. Amputation rate: 16%.\n  \n\u2022 Symptoms and signs: The 6 \u2018P\u2019S of acute ischaemia: pale, pulseless, painful, \nparalysed, paraesthetic, and \u2018perishingly cold\u2019. Onset of \ufb01 xed mottling implies \nirreversibility. Emboli commonly arise from the heart (AF; mural thrombus) or \naneurysms. \ue007In patients with known PAD, sudden deterioration of symptoms \nwith deep duskiness of the limb may indicate acute arterial occlusion. This ap-\npearance is due to extensive pre\u2013existing collaterals and must not be misdiag-\nnosed as gout/cellulitis.\n  \n\u2022 Management: \ue007This is an emergency and may require urgent open surgery or \nangioplasty. If diagnosis is in doubt, do urgent arteriography. If the occlusion \nis embolic, the options are surgical embolectomy (Fogarty catheter) or local \nthrombolysis, eg tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, p345), balancing the risks of \nsurgery with the haemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis.\n  \n\u2022 Anticoagulate with heparin after either procedure and look for the source of \nemboli. \ue007Be aware of possible post-op reperfusion injury and subsequent com-\npartment syndrome.\nAcute limb ischaemia\nFig 13.53 Leg arteries.\n(a)\n(b)", "text_length": 1908, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 665/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 664, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.314560", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.315134", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
