Look for free air under right diaphragm on\nCXR view or R lateral decubitus view. On supine abd\nview, look for outline of bowel wall (normally can\nonly see inside of lumen. If also see outside of bowel\nwall, suggests free air outside bowel)\n\u0002\nSMALL BOWEL\nmore central location, valvulae clo\nser together, thin and cross completely. Dilated if\n>3 cm [1.2 in.]\n\u0002\nLARGE BOWEL\nmore peripheral location, colonic\nhaustra wider apart, thick, and cross part way.\nNormally some air fluid levels in ascending\ncolon. Dilated if >5 cm [2 in.]. Thumb printing\n(mural edema) and dilated bowel suggest toxic\nmegacolon. Check for air in bowel wall (pneuma\ntosis intestinalis)\n\u0002\nSTOOL IN BOWEL\ncannot distinguish from abscess\n\u0002\nKIDNEYS\nureter runs along transverse processes.\nMay see calculi along tract. If see kidney outline,\nsuggests pneumoretroperitoneum\n\u0002\nPSOAS\nair around psoas suggests perforated ret\nroperitoneal structures (rectum, duodenum). Lack\nof psoas outline suggests retroperitoneal inflam\nmation (decreased fat)\n\u0002\nBILIARY\nSTRUCTURES\ncommon bile duct up to\n6 mm in size. Check for air in portal vein or com\nmon bile duct (bowel infarction)\n\u0002\nOTHER STRUCTURES\nliver, spleen, bones\nMANAGEMENT\nACUTE\nABC, O2, IV hydration. NPO, NG if severe\nN&V/obstruction. Morphine 2.5 5 mg SC q4h PRN\nand 1 2 mg IV q1h PRN. Dimenhydrinate 50 mg\nIM/IV q6h PRN\nTREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE\nearly surgical con\nsult. Antibiotics if fever or suspect peritonitis (cefa\nzolin 1 g IV q8h, gentamicin 6 mg/kg IV q24h, metro\nnidazole 500 mg IV q12h)\nSPECIFIC ENTITIES\nGALLSTONE DISEASE SPECTRUM\nasymptomatic\n(70%), biliary colic (20%, intermittent obstruction),\nacute cholecystitis (cystic duct obstruction), choledo\ncholithiasis (common bile duct obstruction), ascend\ning cholangitis (stasis and infection of biliary tract.\nMay be secondary to choledocholithiasis. See p. 139\nfor more details), gallstone pancreatitis (pancreatic\nduct obstruction), gallstone ileus, gallbladder cancer\nACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS\n\u0002\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nabnormalities\nof\nbile\nacid\nsecretion, mucus generation, and gallbladder\nmotility ! gallstone formation ! migrate to\nobstruct the cystic duct and even common bile\nduct/pancreatic duct ! gallbladder inflammation\nSPECIFIC ENTITIES (CONT\u2019D)\nand sometimes secondary infection ! gallblad\nder necrosis and gangrene with perforation in\nsevere cases. Risk factors include older age, obe\nsity, fertility, women (i.e. forty fat fertile female),\nethnicity (Aboriginal, Hispanic), TPN, and rapid\nweight loss\n\u0002\nDIAGNOSIS\nU/S abd, endoscopic U/S, ERCP, percu\ntaneous transhepatic\ncholangiography,\nMRCP,\nHIDA/DISIDA, CT scan\n\u0002\nTREATMENTS\nsupportive measures include NPO,\nIV fluids, pain control (NSAIDs, opioids), antie\nmetics and antibiotics (cefuroxime 250 500 mg IV\nBID, or ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h plus metroni\ndazole 500 mg IV q12h). Cholecystectomy (laparo\nscopic, open) or percutaneous cholecystomy to\nfacilitate drainage. If biliary pain despite cholecys\ntectomy, consider possibility of a retained common\nbile duct stone, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or\nfunctional pain\nNEJM 2008 358:26\nACUTE MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA\n\u0002\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nembolism in the celiac or\nsuperior mesenteric artery from valvular heart dis\nease or atrial fibrillation ! sudden and severe\nperiumbilical pain out of proportion with physical\nfindings, N&V, leukocytosis, \" lactate, ileus\n\u0002\nDIAGNOSIS\nhigh clinical suspicion\n\u0002\nTREATMENTS\nimmediate surgery\nRATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION SERIES:\nDOES THIS PATIENT HAVE ACUTE\nCHOLECYSTITIS?\nHISTORY\nRUQ pain, N&V, anorexia, fever\nPHYSICAL\nMurphy sign (arrest of inspiration\nwhile palpating the gallbladder during a deep\nbreath), guarding, rigidity, RUQ mass, rebound,\nrectal tenderness\nSens\nSpc\nLR+\nLR\nMurphy sign\n65%\n87%\n2.8\n0.5\nRUQ tenderness\n77%\n54%\n1.6\n0.4\nINVESTIGATIONS\nleukocytosis, ALP >120 U/L,\nelevated ALT or AST, elevated bilirubin\nAPPROACH\n\u2018\u2018no single clinical finding or labora\ntory test carries sufficient weight to establish or\nexclude cholecystitis without further testing (i.e.\nultrasound). Clinical gestalt (without ultrasound) is\nestimated to have LR+ 25 30, bringing the prob\nability of cholecystitis from 5% pretest to 60% post\ntest.
