The patient may not tell the truth about what \nhas been taken. If there are any tablets with the patient, use MIMS Colour Index, \nEMIMS images, BNF descriptions, or the computerized system \u2018TICTAC\u2019 (ask pharmacy) \nto identify tablets and plan speci\ufb01 c treatment.\nTOXBASE The best resource for managing acute poisoning: www.toxbase.org\u2014check \nwith your Emergency Department about log-in details for your hospital.\nClues May become apparent from examination:\n  \n\u2022 Fast or irregular pulse: Salbutamol, antimuscarinics, tricyclics, quinine, or phe-\nnothiazine poisoning.\n  \n\u2022 Respiratory depression: Opiate (p842) or benzodiazepine (p842) toxicity.\n  \n\u2022 Hypothermia: Phenothiazines (p843), barbiturates.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperthermia: Amphetamines, MAOIS, cocaine, or ecstasy (p843).\n  \n\u2022 Coma: Benzodiazepines, alcohol, opiates, tricyclics, or barbiturates.\n  \n\u2022 Seizures: Recreational drugs, hypoglycaemic agents, tricyclics, phenothia zines, or \ntheophyllines.\n  \n\u2022 Constricted pupils: Opiates (p842) or insecticides (organophosphates, p843).\n  \n\u2022 Dilated pupils: Amphetamines, cocaine, quinine, or tricyclics.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperglycaemia: Organophosphates, theophyllines, or MAOIS.\n  \n\u2022 Hypoglycaemia: (p834) Insulin, oral hypoglycaemics, alcohol, or salicylates.\n  \n\u2022 Renal impairment: Salicylate (p844), paracetamol (p844), or ethylene glycol.\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic acidosis: Alcohol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paracetamol, or carbon \nmonoxide poisoning (p842).\n  \n\u2022 \ue000Osmolality: Alcohols (ethyl or methyl); ethylene glycol. See p668.\nManagement \ue007See \ufb01 g 19.25.\n  \n\u2022 Take blood as appropriate (p840). Always check paracetamol and salicylate levels.\n  \n\u2022 Empty stomach if appropriate (p840).\n  \n\u2022 Consider speci\ufb01 c antidote (p842) or oral activated charcoal (p840).\n  \n\u2022 If you are not familiar with the poison get more information. Toxbase (www.\ntoxbase.org) should be your \ufb01 rst thought. If no information here or in doubt how \nbest to act, phone the Poisons Information Service: in the UK phone 0844 892 0111.\nContinuing care Measure temperature, pulse, BP, and blood glucose regularly. Keep \non cardiac monitor. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone, turn regularly. Catherize if the \nbladder is distended, or acute kidney injury (p298) is suspected, or forced diuresis \nundertaken. Consider ICU, eg if \ue001respiration.\nPsychiatric assessment Be sympathetic despite the hour! Interview relatives and \nfriends if possible. Aim to establish:\n  \n\u2022 Intentions at time. Was this a suicide attempt, if so was the act planned? What \nprecautions against being found? Did the patient seek help afterwards? Does the \npatient think the method was dangerous? Was there a \ufb01 nal act (eg suicide note)?\n  \n\u2022 Present intentions. Do they still feel suicidal? Do they wish it had worked?\n  \n\u2022 What problems led to the act: do they still exist?\n  \n\u2022 Is there a psychiatric disorder (depression, alcoholism, personality disorder, \nschizophrenia, dementia)?\n  \n\u2022 What are the patient\u2019s resources (friends, family, work, personality)?\nThe assessment of suicide risk: The following \ue000 chance of future suicide: original in-\ntention was to die; present intention is to die; presence of psychiatric disorder; poor \nresources; previous suicide attempts; socially isolated; unemployed; male; >50yrs old. \nSee OHCS p358. There is \ue000risk of death in the \ufb01 rst year following initial presentation.\nReferral to psychiatrist: This depends partly on local resources. Refer all with pres-\nence of psychiatric disorder or high suicide risk. Consider discussing all presenta-\ntions with deliberate self-poisoning.\nMental Capacity Act or the Mental Health Act: (In England and Wales) may pro-\nvide for the detention of the patient against his or her will: see OHCS p406.", "text_length": 3855, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 846/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 845, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.644696", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.645436", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
