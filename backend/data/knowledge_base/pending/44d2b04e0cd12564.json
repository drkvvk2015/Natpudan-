These cells retain the ability to diff erentiate into RBCS, WBCS, or platelets, causing \nan excess of one or more of these cell types (table 8.10).\nTable 8.10 Classi\ufb01 cation of myeloproliferative disorders\nBy proliferating cell type\nRBC\n\ue003\nPolycythaemia vera (PRV)\nWBC\n\ue003\nChronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, p358)\nPlatelets\n\ue003\nEssential thrombocythaemia\nFibroblasts\n\ue003\nMyelo\ufb01 brosis\nPolycythaemia Relative polycythaemia (\ue001plasma volume, normal RBC mass) \nmay be acute (due to dehydration) or chronic (associated with obesity, HTN, and \na high alcohol and tobacco intake). Absolute polycythaemia (\ue000RBC mass) is classi-\ncally measured by dilution of infused autologous radioactive chromium (\n51Cr) lab-\nelled RBCs. Causes are primary (polycythaemia vera) or secondary due to hypoxia \n(eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy \nsmoking) or inappropriately \ue000erythropoietin secretion (eg in renal carcinoma, \nhepatocellular carcinoma).\nPolycythaemia vera The malignant proliferation of a clone derived from one \npluripotent stem cell. A mutation in JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) is present in >95%. The \nerythroid progenitor off spring are unusual in not needing erythropoietin to avoid \napoptosis. There is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, leading to hy-\nperviscosity and thrombosis. Commoner if >60yrs old.\nPresentation: May be asymptomatic and detected on FBC, or present with vague \nsymptoms due to hyperviscosity (p372): headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, visual dis-\nturbance. Itching after a hot bath, and erythromelalgia, a burning sensation in \ufb01 n-\ngers and toes, are characteristic. Signs: facial plethora and splenomegaly (in 60%). \nGout may occur due to \ue000urate from RBC turnover. Features of arterial (cardiac, cer-\nebral, per ipheral) or venous (DVT, cerebral, hepatic) thrombosis may be present.\nInvestigations: \u2022 FBC: \ue000RCC, \ue000Hb, \ue000HCT, \ue000PCV, often also \ue000WBC and \ue000platelets. \u2022 \ue000B12. \n\u2022 Marrow shows hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia. \u2022 Cytogenetics as re-\nquired to diff erentiate from CML. \u2022 \ue001Serum erythropoietin. \u2022 Raised red cell mass on \n51Cr studies and splenomegaly, in the setting of a normal PaO2, is diagnostic.\nTreatment: Aim to keep HCT <0.45 to \ue001risk of thrombosis. In younger patients at \nlow risk, this is done by venesection. If higher risk (age >60yrs, previous thrombo-\nsis), hydroxycarbamide (=hydroxyurea) is used. \ue025-interferon is preferred in women \nof childbearing age. Aspirin 75mg daily is also given.\nPrognosis: Variable, many remain well for years. Thrombosis and haemorrhage (due \nto defective platelets) are the main complications. Transition to myelo\ufb01 brosis occurs \nin ~30% or acute leukaemia in ~5%. Monitor FBC every 3 months.\nEssential thrombocythaemia (\ufb01 g 8.67) A clonal proliferation of megakaryo-\ncytes leads to persistently \ue000platelets, often >1000 \u2248 10\n9/L, with abnormal function, \ncausing bleeding or arterial and venous thrombosis, and microvascular occlu-\nsion\u2014headache, atypical chest pain, light-headedness, erythromelalgia. Exclude \nother causes of thrombocytosis (see BOX). Treatment: aspirin 75mg OD. Hydroxy-\ncarbamide in high-risk patients.\nMyelo\ufb01 brosis There is hyperplasia of megakaryocytes which produce platelet-\nderived growth factor, leading to intense marrow \ufb01 brosis and haematopoiesis in \nthe spleen and liver\ue003massive hepatosplenomegaly. Presentation: Hypermetabolic \nsymptoms: night sweats, fever, weight loss; abdominal discomfort due to spleno-\nmegaly; bone marrow failure (\ue001Hb, infections, bleeding). Film: Leuko erythroblastic \ncells (nucleated red cells, p328); characteristic teardrop RBCS (see \ufb01 g 8.68). \ue001Hb. Bone \nmarrow trephine for diagnosis (\ufb01 g 8.69). Treatment: Marrow support (see p364). \nAllogeneic stem cell transplant may be curative in young people but carries a high \nrisk of mortality.
