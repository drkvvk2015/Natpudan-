Most patients \nare elderly and do not complain of, or feel, cold\u2014so they have not tried to warm up. \nIn the young, hypothermia is usually from cold exposure (eg near-drowning), or is \nsecondary to impaired consciousness (eg following excess alcohol or drug overdose).\nDe\ufb01 nition Hypothermia implies a core (rectal) temperature <35\u00b0C.\nCauses In the elderly, hypothermia is often caused by a combination of factors:\n  \n\u2022 Impaired homeostatic mechanisms: usually age-related.\n  \n\u2022 Low room temperature: poverty, poor housing.\n  \n\u2022 Impaired thermoregulation: pneumonia, MI, heart failure.\n  \n\u2022 Reduced metabolism: immobility, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus.\n  \n\u2022 Autonomic neuropathy (p505); eg diabetes mellitus, Parkinson\u2019s.\n  \u2022 Excess heat loss: psoriasis and any other widespread dermatological diseases (ie TEN/\nerythrodermic eczema).\n  \n\u2022 \ue001Cold awareness: dementia, confusion.\n  \n\u2022 Increased exposure to cold: falls, especially at night when cold.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs: major tranquillizers, antidepressants, diuretics, alcohol.\nThe patient\n  \n\u2022 If the patient is shivering then the hypothermia is mild, if they are not shivering \ndespite temp <35\u00b0C then the hypothermia is severe.\n  \n\u2022 Symptoms and signs include confusion, agitation, \ue001GCS, coma, bradycardia, hypo-\ntension and arrhythmias (AF, VT, VF), especially if temp <30\u00b0C.\nThere are many stories of people \u2018returning to life\u2019 when warmed despite absence of vital \nsigns, see BOX. It is essential to rewarm (see \u2018Treatment\u2019 later in topic) and re-examine.\nDiagnosis Check oral or axillary T\u00b0. If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5\u00b0C, use a \nlow-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35\u00b0C? Infra-red ear thermometers \ncan accurately re\ufb02 ect core temperature.\nTests Urgent U&E, plasma glucose, and amylase. Thyroid function tests; FBC; blood \ncultures. Consider blood gases. The ECG may show J-waves (\ufb01 g 19.28).\nTreatment Use ABCDE approach (p779)\u2014but don\u2019t expose to cold.\n  \n\u2022 All patients should receive warm, humidi\ufb01 ed O2; ventilate if comatose or respira-\ntory insuffi  ciency.\n  \n\u2022 Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of \u00bd\u00b0C/h (check temperature, \nBP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min) using blankets or active external warm-\ning (hot air duvets). If T\u00b0 rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid \nrewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. A falling BP can be a sign of \ntoo rapid warming.\n  \n\u2022 Warm IVI.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac monitor is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming \nor on stimulation).\n  \n\u2022 Consider antibiotics for the prevention of pneumonia (p166). Give these routinely in \npatients over 65yrs with T\u00b0 <32\u00b0C.\n  \n\u2022 Consider urinary catheter (to monitor renal function).\nNB: in sudden hypothermia from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovas-\ncular instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. Options \ninclude warmed \ufb02 uid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal) \nand intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). In the event of car-\ndiac arrest, de\ufb01 brillation is usually unsuccessful if T\u00b0 <30\u00b0C (consider amiodarone, \nbretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T\u00b0 >33\u00b0C (OHCS p786).\nComplications Arrhythmias (if there is a cardiac arrest continue resuscitating until \nT\u00b0 >33\u00b0C, as cold brains are less damaged by hypoxia); pneumonia; pancreatitis; AKI; \nDIC. Prognosis: Depends on age and degree of hypothermia. If age >70yrs and T\u00b0 \n<32\u00b0C then mortality >50%.\nBefore hospital discharge Anticipate problems. Will it happen again? What is \ntheir network of support? Review medication (could you stop tranquillizers)? How is \nprogress to be monitored?
