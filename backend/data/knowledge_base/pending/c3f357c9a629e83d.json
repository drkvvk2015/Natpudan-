A test with LR+ >10 is particularly useful\n\u0003 LR+ <1.0 decreases the probability the disorder is\npresent. A test with LR+ <0.1 is particularly useful\nPOSITIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO (LR+)\n= (positive test in disease)/(positive test in no\ndisease)\n= sensitivity/(1\nspecificity)\nNEGATIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO (LR )\n= (negative test in disease)/(negative test in no\ndisease)\n= (1\nsensitivity)/specificity\nACCURACY\n\u00bc \u00f0a \u00fe d\u00de=\u00f0a \u00fe b \u00fe c \u00fe d\u00de\n= how often is test correct in predicting true\npositive and false negative\nTO CALCULATE THE POST TEST PROBABILITY OF\nA DIAGNOSIS AFTER A TEST\n\u0003\nPRE-TEST PROBABILITY\n= probability of disease just prior to performing\ntest of interest\n= disease prevalence (if no other diagnostic test\npreviously performed) or post test probability\n(after other initial investigations)\n\u0003\nPRE-TEST ODDS = pre test probability/(1\npre test\nprobability)\n\u0003\nPOST-TEST ODDS = pre test odds \u0002 likelihood ratio\n\u0003\nPOST TEST PROBABILITY = (post test odds)/(1 + post\ntest odds)\nFAGAN NOMOGRAM\neasily converts from pre test\nprobability to post test probability using LR (alleviat\ning tedious calculations above)\nD.
