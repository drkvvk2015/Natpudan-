Lamotrigine seems to have reasonable\ndata in pregnancy. Folic acid 0.4 mg PO daily should\nbe prescribed to all women on antiepileptics in the\nchildbearing age. Those planning a pregnancy should\ntake folic acid 5 mg PO daily in the preconception period\nand in first trimester, then 1 mg PO daily throughout\nremainder of pregnancy. Vitamin K may be recom\nmended during the last month of pregnancy to reduce\nthe risk of hemorrhagic complications in newborns\nLUPUS IN PREGNANCY\nLUPUS\nEXACERBATIONS\nmay\nhave\nincreased\nflares during pregnancy and postpartum if not in\nremission for >6 months prior to conception.

Patients with nephritis may have\nsevere exacerbations with acute renal failure, pree\nclampsia, and maternal death. Children of patients\nwith anti SSA and anti SSB are at increased risk for\ncongenital heart block and neonatal lupus. Patients\nwith antiphospholipid antibodies are at increased risk\nof preeclampsia, miscarriage, and possibly thrombosis\nBREAST CANCER IN PREGNANCY\nDIAGNOSIS\nstaging workup similar to non preg\nnant women.

If adjuvant radiation indicated,\nit should be deferred until after delivery. Anthracycline\ncontaining adjuvant chemotherapy can usually be\nsafely given during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, but not in\n1st trimester or within 2 weeks of delivery. Methotrex\nate is absolutely contraindicated and taxane/dose\ndense regimens should be avoided. Hormonal therapy\nis contraindicated during pregnancy.
