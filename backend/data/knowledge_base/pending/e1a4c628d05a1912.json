Diverticulosis means that diverticula are present, and diver-\nticular disease implies they are symptomatic. Diverticulitis refers to in\ufb02 ammation \nof a diverticulum. Diverticula can be aquired or congenital and may occur elsewhere, \nbut the most important are acquired colonic diverticula, to which this page refers.\nPathology Most within sigmoid colon with 95% of complications at this site, but \nright-sided and massive single diverticula can occur. High intraluminal pressures \n(due, perhaps, to lack of dietary \ufb01 bre) force the mucosa to herniate through the \nmuscle layers of the gut at weak points adjacent to penetrating vessels. 30% of \nWesterners have diverticulosis by age 60. The majority are asymptomatic.\nDiagnosis Diverticula are a common incidental \ufb01 nding at colonoscopy (\ufb01 g 6.11, p249). \nCT abdomen is best to con\ufb01 rm acute diverticulitis and can identify extent of disease \nand any complications (eg colovesical \ufb01 stulae). Colonoscopy risk perforation in acute \nsetting. AXR may identify obstruction or free air (perforation).\nDiverticular disease Altered bowel habit \u00b1 left-sided colic relieved by defecation; \nnausea and \ufb02 atulence. High-\ufb01 bre diets do not help symptoms; try antispasmodics, \neg mebeverine 135mg/8h PO. Surgical resection occasionally resorted to.\nDiverticulitis features above + pyrexia, \ue000WCC, \ue000CRP/ESR, a tender colon \u00b1 localized or \ngeneralized peritonism. Mild attacks can be treated at home with bowel rest (\ufb02 uids \nonly) \u00b1 antibiotics. If \ufb02 uids and pain not tolerated, admit for analgesia, NBM, IV \ufb02 uids \nand IV antibiotics. Most attacks settle but complications include abscess formation \n(neces sitating percutaneous CT-guided drainage), or perforation. \ue007Beware diverticu-\nlitis in immunocompromised patients (eg on steroids) who often have few symptoms \nand may present late.\nSurgery The need for surgery is re\ufb02 ected by the degree of infective complications:\nStage 1\nPericolic or mesenteric abscess\nSurgery rarely needed\nStage 2\nWalled off  or pelvic abscess\nMay resolve without surgery\nStage 3\nGeneralized purulent peritonitis\nSurgery required\nStage 4\nGeneralized faecal peritonitis\nSurgery required\nIndications for elective surgery include stenosis, \ufb01 stulae, or recurrent bleeding.\nComplications \ue007\ue007Perforation: There is ileus, peritonitis \u00b1 shock. Mortality: 40%. \nManage as for an acute abdomen. At laparotomy a Hartmann\u2019s procedure may be \nperformed (p582). Primary anastomosis is possible in selected patients. Emergency \nlaparoscopic management is an emerging alternative. \n  \n\u2022 Haemorrhage is usually sudden and painless. It is a common cause of big rectal \nbleeds (p629). Embolization (at angiography) or colonic resection only necessary \nif ongoing massive bleeding and colonoscopic haemostasis has been unsuccessful.\n  \n\u2022 Fistulae: Enterocolic, colovaginal, or colovesical (pneumaturia \u00b1 intractable UTIS). \nTreatment is surgical, eg colonic resection.\n  \n\u2022 Abscesses, eg with swinging fever, leucocytosis, and localizing signs, eg boggy \nrectal mass (pelvic abscess\u2014drain rectally). If no localizing signs, remember the \naphorism: pus somewhere, pus nowhere = pus under the diaphragm. A sub-\nphrenic abscess is a horrible way to die, so do an urgent ultrasound. Antibiotics \u00b1 \nultrasound/CT-guided drainage may be needed.\n  \n\u2022 Post-infective strictures may form in the sigmoid colon.", "text_length": 3552, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 636/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 635, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.272268", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.273014", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
