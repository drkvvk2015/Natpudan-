Normal daily \nlosses are through urine (1500mL), stool (200mL), and insensible losses (800mL). This \nrequirement is normally met through food (1000mL) and drink (1500mL).\nIntravenous \ufb02 uids Given if suffi  cient \ufb02 uids cannot be given orally. About 2\u20132.5L of \n\ufb02 uid containing roughly 70mmol Na\n+ and 70mmol K\n+ per 24h are required.1 Thus, a \ngood regimen is 2\u20132.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20\u201330mmol of K\n+ \nper litre of \ufb02 uid. Alternative routes are via a central venous line or subcutaneously. \nHowever, remember that all cannulae carry a risk of MRSA infection: femoral > jugular \n> subclavian > peripheral, so always resume oral \ufb02 uid intake as soon as possible.\n\ue007In a sick patient, don\u2019t forget to include additional sources of \ufb02 uid loss when calcu-\nlating daily \ufb02 uid requirements, such as drains, fevers, or diarrhoea (see BOX 'Special \ncases'). Daily weighing helps to monitor overall \ufb02 uid balance, as will \ufb02 uid balance \ncharts.\n\ue007Examine patients regularly to assess \ufb02 uid balance (see BOX 'Assessing \ufb02 uid bal-\nance').\nFluid compartments and types of IV \ufb02 uid\nFor a 70kg man, total bodily \ufb02 uid is ~42L (60% body weight). Of this, \u2154 is intracellular \n(28L) and \u2153 is extracellular (14L). Of the extracellular compartment, \u2153 is intravascu-\nlar, ie blood (5L). Diff erent types of IV \ufb02 uid will equilibrate with the diff erent \ufb02 uid \ncompartments depending on the osmotic content of the given \ufb02 uid.\n5% glucose: (=Dextrose.) Isotonic, but contains only a small amount of glucose \n(50g/L) and so provides little energy (~10% daily energy per litre). The liver rapidly \nmetabolizes all the glucose leaving only water, which rapidly equilibrates throughout \nall \ufb02 uid compartments. It is, therefore, useless for \ufb02 uid resuscitation (only 1/9 will \nremain in the intravascular space), but suitable for maintaining hydration. Excess 5% \nglucose IV may lead to water overload and hyponatraemia (p672).\n0.9% saline: (\u2018Normal saline.\u2019) Has about the same Na\n+ content as plasma (150mmol/L) \nand is isotonic with plasma. 0.9% saline will equilibrate rapidly throughout the extra-\ncellular compartment only, and takes longer to reach the intracellular compartment \nthan 5% glucose. It is, therefore, appropriate for \ufb02 uid resuscitation, as it will remain \npredominantly in the extracellular space (and thus \u2153 of the given volume in the \nintravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic \nsaline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only.\nColloids: (eg Gelofusine\u00ae.) Have a high osmotic content similar to that of plasma \nand therefore remain in the intravascular space for longer than other \ufb02 uids, making \nthem appropriate for \ufb02 uid resuscitation, but not for general hydration. Colloids are \nexpensive, and may cause anaphylactic reactions. In reality, eff ective \ufb02 uid resuscita-\ntion will use a combination of colloid and 0.9% saline.\nHypertonic glucose (10% or 50%): May be used in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. \nIt is irritant to veins, so care in its use is needed. Infusion sites should be inspected \nregularly, and \ufb02 ushed with 0.9% saline after use.\nGlucose with sodium chloride: (One-\ufb01 fth \u2018normal saline.\u2019) Isotonic, containing 0.18% \nsaline (30mmol/L of Na\n+) and 4% glucose (222mmol/L). It has roughly the quantity of \nNa\n+ required for normal \ufb02 uid maintenance, when given 10-hourly in adults, but is now \nmost commonly used in a paediatric setting.\nHartmann\u2019s solution: Contains Na\n+ 131mmol, Cl\u03a9 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K\n+ \n5mmol, HCO3\n\u03a9 29mmol, and Ca\n2+ 2mmol per litre of \ufb02 uid. It is an alternative to 0.9% \nsaline, and some consider it more physiological.", "text_length": 3852, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 674/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 673, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.327100", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.327797", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
