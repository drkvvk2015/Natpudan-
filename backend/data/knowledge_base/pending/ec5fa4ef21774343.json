Patient may breathe spon\ntaneously (i.e. trigger the ventilator,\n\u2018assist\u2019\u2019\nbreaths) with ventilator augments breath to\nreach fixed volume or pressure (VC or PC)\n\u0004\nVOLUME CONTROL (VC)\nset tidal volume, machine\ninitiated inspiration\n\u0004\nPRESSURE CONTROL (PC)\nset pressure, machine\ninitiated inspiration\n\u0004\nVOLUME SUPPORT (VS)\nset tidal volume, patient\ninitiated inspiration (no backup rate, ventilator\nonly boosts airflow to pre determined level of\nvolume)\n\u0004\nPRESSURE\nSUPPORT (PS)\nset pressure, patient\ninitiated inspiration (no backup rate, ventilator\nonly boosts airflow to pre determined level of\npressure)\n\u0004\nSYNCHRONIZED INTERMITTENT MANDATORY (SIMV)\nmandatory positive pressure breaths delivered at\na preset rate and breath type (either volume cycled\nor pressure limited). Any other breaths patient\ntakes are normal spontaneous breaths with or\nwithout additional pressure/volume support (i.e.\npatient determines size of breath)\n\u0004\nPRESSURE-REGULATED\nVOLUME\nCONTROL (PRVC)\nsimilar to volume control ventilation, with the\nventilator monitoring all respiratory parameters\n(e.g. pressure) continually to maintain the tidal\nvolume set\n\u0004\nAIRWAY PRESSURE RELEASE VENTILATION (APRV)\na\nform of inverse ratio ventilation using two levels\nof CPAP (Phigh and Plow). This mode attempts\nto maximize mean airway pressure and thus\nalveolar recruitment at Phigh, while dropping\nbriefly to Plow for CO2 elimination. Used in refrac\ntory hypoxemia due to ALI/ARDS or massive\natelectasis\n\u0004\nHIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATORY VENTILATION (HFOV)\nemploys very high respiratory rates and very small\ntidal volumes. Goal is to maximize alveolar recruit\nment and to minimize ventilator induced lung\nVENTILATORY SETTINGS (CONT\u2019D)\ninjury. Often used in patients with refractory\nhypoxemia due to ALI/ARDS who fail conventional\nventilation\n\u0004\nCONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)\nallows a spontaneously breathing patient to\nbreathe at an elevated baseline airway pressure,\npermitting improved ventilation, decreased work\nof breathing, reduced atelectasis, and improved\ngas exchange. May be used as NIPPV (more com\nmon) or in intubated patients (generally referred\nto as PEEP with invasive ventilation)\n\u0004\nBILEVEL POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (BIPAP)\nconsists\nof inspiratory positive airway pressure phase (IPAP,\nstart at 12 cmH2O, up to 20 cmH2O) and expiratory\npositive airway pressure phase (EPAP, start at\n6 cmH2O, up to 10 cmH2O). IPAP leads to \" airflow\nwhich \" Ve and helps to # PCO2, whereas EPAP\nleads to \" FRC and mainly \" PO2.

Ideally, stable chest wall\nand good pain control.

VT >5 7 mL/\nkg, Ve <10 L, VC=12 15 mL/kg, NIF (negative\ninspiratory force) > 20 cmH2O, RSBI <100 (even\nbetter if <70)\nPROCESS FOR WEANING VENTILATED PATIENTS\n\u0004\nMEASURES\nPSV trial builds endurance. Cold nebu\nlizer trial builds strength. The less time the patient\nis on ventilator, the more normal their lung func\ntion, the simpler and shorter the weaning process.\nDaily spontaneous breathing trials significantly\nshorten the weaning process\n\u0004\nQUICK\nswitch directly to CPAP, cold neb, or bag\nger trial.
