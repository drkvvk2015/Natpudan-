Drug \ntherapy reduces the risk of CVD and death. Almost any adult over 50 would bene\ufb01 t \nfrom antihypertensives, whatever their starting BP. 48 Treatment is especially impor-\ntant if: BP is persistently \u2265160/100mmHg or cardio vascular risk \ue000 (10yr risk of vascular \ndisease \u226520%), or existing vascular disease or target organ damage (eg brain, kidney, \nheart, retina) with BP >140/90mmHg. Essential hypertension is not \u2018curable\u2019 and long-\nterm treatment is needed.\nTreatment goal <140/90mmHg (<130/80 in diabetes, 150/90 if aged >80). Reduce \nblood pressure slowly; rapid reduction can be fatal, especially in the context of an \nacute stroke. These may fall\u2014SPRINT49 showed a target of 120/80 was bene\ufb01 cial.\nLifestyle changes \ue001Concomitant risk factors: stop smoking; low-fat diet. Reduce \nalcohol and salt intake; increase exercise; reduce weight if obese.\nDrugs The ALLHAT study suggests that adequate BP reduction is more important than \nthe speci\ufb01 c drug used. 50 However, \ue020-blockers seem to be less eff ective than other \ndrugs at reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. \ue020-blockers and \nthiazides may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, Ca\n2+-channel blockers appear \nneutral, and ACE-i or ARB may reduce the risk. 44\nMonotherapy: If \u226555yrs, and in black patients of any age, 1st choice is a Ca\n2+-channel \nantagonist or thiazide. If <55, 1st choice is ACE-i (or ARB if ACE-i intolerant, eg cough). \n\ue020-blockers are not 1st line for hypertension, but consider in younger people, particu-\nlarly if: intolerance or contraindication to ACE-i/ARB, she is a woman of child-bearing \npotential, or there is \ue000sympathetic drive.\nCombination \ue057: ACE-i + Ca\n2+-channel antagonist or diuretic is logical, and has been \ncommonly used in trials. There is little evidence on using 3 drugs but current recom-\nmendation is ACE-i, Ca\n2+-channel antagonist, and thiazide.44 If BP still uncontrolled \non adequate doses of 3 drugs, add a 4th\u2014consider: spironolactone 25\u201350mg/24h or \nhigher-dose thiazide, but monitor U&E. Alternatively, \ue020-blocker, or selective \ue025-blocker \nand get help. Check compliance (urinary drug screen, or observed \ue057).\nDrug examples Thiazides: Eg chlortalidone 25\u201350mg/24h PO man\u00e9. SE: \ue001K\n+, \ue001Na\n+, \nimpotence. CI: gout. Ca\n2+-channel antagonists: Eg nifedipine MR, 30\u201360mg/24h PO. \nSE: \ufb02 ushes, fatigue, gum hyperplasia, ankle oedema; avoid short-acting form. ACE-i: \nEg lisinopril 10\u201340mg/24h PO (max 40mg/d). ACE-i may be 1st choice if co-existing LVF, \nor in diabetics (esp. if microalbuminuria, p314) or proteinuria. SE: cough, \ue000K\n+, renal \nfailure, angio-oedema. CI: bilateral renal artery or aortic valve stenosis; p114. ARB: \nCandesartan (8\u201332mg/d); caution if valve disease or cardiomyopathy; monitor K\n+. \nSE: vertigo, urticaria, pruritus. Useful if ACE-i induces cough. \ue058-blockers: Eg biso-\nprolol 2.5\u20135mg/24h PO. SE: bronchospasm, heart failure, cold peripheries, lethargy, \nimpotence. CI: asthma; caution in heart failure. Consider aspirin when BP controlled, \nif aged >55yrs. Add a statin if cholesterol raised. \ue007Most drugs take 4\u20138wks to gain \nmaximum eff ect: don\u2019t assess effi  cacy with just one BP measurement.\nMalignant hypertension (\ufb01 g 3.41) In general, use oral therapy, unless there is \nencephal opathy or CCF. The aim is for a controlled reduction in BP over days, not \nhours. Avoid sudden drops in BP as cerebral autoregulation is poor (\ue000stroke risk). \nBed rest; there is no ideal hypotensive, but atenolol or long-acting Ca\n2+ blockers may \nbe used PO.\nEncephalopathy: (Headache, focal CNS signs, seizures, coma.) Aim to reduce BP \nto ~110mmHg diastolic over 4h. Admit to monitored area. Insert intra-arterial line \nfor pressure monitoring. Either IV labetalol (eg 50mg IV over 1min, repeated every \n5min, max 200mg) or sodium nitroprusside infusion (0.5mcg/kg/min IVI titrated up \nto 8mcg/kg/min, eg 50mg in 1L glucose 5%; expect to give 100\u2013200mL/h for a few \nhours only, to avoid cyanide risk).\n\ue007Never use sublingual nifedipine to reduce BP (rapid drop in BP may cause stroke ). 51", "text_length": 4238, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 148/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 147, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.111904", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.112703", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
