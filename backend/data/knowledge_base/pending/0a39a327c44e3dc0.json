Risk factors: Diet, alcohol ex-\ncess, smoking, achalasia, re\ufb02 ux oesophagitis \u00b1 Barrett\u2019s oesophagus (p695); obesity, \nhot drinks, nitrosamine exposure, Plummer\u2013Vinson syndrome (p250). \ue032 : \ue033 \u2248 5 : 1.\nSite 20% occur in the upper part, 50% in the middle, and 30% in the lower part. \nThey may be squamous cell (proximal) or adenocarcinomas (distal; incidence rising).\nPresentation Dysphagia; \ue001weight; retrosternal chest pain. Signs from the upper \nthird of the oesophagus: Hoarseness; cough (may be paroxysmal if aspiration pneu-\nmonia). \ue059\ue059: See \u2018Dysphagia\u2019, p250.\nTests Oesophagoscopy with biopsy is the investigation of choice \u00b1 EUS, CT/MRI for stag-\ning (\ufb01 g 13.35), or laparoscopy if signi\ufb01 cant infra-diaphragmatic component. Staging: \nSee table 13.14.\nTreatment Survival rates are poor with or without treatment. If localized T1/T2 \ndisease, radical curative oesophagectomy may be tried. Pre-op chemotherapy (cis-\nplatin + \ufb02 uorouracil) for localized disease may improve survival, but causes some \nmorbidity. If surgery is not indicated, then chemo radiotherapy may be better than \nradiotherapy alone. Palliation in advanced disease aims to restore swallowing with \nchemo/radiotherapy, stenting, and laser use.", "text_length": 2328, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 626/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 625, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.255715", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.256625", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
