Pain is strictly unilateral and almost always af-\nfects the same side. It lasts 15\u2013180min, occurs once or twice a day, and is often \nnocturnal. Clusters last 4\u201312wks and are followed by pain-free periods of months \nor even 1\u20132yrs before the next cluster. Sometimes it is chronic, not episodic.\nTreatment Acute attack: \u2018Keep calm ... carry oxygen\u2019: give 100% O2 for ~15min via \nnon-rebreathable mask (not if COPD); sumatriptan SC 6mg at onset (or zolmitriptan \nnasal spray 5mg).\nPreventives Avoid triggers: Eg alcohol. Medication: Consider: corticosteroids \n(short term only; many SE); verapamil 360mg, lithium 900mg (monitor carefully).\nCluster headache\nSymptoms: Paroxysms of intense, stabbing pain, lasting seconds, in the trigemi-\nnal nerve distribution. It is unilateral, typically aff ecting mandibular or maxillary \ndiv isions. The face screws up with pain (hence tic douloureux). Triggers: Wash-\ning aff ec ted area, shaving, eating, talking, dental prostheses. Typical patient: \ue032 \n>50yrs old; in Asians \ue033:\ue032 \u2248 2:1. Secondary causes: Compres sion of the trigemi-\nnal root by anomalous or aneurysmal intracranial vessels or a tumour, chronic \nmeningeal in\ufb02 am mation, MS, zoster, skull base malformation (eg Chiari). MRI: Is \nnecessary to exclude secondary causes (~14% of cases). \ue057: Carba mazepine (start \nat 100mg/12h PO; max 400mg/6h; lamotrigine; phenytoin 200\u2013400mg/24h PO; or \ngabapentin (p504). If drugs fail, surgery may be necessary. This may be directed \nat the peripheral nerve, the trigeminal ganglion, or the nerve root. Microvascular \ndecompression: Anomalous vessels are separated from the trigem inal root. Ste-\nreotactic gamma knife surgery can work, but length of pain relief and the time to \ntreatment response are limiting factors.
