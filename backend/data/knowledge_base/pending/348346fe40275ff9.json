Free radicals, cyanide com-\npounds, and carbon monoxide (CO) accompany thermal injury. Cyanide (p842) \ncompounds (generated, eg from burning plastics) stop oxidative phosphorylation, \ncausing dizziness, headaches, and seizures. Tachycardia + dyspnoea soon give way \nto brady cardia + apnoea. CO is generated later in the \ufb01 re as oxygen is depleted.
