Cardiac output drops \nby 10\u201320% as the ventricles aren\u2019t primed reliably by the atria. AF is common in the el-\nderly (\u22649%). The main risk is embolic stroke. Warfarin reduces this to 1%/yr from 4%. \nSo, do an ECG on everyone with an irregular pulse (\u00b124h ECG if dizzy, faints, palpita-\ntions, etc.). If AF started more than 48h ago, intracardiac clots may have formed, ne-\ncessitating anticoagulation prior to cardioversion. see BOX \u2018Anticoagulation and AF\u2019.\nCauses Heart failure; hypertension; IHD (seen in 22% MI patients); 26 PE; mitral valve \ndisease; pneumonia; hyperthyroidism; caff eine; alcohol; post-op; \ue001K\n+; \ue001Mg\n2+. Rare \ncauses: Cardio myopathy; constrictive pericarditis; sick sinus syndrome; lung cancer; \nendo carditis; haemochromatosis; sarcoid. \u2018Lone\u2019 AF means no cause found.\nSymptoms May be asymptomatic or cause chest pain, palpitations, dysp noea, or \nfaintness. Signs Irregularly irregular pulse, the apical pulse rate is greater than \nthe radial rate, and the 1st heart sound is of variable intensity; signs of LVF (p800). \n\ue007Examine the whole patient: AF is often associated with non-cardiac disease.\nTests ECG shows absent P waves, irregular QRS complexes, \ufb01 g 3.35. Blood tests: U&E, \ncardiac enzymes, thyroid function tests. Echo to look for left atrial enlarge ment, \nmitral valve disease, poor LV function, and other structural abnormalities.\nManaging acute AF\n  \n\u2022 If the patient has adverse signs (shock, myocardial ischaemia (chest pain or ECG \nchanges), syncope, heart failure): \ue022ABCDE, get senior input \ue022DC cardioversion (syn-\nchronized shock, start at 120\u2013150J) \u00b1 amiodarone if unsuccessful (p807); do not \ndelay treatment in order to start anticoagulation.\n  \n\u2022 If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago: rate or rhythm control may be tried. \nFor rhythm control, DC cardiovert or give \ufb02 ecainide (CI: structural heart disease, \nIHD) or amiodarone. Start heparin in case cardioversion is delayed (see BOX \u2018Anti-\ncoagulation and AF\u2019).\n  \n\u2022 If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset: rate control \n(eg with bisoprolol or diltiazem). If rhythm control is chosen, the patient must be \nanticoagulated for >3wks \ufb01 rst.\n  \n\u2022 Correct electrolyte imbalances (K\n+, Mg\n2+, Ca\n2+); \ue014 associated illnesses (eg MI, pneu-\nmonia); and consider anticoagulation (see BOX \u2018Anticoagulation and AF\u2019).\nManaging chronic AF\nThe main goals are rate control and anticoagulation. Rate control is at least as good \nas rhythm control, 27 but rhythm control may be appropriate if \u2022 symptomatic or CCF \n\u2022 younger \u2022 presenting for 1st time with lone AF \u2022 AF from a corrected precipitant (eg \n\ue000\ue001U&E). Anticoagulation: See BOX \u2018Anticoagulation and AF\u2019.\nRate control: \ue020-blocker or rate-limiting Ca\n2+ blocker are 1st choice. If this fails, add \ndigoxin (p115), then consider amiodarone. Digoxin as monotherapy in chronic AF is \nonly acceptable in sedentary patients. \ue007Do not give \ue020-blockers with verapamil. Aim \nfor heart rate <90bpm at rest and 200 minus age (yrs) bpm on exertion. Avoid getting \n\ufb01 xated on a target heart rate.\nRhythm control: Elective DC cardioversion: do echo \ufb01 rst to check for intracardiac \nthrombi. If there is \ue000risk of cardioversion failure (past failure, or past recurrence) \ngive amiodarone for 4wks before the procedure and 12 months after. Elective phar-\nmacological cardioversion: \ufb02 ecainide is 1st choice (CI if structural heart disease, eg \nscar tissue from MI: use IV amiodarone instead). In refractory cases, AVN ablation \nwith pacing, pulmonary vein ablation, or the maze procedure may be considered.28\nParoxysmal AF: \u2018Pill in the pocket\u2019 (eg sotalol or \ufb02 ecainide PRN) may be tried if: infre-\nq uent AF, BP >100mmHg systolic, no past LV dysfunction. Anticoagulate (See BOX \n\u2018Anticoagulation and AF\u2019). Consider ablation if symptomatic or frequent episodes.\nAtrial \ufb02 utter See pp130\u20131, \ufb01 g 3.35. Treatment: Similar to AF regarding rate and \nrhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.29 DC cardioversion is preferred to \npharmacological cardioversion; start with 70\u2013120J. IV amiodarone may be needed if \nrate control is proving diffi  cult. Recurrence rates are high so radiofrequency ablation \nis often recommended for long-term management.", "text_length": 4497, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 138/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 137, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.095435", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.096167", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
