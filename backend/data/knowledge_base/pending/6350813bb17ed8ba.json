Can be used to assess:\nKidneys:\n  \n\u2022 Renal size\u2014small in chronic kidney disease, large in renal masses, cysts, hypertro-\nphy if other kidney missing, polycystic kidney disease (\ufb01 g 16.35), and rarities (eg \namyloidosis, p370).\n  \n\u2022 Hydronephrosis, which may indicate ureteric obstruction or re\ufb02 ux (\ufb01 g 13.49, p641).\n  \n\u2022 Perinephric collections (trauma, post-biopsy).\n  \n\u2022 Renal perfusion (assessment of renovascular disease: Doppler US of renal arteries).\n  \n\u2022 Transplanted kidneys (collections, obstruction, perfusion).\nLower urinary tract:\n  \n\u2022 Bladder volume: useful in assessment of the need to catheterize (see p640) or for \nassessment of adequacy of bladder emptying (post-micturition residual volume).\n  \n\u2022 Prostate: transrectal ultrasound enables US-guided biopsy of focal lesions. NB: pros-\ntate size does not correlate with symptoms.\nOther:\n  \n\u2022 Ovarian cysts, size, infections (pyosalpinx), uterine \ufb01 broids and other masses.\n  \n\u2022 Testicular masses, hydrocele, varicocele.\nAdvantages: Fast; cheap; independent of renal function; no IV contrast or radiation \nrisk. Disadvantages: Intraluminal masses (transitional cell ca) in the upper tracts \nmay not be seen; not a functional study; only suggests obstruction if there is dilata-\ntion of the collecting system (95% of obstructed kidneys) and so can miss obstruc-\ntion from, eg retroperitoneal \ufb01 brosis.\nCT (\ufb01 g 16.36) First choice in renal colic. Performed without intravenous contrast so \nsafe in renal impairment; such unenhanced images miss <2% of stones, but can show \nother pathologies. With IV contrast, CT can delineate masses (cystic or solid, contrast \nenhancement, calci\ufb01 cation, local/distant extension, renal vein involvement); assess \nrenal trauma (presence of two kidneys; haemorrhage; devascularization; laceration; \nurine leak); and show retroperitoneal lesions. CT has all but replaced intravenous \nurography and the radiation dose is similar.\nPlain abdominal X-ray Can be used to look at the kidneys, the paths of the ureters, \nand bladder. However, in practice it is only useful for monitoring known renal calculi.\nContrast studies Retrograde pyelography/ureterograms are good at showing \npelvi-calyceal, ureteric anatomy, and transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS). Contrast \nmedium is injected via a ureteric catheter. With the advent of cystoscopy, allowing \nimmediate intervention, these are rarely done in isolation. However, contrast me-\ndium is routinely used in cystoscopic placement of retrograde stents for obstruction.\nPercutaneous nephrostomy. Used in obstruction to decompress the renal pelvis, \nwhich is punctured under local anaesthetic with imaging guidance. Images are ob-\ntained following contrast injection (antegrade pyelogram). A nephrostomy tube is \nthen placed to allow decompression, sometimes followed by an antegrade stent if \nthere is no easily treatable cause of obstruction.\nRenal arteriography (\ufb01 g 16.37) Therapeutic indications: angioplasty; stenting; em-\nbolization (bleeding tumour, trauma, AV malformation).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Soft tissue resolution can help clarify equivo-\ncal CT \ufb01 ndings. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) helps image renal artery \nanatomy/stenosis (\ufb01 g 16.38) and is also used in the assessment of potential live do-\nnors for kidney transplant, as well as to monitor patients following embolization of \ntumours, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms.\nRadionuclide imaging See p738.", "text_length": 3609, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 752/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 751, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.470543", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.471305", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
