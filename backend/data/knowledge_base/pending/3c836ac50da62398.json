With 4 arms, tiny, wristed tremor-\nfree joints with multiple axes of rotation \nand high-resolution 3D imaging, the system \noff ers the potential for signi\ufb01 cant advances \nin minimally invasive surgery, which are cur-\nrently being realized across a range of \ufb01 elds. \nBut where is the surgeon in this picture? At \n\ufb01 rst glance, this technological tour de force \nmay appear to supplant the skill of the hu-\nman surgeon\u2014yet the machine must still \npossess an operator who must train and \nachieve all of the skills necessary to perform \nthis challenging surgery. The history of sur-\ngery is one of adaptation of surgical skills \nto new technologies, from anaesthesia and \nasepsis to organ transplantation and lapa-\nroscopy. How can training pathways adapt \nin turn to allow for acquisition of these new \nskills without unacceptable patient risk? \nAnd whatever the surgical approach, the old \nmaxim remains the same: the art of surgery \nlies in selecting the right operation at the \nright time for the right patient. \nWe thank Mr Antonio Foliaki, our Specialist Reader for this chapter, and Mr William Breakey, for their \ncontribution to this chapter.", "text_length": 2664, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 572/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 571, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.159205", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.160105", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
