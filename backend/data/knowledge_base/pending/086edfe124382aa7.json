When transplantation is awaited \nor not possible, there are two main options: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nHaemodialysis (HD) (\ufb01 g 7.6) Blood is \npassed over a semi-permeable membrane \nagainst dialysis \ufb02 uid \ufb02 owing in the oppo-\nsite direction. Diff usion of solutes occurs \ndown the concentration gradient. A hy-\ndrostatic gradient is used to clear excess \n\ufb02 uid as required (ultra\ufb01 ltration). Access is \npreferentially via an arteriovenous \ufb01 stula \nwhich provides \ue000blood \ufb02 ow and longevity. \nThis should be created prior to need for RRT \nto avoid the infection risk associated with central venous dialysis catheters. HD is \nneeded 3 times/week or more. Daily HD increases the \u2018dose\u2019 and improves outcomes. \nHome HD should be off ered to all suitable patients. Problems: Access (arteriovenous \n\ufb01 stula: thrombosis, stenosis, steal syndrome; tunnelled venous line: infection, block-\nage, recirculation of blood), dialysis dysequilibrium (between cerebral and blood sol-\nutes leading to cerebral oedema \ue018 start HD gradually), hypotension, time consuming.\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) Uses the peritoneum as a semi-permeable membrane. \nA catheter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity and \ufb02 uid infused. Solutes diff use \nslowly across. Ultra\ufb01 ltration is achieved by adding osmotic agents (glucose, glu-\ncose polymers) to the \ufb02 uid. It is a continuous process with intermittent drainage \nand re\ufb01 lling of the peritoneal cavity, performed at home. Problems: Catheter site \ninfection, PD peritonitis, hernia, loss of membrane function over time.\nHaemo\ufb01 ltration (\ufb01 g 7.7) Water cleared \nby positive pressure, dragging solutes into \nthe waste by convection. The ultra\ufb01 ltrate \n(waste) is replaced with an appropriate \nvolume of (\u2018clean\u2019) \ufb02 uid either before (pre-\ndilution) or after (post-dilution) the mem-\nbrane. \ue001Haemodynamic instability so used \nin critical care when HD not possible due \nto \ue001BP. Not used for chronic RRT unless in \ncombination with HD (haemodia\ufb01 ltration) \nfor haemodynamic stability and \ue000middle molecule clearance, eg \ue0202-microglobulin.\nComplications of RRT Annual mortality is signi\ufb01 cant, mostly due to cardiovascu-\nlar disease: \ue000BP, calcium/phosphate dysregulation, vascular stiff ness, in\ufb02 ammation, \noxidative stress, abnormal endothelial function. Protein-calorie malnutrition: In-\ncreases morbidity and mortality. Renal bone disease: High bone turnover, renal \nosteodystrophy, osteitis \ufb01 brosa. Infection: Uraemia causes granulocyte and T-cell \ndysfunction with \ue000sepsis-related mortality. Amyloid: \ue0202-microglobulin accumulates \nin long\u2013term dialysis causing carpal tunnel syndrome, arthralgia, visceral eff ects.\nConservative management is for those who opt not to receive RRT due to lack of \nbene\ufb01 t on quality or quantity of life. Focus is on preserving residual renal function, \nsymptom control, and advanced planning with patient and family for end-of-life care.\nWaste\nremoved\nFluid \nin\nBlood \nin\nDialysate\nBlood\nreturned\nBlood\nFig 7.6 Haemodialysis.\nWaste out\nPost\ndilution\nPre-\ndilution\nBlood\nreturned\nBlood \nin\nDialysate\nBlood\nFig 7.7 Haemo\ufb01 ltration.", "text_length": 3827, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 314/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 313, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.707096", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.707704", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
