Exercise helps (\ue000HDL, \ue000glucose tolerance). Use lifelong anticoagulation in AF \n(see BOX \u2018Cardiac causes of stroke\u2019) and prosthetic heart valves. \u2022 For prevention \npost-TIA see p476.\nSecondary prevention (Ie preventing further strokes.)\nControl risk factors (as Primary prevention mentioned above): there is a considerable \nadvantage from lowering blood pressure and cholesterol (even if not particularly raised). \nAntiplatelet agents after stroke: (See BOX \u2018Antiplatelets\u2019.) If no primary haemorrhage \non CT, give 2 weeks of aspirin 300mg, then switch to long-term clopidogrel monother-\napy. If this is CI or not tolerated then give low dose aspirin plus slow-release dipyrida-\nmole. Anticoagulation after stroke from AF: See BOX \u2018Cardiac causes of stroke\u2019.\nTests (See p470 for imaging.) Investigate promptly to identify risk factors for fur-\nther strokes, but consider whether results will aff ect management. Look for:\n  \n\u2022 Hypertension. Look for retinopathy (p560), nephropathy, or cardiomegaly on CXR.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac source of emboli. (See BOX \u2018Cardiac causes of stroke\u2019.) 24h ECG to look \nfor AF (p130). CXR may show an enlarged left atrium. Echocardiogram may reveal \nmural thrombus due to AF or a hypokinetic segment of cardiac muscle post-MI. \nIt may also show valvular lesions in infective endocarditis or rheumatic heart \ndisease. Trans oesophageal echo is more sensitive than transthoracic.\n  \n\u2022 Carotid artery stenosis. Do carotid Doppler US \u00b1 CT/MRI angiography. Bene\ufb01 ts and \nrisks of revascularization should be individualized by an expert but generally most \nwith \u2265 70% stenosis and life expectancy \u2265 5yrs will bene\ufb01 t while some (especially \n\ue032) will bene\ufb01 t with 50\u201369% stenosis\n7 (see p476). Carotid endarterectomy is the \nprocedure of choice; endovascular carotid artery angioplasty with stenting is an \nalternative for those un\ufb01 t for surgery and achieves similar long-term outcomes but \nhas higher peri-procedure stroke and mortality rates. \n  \n\u2022 Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and hyperhomocysteinaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Vasculitis. \ue000ESR, ANCA (p556). VDRL to look for active, untreated syphilis (p412).\n  \n\u2022 Prothrombotic states, eg thrombophilia (p374), antiphospholipid syndrome (p554).\n  \n\u2022 Hyperviscosity, eg polycythaemia (p366), sickle-cell disease (p340).\n  \n\u2022 Thrombocytopenia and other bleeding disorders.\n  \n\u2022 Genetic tests. CADASIL (p470); Fabry disease (p698).\nPrognosis Overall mortality: 60 000/yr; UK 20% at 1 month, then \ue00510%/yr. Full recov-\nery: \u2264 40%. Drow si ness \u2248 poor prognosis. Avoid pressure ulcers (\ufb01 g 10.16).\n7 Interventions for 50\u201369% stenoses can be justi\ufb01 able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In \nparticular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto-\nmatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50\u201369% range as \ncompared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group) criteria.", "text_length": 3300, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 480/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 479, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.995539", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.996256", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
