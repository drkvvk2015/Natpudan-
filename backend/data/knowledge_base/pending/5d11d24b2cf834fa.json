Minimally invasive surgery is also used for thyroidectomy and par-\nathyroidectomy.\nAs a rule of thumb, whatever can be done by laparotomy can also be done with \nthe laparoscope. This does not mean that it should be done, but if the surgeon is \nadequately trained, and the patient feels better sooner, has less post-operative pain, \ncan return to work earlier, and has fewer complications, then there are obvious \nadvantages. Pre-procedure counselling should always discuss the complications of \nlaparoscopic surgery (eg accidental damage to other intra-abdominal organs) as \nwell as the risk of conversion to an open procedure.\nChallenges of minimal access surgery The 2-dimensional visual representation \nand diff erent surgical approach alters the normal appearance of familiar anatomy. \nPalpation is impossible and it may be harder to locate lesions prior to resection. As \na result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be \nlearned and taught.\nDay-case surgery Advances in surgical techniques as well as perioperative care \nmean better results for the patient (shorter waiting lists, fewer infections, fewer \ndays off  work, and \ue000patient satisfaction). Many operations can now be performed as \nday cases. Theoretically any procedure is suitable, provided the time under general \nanaesthetic does not exceed ~1h. The use of regional anaesthesia helps to avoid the \nSE of nausea and disorientation that may accompany a general anaesthetic, thus \nfacilitating discharge.\nBear in mind that the following groups of patients may not be suitable for day-case \nsurgery: \u2022Severe dementia. \u2022Severe learning diffi  culties. \u2022Living alone (and no helpers). \n\u2022Children if supervision diffi  cult\u2014changes in expectation, delays, and pain relief can \nbe problematic. \u2022BMI >32 (p244). \u2022ASA category \u2265 III (p567) thus potentially unstable \ncomorbidities\u2014discuss with the anaesthetist. \u2022Infection at the site of the operation. \nAll surgeons get better over time (for a while), as they perform new techniques \nwith increasing ease and con\ufb01 dence. When Wertheim did his \ufb01 rst hysterectomies, \nhis \ufb01 rst dozen patients died\u2014but then one survived. He assumed it was a good \noperation, and pressed ahead. He was a brave man, and thousands of women owe \ntheir lives to him. But had he tried to do this today, he would have been stopped. \nThe UK\u2019s General Medical Council (GMC) and other august bodies tell us that we \nmust protect the public by reporting doctors whose patients have low survival \nrates. The reason for this is partly ethical, and partly to preserve self-regulation.\nWe have the toughest codes of practice and disciplinary procedures of any group \nof workers. It is assumed that doctors are loyal to each other out of self-interest, \nand that this loyalty is bad. This has never been tested formally, and is not evi-\ndence-based. We can imagine two clinical worlds: one of constant \u2018reportings\u2019 and \nrecriminatory audits, and another of trust and team-work. Both are imperfect, \nbut we should not assume that the \ufb01 rst world would be better for our patients.\nWhen patients are sick with fear, they do not, perhaps, want to know every-\nthing. We may tell to protect ourselves. We may not tell to protect ourselves. \nPerhaps what we should do is, in our hearts, appeal to those 12 dead women-of-\nWertheim\u2014a jury as infallible as sacri\ufb01 cial\u2014and try to hear their reply. And to \nthose who complain that in doing so we are playing God, it is possible to reply with \nsome humility that, whatever it is, it does not seem like play.\n\u2018It is amazing what little harm doctors do when one considers all the opportuni-\nties they have.\u2019 M. Twain.\nExposing patients to our learning curves?
