Oral morphine is 1st-line. If the oral route is unavailable, use mor-\nphine or diamorphine SC (see table 11.5, and tables 11.6, 11.7, p536). Explanation and \nregular review are important. Prescribe anti-emetics and laxatives for all patients.\nStart low, go slow: For an opioid-na\u00efve patient with moderate to severe pain, con-\nsider oral morphine 5mg every 4 hours plus 5mg PRN (maximum hourly). Consider \na lower starting dose if elderly, \ue001BMI, or renal impairment. If pain is not controlled, \n\ue000 dose by 30\u201350% every 24h.\nConvert to modi\ufb01 ed release: When pain is controlled, calculate the total daily \ndose including PRN and divide into two 12h doses of a modi\ufb01 ed-release preparation \n(eg MST Continus\u00ae 12h). Transdermal preparations are available: seek expert help \nfor dose, check adhesion, and rotate site.\nUse a PRN dose for breakthrough pain: 1/10th\u20131/6th of the total daily dose as an \nimmediate-release preparation, eg Oramorph\u00ae or Sevredol\u00ae.\nSide-effects: Drowsiness, nausea/vomiting (usually \ue001 after 5 days), constipation, \ndry mouth. If diffi  culty tolerating morphine, or pain plus toxicity, consider an opi-\noid switch (eg oxycodone) and \ue001 dose by 25\u201330%.\nToxicity: Sedation, respiratory depression, visual hallucinations, myoclonic jerks, \ndelirium. Be alert: recognizing toxicity early usually means naloxone is avoided. \nMonitor pulse oximetry, give oxygen if required. Consider \ue031\ue031: intracranial bleed, \nrenal failure. \ue001 Opioids and sedating drugs. Consider hydration. Seek expert help \nif remains opioid-toxic or in pain. \ue007Naloxone is only indicated for life-threatening \nrespiratory depression (see p842). In patients on regular opiates it can precipitate \na pain crisis and potentially fatal acute withdrawal.18\nRenal failure: Patients with renal impairment (eGFR <30) are at risk of toxicity \ndue to accumulation of renally excreted opioids and metabolites. Monitor closely. \nFentanyl, alfentanil, and buprenorphine have predominantly hepatic metabolism \n\u2014seek expert advice.\nConcerns: Patients may shrink from using opioids. Misconceptions are common: \nthey are addictive, for the dying, if they use morphine now it will not work when \nthey really need it. Respiratory depression is very rare when opioids are correctly \ntitrated but opioids often get blamed when a patient deteriorates. Reassure pa-\ntients that opioids are effective and safe when used appropriately.\nMorphine-resistant pain: Seek expert help. Consider methadone, ketamine, and \nadjuvants such as NSAIDS, steroids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, nerve blocks. If \nneuropathic pain is suspected, try amitriptyline, pregabalin, or topical lidocaine. \nConsider the eff ect of psychological and spiritual well-being on pain (see p535).\nRapid analgesia: Most PRN medication takes time to have an eff ect. If this is a \nproblem, seek expert help regarding rapid-release preparations (eg sublingual, \nintranasal, or buccal fentanyl). Try to pre-empt times of high pain (eg dressing \nchanges) and give analgesia in advance.\nTable 11.5 Opioid dose equivalents: conversions are not exact, potency can vary.
