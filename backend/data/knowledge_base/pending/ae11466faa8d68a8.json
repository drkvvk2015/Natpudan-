There are four classes: \nchylomicrons and VLDL (mainly triglyceride), LDL (mainly cholesterol), and HDL (mainly \nphospho lipid) (for abbreviations see footnote\n3). The evidence that cholesterol is a \nmajor risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is undisputed (\u20184S\u2019 STUDY, 21 WOSCOPS, 22 \nCARE STUDY, 23 HEART PROTECTION STUDY 24) and indeed it may even be the \u2018green light\u2019 that \nallows other risk factors to act. 25 Half the UK population have a serum cholesterol \nputting them at signi\ufb01 cant risk of CVD. HDL appears to correlate inversely with CVD.\nWho to screen for hyperlipidaemia\n\ue007NB: full screening requires a fasting lipid pro\ufb01 le.\nThose at risk of hyperlipidaemia: \u2022Family history of hyperlipidaemia. \u2022Corneal ar-\ncus <50yrs old. \u2022Xanthomata or xanthelasmata (\ufb01 g 14.13).\nThose at risk of CVD: \u2022Known CVD. \u2022Family history of CVD <60yrs old. \u2022DM or impaired \nglucose tolerance. \u2022Hypertension. \u2022Smoker. \u2022\ue000BMI. \u2022Low socioeconomic or Indian \nAsian background.\nTypes of hyperlipidaemia\nCommon primary hyperlipidaemia: Accounts for 70% of hyperlipidaemia. \ue000LDL only.\nFamilial primary hyperlipidaemias: Multiple phenotypes exist (see table 14.8). Risk \nof \ue000\ue000CVD, although evidence suggests protection from CVD is achieved with lower \ndoses of statin than for common primary hyperlipidaemia. 26 Refer to specialist.\nSecondary hyperlipidaemia: Causes include: Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypothyroidism, \nnephrotic syndrome, or cholestasis. \ue000LDL. Treat the cause \ufb01 rst.\nMixed hyperlipidaemia: Results in \ue000 in both LDL and triglycerides. Caused by type \n2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure.\nManagement \nIdentify familial or 2\u00b0 hyperlipidaemias, as \ue014 may diff er. Give lifestyle advice; aim for \nBMI of 20\u201325; encourage a Mediterranean-style diet\u2014\ue000fruit, vegetables, \ufb01 sh, unsatu-\nrated fats; and \ue001red meat; \ue000exercise. Top \ue014 priority are those with known CVD (there \nis no need to calculate their risk: ipso facto they already have high risk). Second \n\ue014 priority is primary prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease or type-1 \ndiabetes, and those with a 10-yr risk of CVD >10%, irrespective of baseline lipid levels.\n  \n\u2022 1st-line therapy: Atorvastatin 20mg PO at night, for primary prevention, and 80mg \nfor secondary prevention and primary prevention in those with kidney disease.27 \nSimvastatin 40mg, is an alternative. \ue001cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibit-\ning HMGCOA reductase. CI: porphyria, cholestasis, pregnancy. SE: myalgia \u00b1 myositis \n(stop if \ue000CK \u226510-fold; if any myalgia, check CK; risk is 1 per 100 000 treatment-years),28 \nabdominal pain, and \ue000LFTS (stop if AST \ue006100U/L). Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (p689) \n\ue000serum concentrations (200mL of grapefruit juice \ue000simvastatin concentration by \n300%, and atorvastatin \ue00080%, but pravastatin is almost unchanged). Current guide-\nlines suggest a target plasma cholesterol reduction of \u226540 % in those with CVD.\n  \n\u2022 2nd-line therapy: Ezetimibe\u2014a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, may be used in \nstatin intolerance or combination with statins to achive target reduction.\n  \n\u2022 3rd-line therapy: Alirocumab\u2014a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 (acts to \nreduce hepatocyte LDL receptor expression). Very eff ective in reducing LDL,29 but \nexpensive and needs to be given by injection every 2 weeks. Others: \ufb01 brates, eg \nbeza\ufb01 brate (useful in mixed hyperlipidaemias); anion exchange resins, eg colesty-\nramine; nicotinic acid (\ue000HDL; \ue001LDL; SE: severe \ufb02 ushes; aspirin 300mg \u00bdh pre-dose \nhelps this).\n  \n\u2022 Hypertriglyceridaemia: Responds best to \ufb01 brates, nicotinic acid, or \ufb01 sh oil.\nXanthomata These yellow lipid deposits may be: eruptive (itchy nodules in crops \nin hypertriglyceridaemia); tuberous (plaques on elbows and knees); or planar\u2014also \ncalled palmar (orange streaks in palmar creases), \u2018diagnostic\u2019 of remnant hyperlipid-\naemia; or in tendons (p38), eyelids (xanthelasma, see \ufb01 g 14.13), or cornea (arcus, p39).\n3 Abbreviations: (V)LDL = (very) low-density lipoprotein; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein;\nHDL = high-density lipoprotein; chol = cholesterol; trig = trigylcerides.", "text_length": 4276, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 698/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 697, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.371109", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.371964", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
