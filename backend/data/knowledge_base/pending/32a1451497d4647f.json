Adenocarcin omas and squa-\nmous cell carcinomas are rare in the West (the latter may follow schistosomiasis). \nUK incidence \u2248 1:6000/yr. \ue032:\ue033\u22485:2. Histology is important for prognosis: Grade 1\u2014\ndiff erentiated; Grade 2\u2014intermediate; Grade 3\u2014poorly diff er entiated. 80% are con-\n\ufb01 ned to bladder mucosa, and only ~20% penetrate muscle (increasing mortality to \n50% at 5yrs).\nPresentation Painless haematuria; recurrent UTIs; voiding irritability.\nAssociations Smoking; aromatic amines (rubber industry); chronic cystitis; schisto-\nsomiasis (\ue000risk of squamous cell carcinoma); pelvic irradiation.\nTests\n  \n\u2022 Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic.\n  \n\u2022 Urine: microscopy/cytology (cancers may cause sterile pyuria).\n  \n\u2022 CT urogram is both diagnostic and provides staging.\n  \n\u2022 Bimanual EUA helps assess spread.\n  \n\u2022 MRI or lymphangiography may show involved pelvic nodes.\nStaging See table 13.19.\nTreating TCC of the bladder\n  \n\u2022 Tis/Ta/T1: (80% of all patients) Diathermy via transurethral cystoscopy/trans-\nurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Consider a regimen of intravesical \nBCG (which stimulates a non-speci\ufb01 c immune response) for multiple small tumours \nor high-grade tumours. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include mitomycin, \nepirubicin and gemcitabine. 5yr survival \u2248 95%.\n  \n\u2022 T2\u20133: Radical cystectomy is the \u2018gold standard\u2019. Radiotherapy gives worse 5yr \nsurvival rates than surgery, but preserves the bladder. \u2018Salvage\u2019 cystectomy can \nbe performed if radiotherapy fails, but yields worse results than primary sur-\ngery. Post-op chemotherapy (eg M-VAC: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, \nand cisplatin) is toxic but eff ective. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC or GC \n(gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or ra-\ndiotherapy alone. Methods to preserve the bladder with transurethral resection or \npartial cyst ectomy + systemic chemo therapy have been tried, but long-term results \nare disappointing. If the bladder neck is not involved, orthotopic reconstr uction \nrather than forming a urostoma is an option (both using ~40cm of the patient\u2019s \nileum), but adequate tumour clearance must not be compromised. \ue007The patient \nshould have all these options explained by a urologist and an oncologist.\n  \n\u2022 T4: Usually palliative chemo/radiotherapy. Chronic catheterization and urinary di-\nversions may help to relieve pain.\nFollow-up History, examination, and regular cystoscopy: \u2022High-risk tumours: Every \n3 months for 2yrs, then every 6 months. \u2022Low-risk tumours: First follow-up cystos-\ncopy after 9 months, then yearly.\nTumour spread Local \ue003 to pelvic structures; lymphatic \ue003 to iliac and para-aortic \nnodes; haematogenous \ue003 to liver and lungs.\nSurvival This depends on age at surgery. For example, the 3yr survival after cystec-\ntomy for T2 and T3 tumours is 60% if 65\u201375yrs old, falling to 40% if 75\u201382yrs old (op-\nerative mortality is 4%). With unilateral pelvic node involvement, only 6% of patients \nsurvive 5yrs. The 3yr survival with bilateral or para-aortic node involvement is nil.\nComplications Cystectomy can result in sexual and urinary malfunction. Massive \nbladder haemorrhage may complicate treatment or be a feature of disease treated \npalliatively. Determining the cause of bleeding is key.
