On occasion, other \nareas of myocardium will set the pace (see earlier in chapter). If the heart is not \npacing itself fast enough, arti\ufb01 cial pacing may be required. Options include \u2018percus-\nsion pacing\u2019\u2014\ufb01 st strikes to the precordium, used only in periarrest situations; trans-\ncutaneous pacing\u2014electrical stimulation via de\ufb01 brillator pads (p770); temporary \ntransvenous pacing (p776); and a subcutaneously implanted permanent pacemaker.\nIndications for temporary cardiac pacing include\n  \n\u2022 Symptomatic bradycardia, unresponsive to atropine.\n  \n\u2022 After acute anterior MI, prophylactic pacing is required in:\n  \n\u2022 complete AV block\n  \n\u2022 Mobitz type I AV block (Wenckebach)\n  \n\u2022 Mobitz type II AV block\n  \n\u2022 non-adjacent bifascicular, or trifascicular block (p100).\n  \n\u2022 After inferior MI, pacing may not be needed in complete AV block if reasonably \nstable, rate is >40\u201350, and QRS complexes are narrow.\n  \n\u2022 Suppression of drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias by overdrive pacing, eg SVT, VT.\n  \n\u2022 Special situations: during general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during elec-\ntrophysiological studies; drug overdose (eg digoxin, \ue020-blockers, verapamil).\n\ue007See p776 for further details and insertion technique.\nIndications for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) include\n  \n\u2022 Complete AV block (Stokes\u2013Adams attacks, asymptomatic, congenital).\n  \n\u2022 Mobitz type II AV block (p99).\n  \n\u2022 Persistent AV block after anterior MI.\n  \n\u2022 Symptomatic bradycardias (eg sick sinus syndrome, p125).\n  \n\u2022 Heart failure (cardiac resynchronization therapy).\n  \n\u2022 Drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias.\nPre-operative assessment Bloods (FBC, clotting screen, renal function), IV cannula, \nconsent, antibiotics as per local protocol.\nPost-operative management Prior to discharge, check wound for bleeding or hae-\nmatoma; check lead positions and for pneumothorax on CXR; check pacemaker func-\ntion. During 1st week, inspect for wound haematoma or dehiscence. Other problems: \nlead fracture or dislodgement; pacemaker interference (eg from patient\u2019s muscles); \ninfected device. The battery needs changing every 5\u201310 years. For driving rules see \np158.\nPacemaker letter codes These enable pacemaker identi\ufb01 cation (min is 3 letters):\n  \n\u2022 1st letter the chamber paced (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber).\n  \n\u2022 2nd letter the chamber sensed (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber, O=none).\n  \n\u2022 3rd letter the pacemaker response (T=triggered, I=inhibited, D=dual).\n  \n\u2022 4th letter (R=rate modulation, P=programmable, M=multiprogrammable).\n  \n\u2022 5th letter (P means that in tachy cardia the pacemaker will pace the patient. \nS means that in tachycardia the pace maker shocks the patient. D=dual ability to \npace and shock. O=neither of these).\nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Improves the synchronization of cardi-\nac contraction and reduces mortality31 in people with symptomatic heart failure who \nhave an ejection fraction <35% and a QRS duration >120ms.32 It involves biventricular \npacing (both septal and lateral walls of the LV) and, if required, also an atrial lead. It \nmay be combined with a de\ufb01 brillator (CRT-D).\nECG of paced rhythms (\ufb01 g 3.13 and \ufb01 g 3.36). Pacemaker input appears as a vertical \n\u2018spike\u2019 on the ECG. This spike can be very small with modern bipolar pacing systems. \nVentricular pacing usually has a broad QRS morphology (similar to LBBB). Systems are \nusually programmed \u2018on demand\u2019 so will only pace when necessary. Modern systems \nare generally very reliable but pacing spikes with no capture afterwards suggests \na problem. Programming of devices is complicated so seek help early if concerned. \nMany pacemakers store intracardiac electrograms which can be accessed to cor-\nrelate rhythm with any symptoms.", "text_length": 3885, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 140/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 139, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.098082", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.098795", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
