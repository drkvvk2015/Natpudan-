Cryptococcus neofor\nmans has two varieties: C. neoformans var. neofor\nmans and var. gattii\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n\u0002 C. NEOFORMANS\nalmost invariably in immunocom\npromised patients including HIV with CD4 <100/\nmm3, transplantation, hematologic malignancies,\nchronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, cirrho\nsis, or corticosteroid use. This pathogen is inhaled,\nthen disseminates with predilection for CNS with\nmeningitis more common than focal parenchymal\ninfections\n\u0002 C. GATTII\nseen more commonly in immunocom\npetent hosts and paradoxically uncommon in\nimmunosuppressed hosts. Symptomatic infection\nis usually pulmonary \u0006 focal parenchymal brain\ninfection\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nCNS, pulmonary, and cuta\nneous involvement (but may involve any organ)\nTREATMENTS\nCNS infection (lumbar puncture to\nlower intracranial pressure, amphotericin B plus flu\ncytosine, followed by fluconazole), pulmonary or\ncutaneous infection (fluconazole or itraconazole)\nCID 2010 50:3\nCOCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nendemic to lower deserts of\nsouthern Arizona, central California, southwestern\nNew Mexico, and west Texas in USA. Also Mexico,\nCentral and South America. Peak incidence from\nMay July and October December. Affects mostly\npatients with immunosuppression\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nan acute pulmonary infection\nthat is often asymptomatic, but can cause a flu like\nillness or pneumonia. Pulmonary symptoms include\nchest pain, cough, fever, and hemoptysis if cavitary\nlesions. Radiologically, unilateral infiltrate and hilar\nadenopathy are common. Cutaneous symptoms\ninclude erythema nodosum and erythema multi\nforme. Most common sites of dissemination are\nskin, bone, and meninges\nDIAGNOSIS\nfungal culture and serology. Note that\nCocciodioides is a level 3 pathogen. Therefore, cul\ntures should be processed in high level isolation unit\nand labeled carefully. There have been numerous\nreports of iatrogenic infection of laboratory personnel\nwhen adequate precautions not taken\nTREATMENTS\nusually resolves spontaneously if\nuncomplicated disease. Antifungal therapy may\nneed to be combined with surgery for certain pul\nmonary infections. Fluconazole 400 mg PO daily, itra\nconazole 200 mg PO daily (duration dependent on\nsite of infection and may last months to years). Cocci\ndioides meningitis should be treated with amphoter\nicin B\nCID 2005 41:9\nBLASTOMYCES\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nmostly found in northwest\nOntario, the Great Lakes, and some Eastern states\n(e.g. Ohio, Mississippi River valley).
