They tend to, although not always, aff ect the axial skeleton with shared clinical \nfeatures:\n1   Seronegativity (= rheumatoid factor \u03a9ve).\n2   HLA B27 association\u2014see BOX.\n3   \u2018Axial arthritis\u2019: pathology in spine (spondylo-) and sacroiliac joints.\n4   Asymmetrical large-joint oligoarthritis (ie <5 joints) or monoarthritis.\n5   Enthesitis: in\ufb02 ammation of the site of insertion of tendon or ligament into bone, \neg plantar fasc iitis, Achilles tendonitis, costochondritis.\n6   Dactylitis: in\ufb02 ammation of an entire digit (\u2018sausage digit\u2019), due to soft tissue \noedema, and tenosynovial and joint in\ufb02 ammation.\n7   Extra-articular manifestations: eg iritis (anterior uveitis), psoriaform rashes \n(psoriatic arthritis), oral ulcers, aortic valve incompetence, in\ufb02 ammatory bowel \ndisease.\nNB: Beh\u00c7et\u2019s syndrome (p694) can also present with uveitis, skin lesions, and  arthritis \nand is not always associated with gross oral or genital ulcerations.\n1   Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) A chronic in\ufb02 ammatory disease of the spine and \nsacroiliac joints, of unknown aetiology (likely strong genetic/environmental in-\nterplay). Prevalence: 0.25\u20131%. Men present earlier: \ue032:\ue033 ~6:1 at 16yrs old, and \n~2:1 at 30yrs old. ~90% are HLA B27 +ve (see BOX). Symptoms and signs: The \ntypical patient is a man <30yrs old with gradual onset of low back pain, worse \nduring the night with spinal morning stiff ness relieved by exercise. Pain radi-\nates from sacroiliac joints to hips/buttocks, and usually improves towards the \nend of the day. There is progressive loss of spinal movement (all directions)\u2014\nhence \ue001thoracic expansion. See pp540\u20132 for tests of spine \ufb02 exion and sacroiliitis. \nThe disease course is variable; a few progress to kyphosis, neck hyperextension \n(question-mark posture; \ufb01 g 12.13), and spino-cranial ankylosis. Other features \ninclude enthesitis (see BOX), especially Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, at the \ntibial and ischial tuberosities, and at the iliac crests. Anterior mechanical chest \npain due to costochondritis and fatigue may feature. Acute iritis occurs in ~\u2153 \nof patients and may lead to blindness if untreated (but may also have occurred \nmany years before, so enquire directly). AS is also associated with osteoporosis \n(up to 60%), aortic valve incompetence (<3%), and pulmonary apical \ufb01 brosis.\nTests: Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging.\n4 MRI allows detection of active \nin\ufb02 ammation (bone marrow oedema) as well as destructive changes such as \nerosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis. X-rays can show SI joint space narrowing or \nwidening, sclerosis, erosions, and ankylosis/fusion. Vertebral syndesmophytes \nare characteristic (often T11\u2013L1 initially): bony proliferations due to enthesitis \nbetween ligaments and vertebrae. These fuse with the vertebral body above, \ncausing ankylosis. In later stages, calci\ufb01 cation of ligaments with ankylosis lead \nto a \u2018bamboo spine\u2019 appearance. Also: FBC (normocytic anaemia), \ue000ESR, \ue000CRP, HLA \nB27 +ve (+ve in 90\u201395% of cases but only 5% of patients HLA B27 +ve have AS). \nManagement: Exercise, not rest, for backache, including intense exercise regi-\nmens to maintain posture and mobility\u2014ideally with a specialist physiotherapist. \nNSAIDS usually relieve symptoms within 48h, and may slow radiographic progres-\nsion.37 TNF\ue025 BLOCKERS (eg etanercept, adalimumab) are indicated in severe ac-\ntive AS.38 Local steroid injections provide temporary relief. Surgery includes hip \nreplacement to improve pain and mobility if the hips are involved, and rarely spinal \n osteotomy. There is \ue000risk of osteoporotic spinal fractures (consider bisphospho-\nnates). Prognosis: There is not always a clear relationship between the activity \nof arthritis and severity of underlying in\ufb02 ammation (as for all the spondyloarth-\nritides). Prognosis is worse if ESR >30; onset <16yrs; early hip involvement or poor \nresponse to NSAIDS.39\n2   Enteric arthropathy Associations: In\ufb02 ammatory bowel disease, GI bypass, \ncoeliac and Whipple\u2019s disease (p716). Arthropathy often improves with the treat-\nment of bowel symptoms (beware NSAIDS). Use DMARDS for resistant cases.\n4 Sacroiliitis on imaging plus \u22651 SpA feature or HLA B27 positive plus \u22652 SpA features.", "text_length": 4407, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 558/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 557, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.136696", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.137601", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
