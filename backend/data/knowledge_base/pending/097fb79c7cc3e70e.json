If debridement and retention are not\nappropriate, removal of the infected prosthesis\nwith one stage or two stage exchange; IV antibio\ntic therapy is also provided for 6 weeks following\nthe initial surgery\nNEJM 2009 361:8\nSeptic Arthritis\nSee SEPTIC ARTHRITIS (p. 273)\nTuberculosis: Pulmonary\nNEJM 1999 340:5; NEJM 2001 345:3;\nNEJM 2004 350:20\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nORGANISMS\ngenus\nMycobacterium consists\nof\n>50 species. TB is caused by M. tuberculosis complex\nincluding M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and others. The\ncell envelope contains mycolic acid ! resists destain\ning by acid alcohol, thus termed acid fast bacilli\nTRANSMISSION\nTB transmission is almost exclu\nsively airborne through inhalation of minute droplet\nnuclei. Therefore, lungs are the primary focus. How\never, any organs can become infected during the\nbacteremia that follows initial lung infection\nLATENT TB INFECTION (LTBI)\nfollows initial infec\ntion; asymptomatic; detected by tuberculin skin test.\nRisk of active infection generally is 5% in the first 2\nyears with 5% risk of reactivation thereafter\nFACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF INFEC\nTION\n1/3 of the world\u2019s population is infected\nwith TB. Birth in endemic area (less commonly travel)\nis the major risk factor; other risk factors include\naboriginal populations and racial/ethnic minorities,\nhousehold/institutional\ncontacts\nand\ncrowding\n(healthcare workers, long term care, correctional\nfacilities, substance abuse, and shelters)\nFACTORS INCREASING THE RISK OF REACTIVA\nTION OF LTBI\nHIV infection (most important risk\nfactor, always test those with active TB for HIV),\nfibronodular disease on CXR, chronic renal failure,\nincreasing age, malignancy, transplant/immunosup\npression,\nsilicosis,\nchronic\nsteroid\nuse,\nTNF a\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY (CONT\u2019D)\ninhibitors, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, liver or kidney\ndisease, poorly controlled diabetes, smoking, gas\ntrectomy, jejunoileal bypass\nCLINICAL FEATURES\nPRIMARY TB\n\u0002\nSYMPTOMS\nfever, night sweats, pleuritic chest\npain, chronic cough, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue,\nerythema nodosum\n\u0002\nSIGNS\noften none. Primary TB usually involves the\nmediastinal lymph nodes; hilar lymphadenopathy\nin the presence of RML collapse is the most com\nmon radiologic finding (2/3) with pleural effusion\nin 1/3. Lung infiltrates may be seen and involve\nlower lungs or middle lung fields most commonly\nwith possible cavitation in areas of consolidation\nREACTIVATION TB (active pulmonary)\n\u0002\nSYMPTOMS\ncough,\nyellow green\nsputum\n(increases over time), hemoptysis (25%), chest\npain/dyspnea (33%), fever/night sweats (50%),\nfatigue (50 66%), weight loss\n\u0002\nSIGNS\nreactivation TB usually involves the apical\nposterior segments of upper lobes (80 90%), cavi\ntation (19 40%), hilar lymphadenopathy (more\nlikely than cavitation in AIDS patients)\n\u0002\nELDERLY WITH REACTIVATION TB\npresents with fever,\nnight sweats, or hemoptysis less often.
