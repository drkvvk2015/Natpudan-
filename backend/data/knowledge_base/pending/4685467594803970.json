Think, does the patient really need a \ncatheter? If so, use the smallest you can and take out as soon as possible.\nSize (in French gauge): 12=small; 16=large; 20=very large (eg 3-way). Material Coat-\ned latex catheters are soft and a good short-term option \ue007but unsuitable in true \nlatex allergy. Silastic (silicone) catheters may be used long term, but cost more. Sil-\nver alloy coating reduces infections. Shape Foley is typical (\ufb01 g 18.2); coud\u00e9 (elbow) \ncatheters have an angled tip to ease around prostates but are more risky; 3-way \ncatheters are used in clot or debris retention and have an extra lumen for irrigation \n\ufb02 uid, attached to the irrigation set via an extra port on the distal end (\ufb01 g 18.3). Get \nurology advice before starting irrigation. Condom catheters are often preferred by \npatients (less discomfort) even though they may leak and fall off .\nCatheter problems \u2022 Infection: ~5% develop bacteraemia (most will have bacte-\nrial colonization, antibiotics may not be required unless systemically unwell\u2014discuss \nwith microbiology). A stat dose of, eg gentamicin 80mg is sometimes given pre-\ninsertion despite a lack of evidence for bene\ufb01 t. Check your local policy. \u2022 Bladder \nspasm: May be painful\u2014try reducing the water in the balloon or an anticholinergic \ndrug, eg oxybutynin.\nPer urethram Aseptic technique required.\nIndications \u2022 Relieve urinary retention. \u2022 Monitor urine output in critically ill pa-\ntients. \u2022 Collect uncontaminated urine for diagnosis. \ue007 It is contraindicated in ure-\nthral injury (eg pelvic fracture) and acute prostatitis.\n  \n\u2022 Explain the procedure, and obtain verbal consent. Prepare a catheterization trolley: \ngloves, catheter, lidocaine jelly, cleaning solution, drape, kidney dish, gauze swabs, \ndrainage bag, 10mL water and syringe, specimen container.\n  \u2022 Lie the patient supine: women with knees \ufb02 exed and hips abducted with heels to-\ngether. Use a gloved hand to clean urethral meatus in a pubis-to-anus direction, hold-\ning the labia apart with the other hand. With uncircumcised men, retract the foreskin \nto clean the glans; use a gloved hand to hold the penis still. The hand used to hold \nthe penis or labia should not touch the catheter. Place a sterile drape with a hole in \nthe middle to help you maintain asepsis. Remember: left hand dirty, right hand clean.\n  \n\u2022 Put sterile lidocaine 1\u20132% gel on the catheter tip and \u226410mL into the urethra (\u22645mL \nif \ue033). In men, lift and gently stretch the penis upwards to eliminate any urethral \nfolds that may lead to false passage formation.\n  \n\u2022 Use steady gentle pressure to advance the catheter, rotating slightly can help it \nslide in. \ue007Never force the catheter. Tilting the penis up towards the umbilicus while \ninserting may help negotiate the prostate. Insert to the hilt; wait until urine emerg-\nes before in\ufb02 ating the balloon. Remember to check the balloon\u2019s capacity before in-\n\ufb02 ation (written on the outer end). Collect a sterile specimen and attach a drainage \nbag. Pull the catheter back so that the balloon comes to rest at the bladder neck.\n  \n\u2022 If you are having trouble getting past the prostate, try: more lubrication, a gentle \ntwisting motion; a larger catheter; or call the urologists, who may use a guidewire.\n\ue007Remember to reposition the foreskin in uncircumcised men after the catheter is \ninserted to prevent oedema of the glans and paraphimos.\nDocumentation: In the notes be sure to document the indication for catheterization, \nsize of catheter, whether insertion was diffi  cult or straightforward, any complica-\ntions, residual volume and colour of urine. It is good practice to document that the \nforeskin has been replaced. Sign with your name, date, and designation.\nSuprapubic catheterization: Sterile technique required \ue007Absolutely contraindi-\ncated unless there is a large bladder palpable or visible on ultrasound, because of the \nrisk of bowel perforation. Be wary, particularly if there is a history of abdominal or \npelvic surgery. Suprapubic catheter insertion is high risk and you should be trained \nbefore attempting it, speak to the urologists \ufb01 rst.", "text_length": 4352, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 770/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 769, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.503517", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.504821", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
