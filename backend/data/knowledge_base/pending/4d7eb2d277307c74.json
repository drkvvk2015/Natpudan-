To\ncorrect for this, should compare not the length of\nsurvival from diagnosis to death, but rather the\nage specific death rates. Alternatively, estimate\nthe lead time and take it into account\n\u0002\nLENGTH BIAS\ndisease detected by screening may\nhave a more indolent course, and thus more\nfavorable prognosis.
