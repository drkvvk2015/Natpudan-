But our integra-\ntive ethics disallow this, and ask us instead to see if acromegaly can reveal some-\nthing universal about our patients and ourselves. What is it like to feel in the grip \nof some \u2018alien puberty\u2019 or \u2018empty pregnancy\u2019? These analogies are physiological as \nwell as metaphorical.\n14,15 The changes of acromegaly are not so insidious that the \npatient thinks all is \ufb01 ne: there is often partial knowledge and a few dark thoughts \non looking into the mirror. Even when we lay our lives end-to-end for inspection \n(\ufb01 g 5.28), changes are subtle. It can take the observations of others to force us \nto come face-to-face with the truth of our new unfolding self. In one patient the \ncomment was \u2018So are you pregnant again?\u2019 \u2018Why do you ask?\u2019 \u2018Because your nose \nis as big as it was when you were last pregnant\u2019. So here we have the well-known \n\u2018physiological acromegaly of pregnancy\u2019\n14 predating the pathological, as the carni-\nval of personal identity moves from helter-skelter to roller-coaster.\nDysmorphia, personal identity, and acromegaly\n(a)\n(b)", "text_length": 2574, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 247/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 246, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.430948", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.431643", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
