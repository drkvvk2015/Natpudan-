Onset is over seconds (not instantaneous), and is often pre-\nceded by pre-syncopal symptoms, eg nausea, pallor, sweating, and narrowing of vis-\nual \ufb01 elds. Brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion, \nbut there is no tonic/clonic sequence. Urinary incontinence is uncommon, and there \nis no tongue-biting. Unconsciousness usually lasts for ~2min and recovery is rapid.\nSituation syncope Symptoms as for vasovagal syncope but with a clear precipi-\ntant: cough syncope occurs after a paroxysm of coughing; effort syncope is brought \non by exercise; there is usually a cardiac cause, eg aortic stenosis, HCM; micturition \nsyncope happens during or after urination: mostly men, at night.\nCarotid sinus syncope Hypersensitive baroreceptors cause excessive re\ufb02 ex brady-\ncardia \u00b1 vasodilation on minimal stimulation (eg head-turning, shaving).\nEpilepsy (p490) Features suggestive of this diagnosis include: attacks when asleep \nor lying down; aura; identi\ufb01 able triggers (eg TV); altered breathing; cyanosis; typical \ntonic\u2013clonic movements; incontinence of urine; tongue-biting; prolonged post-ictal \ndrowsiness, confusion, amnesia, and transient focal paralysis (Todd\u2019s palsy).\nStokes\u2013Adams attacks Transient arrhythmias (eg bradycardia due to complete \nheart block) cause \ue001cardiac output and LOC. The patient falls to the ground (often \nwith no warning except palpitations; injuries are common), and is pale, with a slow \nor absent pulse. Recovery is in seconds: the patient \ufb02 ushes, the pulse speeds up, and \nconsciousness is regained. As with vasovagal syncope, anoxic clonic jerks may occur \nin prolonged LOC. Attacks may happen several times a day and in any posture.\nOther causes Hypoglycaemia: (p214) Tremor, hunger, and perspiration herald light-\nheadedness or LOC; rare in non-diabetics. Orthostatic hypotension: Unsteadiness or \nLOC on standing from lying in those with inadequate vasomotor re\ufb02 exes: the elderly; \nautonomic neuropathy (p505); antihypertensive medication; overdiuresis; multisys-\ntem atrophy (MSA; p494). Anxiety: Hyperventilation, tremor, sweating, tachycardia, \nparaesthesiae, light-headedness, and no LOC suggest a panic attack. Drop attacks: \nSudden fall to the ground without LOC. Mostly benign and due to leg weakness but \nmay also be caused by hydrocephalus, cataplexy, or narcolepsy. Factitious black-\nouts: Pseudoseizures, M\u00fcnchausen\u2019s (p706).\nExamination Cardiovascular, neurological. Measure BP lying and standing.\nInvestigation All with recurrent syncope (or falls) need cardiac assessment\u2014ur-\ngently if associated with palpitations, arrhythmias, 3rd-degree AV block, or pro-\nlonged QT interval (p711). ECG \u00b1 24h ECG (arrhythmia, long QT, eg Romano\u2013Ward, p96); \nU&E, FBC, Mg\n2+, Ca\n2+, glucose; tilt-table test;\n3 EEG, sleep EEG; echocardiogram; CT/MRI \nbrain; ABG if practical (\ue001PaCO2 in attacks suggests hyperventilation as the cause).\n\ue007While the cause is being elucidated, advise against driving (see p158).\n3 Patient is subject to continuous ECG and BP monitoring while strapped to a table and moved rapidly from \nresting horizontal position to vertical. Induction of symptoms with inappropriate BP drop >30mmHg or \nbradycardia suggests neurally mediated syncope.
