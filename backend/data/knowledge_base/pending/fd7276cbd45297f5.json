Early initiation of androgen deprivation\ntherapy may provide disease specific survival but not\noverall survival benefit compared to starting treat\nment when patient become symptomatic, and thus\nnot recommended. With disease progression, con\nsider combined androgen blockade with anti\nandrogen (bicalutamide 50 mg PO daily, flutamide\n250 mg PO TID, nilutamide) added onto surgical/\nmedical castration long term. With progression, con\nsider anti androgen withdrawal. With further pro\ngression to castration resistant (formerly hormone\nrefractory) prostate cancer, consider palliative che\nmotherapy (docetaxel prednisone). Patients who\nwere on an LHRH agonist should remain on it to\npotentially slow disease progression. Alternative\nsystemic agents (of questionable benefit) include\nmitoxantrone, megestrol acetate 40 mg PO QID, keto\nconazole 400 mg PO TID, aminoglutethimide, predni\nsone 5 mg PO BID, and finasteride (a5 reductase\ninhibitor).
