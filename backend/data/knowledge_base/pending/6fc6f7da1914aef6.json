This technique is also used for pneumathoraces (except in traumatic or \npost-operative situations) without US guidance; for this reason it is detailed here.\nSterile procedure\n  \u2022 Identify the point for drainage. In eff usions, this should be done with US, ideally \nunder direct guidance or with a marked spot. For pneumothoraces, check the \ndrainage point from CXR/CT/examination.\n  \n\u2022 Preparation: trolley with dressing pack; 2% chlorhexidine; needles; 10mL syring-\nes; 1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage \nbottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient.\n  \n\u2022 Choose insertion site: 4\u20136th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary line\u2014the \n\u2018safe triangle\u2019 (see BOX \u2018The \u201csafe triangle\u201d for insertion\u2019 and \ufb01 g 18.7). A more pos-\nterior approach, eg the 7th space posteriorly, may be required to drain a locu-\nlated eff usion (under direct US visualization) and occasionally the 2nd intercostal \nspace in the mid-clavicular line may be used for apical pneumothoraces\u2014how-\never, both approaches tend to be less comfortable.\n  \n\u2022 Maintain sterile technique\u2014clean and place sterile drapes. Scrub for insertion.\n  \n\u2022 Prepare your underwater drain by \ufb01 lling the bottle to the marked line with ster-\nile water. Ensure this is kept sterile until you need it.\n  \u2022 In\ufb01 ltrate down to pleura with 10mL of 1% lidocaine and a 21G needle. Check that \nair/\ufb02 uid can be aspirated from the proposed insertion site; if not, do not proceed.\n  \n\u2022 Attach the Seldinger needle to the syringe containing 1\u20132mL of sterile saline. The \nneedle is bevelled and will direct the guidewire; in general advance bevel up for \npneumothoraces, bevel down for eff usions.\n  \n\u2022 Insert the needle gently, aspirating constantly. When \ufb02 uid/air is obtained in the \nsyringe, stop, note insertion depth from the markings on the Seldinger needle. \nRemove syringe, thread the guidewire through the needle. Remove the needle \nand clamp the guidewire to the sterile drapes to ensure it does not move. Using \nthe markings on the Seldinger needle, move the rubber stops on the dilators to \nthe depth noted earlier, to prevent the dilator slipping in further than intended.\n  \n\u2022 Make a nick in the skin where the wire enters, and slide the dilators over the wire \nsequentially from smallest to largest to enlarge the hole, keep gauze on hand. Slide \nthe Seldinger drain over the wire into the pleural cavity. Remove the wire and \nattach a 3-way tap to the drain, then connect to the underwater drainage bottle.\n  \n\u2022 Suture the drain in place using a drain stitch\u2014make a stitch in the skin close to the \ndrain site, tie this fairly loosely with a double knot. Then tie the suture to the drain. \nIt is usually best to be shown this before attempting it for yourself. Dress the drain, \nand ensure it is well taped down.\n  \n\u2022 Check that the drain is swinging (eff usion) or bubbling (pneumothorax) and ensure \nthe water bottle remains below the level of the patient at all times. If the drain \nneeds to be lifted above the patient, clamp it brie\ufb02 y. \ue007You should never clamp \nchest drains inserted for pneumothoraces. Clamping for pleural eff usions can con-\ntrol the rate of drainage and prevent expansion pulmonary oedema. \n  \n\u2022 Request a CXR to check the position of the drain.\nRemoval In pneumothorax: Consider when drain is no longer bubbling and CXR \nshows re-in\ufb02 ation. Give analgesia beforehand, eg morphine. Smartly withdraw dur-\ning expiration or Valsalva. There is no need to clamp the drain beforehand as reinser-\ntion is unlikely. In effusions: Generally the drain can be removed when drainage is \n<200mL/24h, but for cirrhotic hydrothoraces the chest drain is treated similarly to \nthe ascitic drain (see p764) with HAS supplementation and removal at 4\u20136 hours.", "text_length": 4454, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 774/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 773, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.511947", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.513216", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
