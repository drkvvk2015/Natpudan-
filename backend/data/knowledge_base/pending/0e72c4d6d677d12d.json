Sensory loss may be \ncon\ufb01 ned to discriminative functions, eg stereognosis and two-point discrimina-\ntion (p499). Internal capsule (p470) and corticospinal tract lesions cause con-\ntralateral hemiparesis (UMN signs). There is generalized contralateral sensory loss. \nA cranial nerve palsy (III\u2013XII) contralateral to a hemipl egia implicates the brain-\nstem on the side of the cranial nerve palsy. Lateral brainstem lesions show both \ndissociated and crossed sensory loss with pain and T\u00b0 loss on the side of the face \nipsilateral to the lesion, and contralateral arm and leg sensory loss. Cord lesions \ncausing paraparesis (both legs) or quadriparesis/tetra plegia (all limbs) are sug-\ngested by \ufb01 nding a motor and re\ufb02 ex level (power is unaff ected above the lesion, \nwith LMN signs at the level of the lesion, and UMN signs below the lesion). A sensory \nlevel is the hallmark (albeit a rather unreliable one)\u2014ie decreased sensation below \nthe level of the lesion with normal sensation above. Hemi- cord lesions cause a \nBrown-S\u00e9quard picture (p696): dorsal column loss on the side of the lesion and \ncontralateral spinothalamic loss. Dissociated sensory loss may occur, eg in cervi-\ncal cord lesions\u2014loss of \ufb01 ne touch and proprioception without loss of pain and \ntemperature (or vice versa, eg syringomyelia, p516; or cord tumours). Peripheral \nneuropathies: (p502.) Most cause distal weakness, eg foot-drop; weak hand (note: \nalthough Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome typically presents as distal weakness that as-\ncends over time, some atypical forms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome may present \nwith proximal weakness due to nerve root involvement). Sensory loss is typically \nworse distally (may involve all sensory modalities or be selective, depending on \nnerve \ufb01 bre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs \nwith trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p503); invol vement of several nerves \n(mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg in DM or vasculitis. Sensory loss from indi-\nvidual nerve lesions will follow anatomical territories (dermatomes, p454), which \nare usually more sharply de\ufb01 ned than those of root lesions.\nAlso ask\nWhat is the lesion? Are the cells diseased, dysfunctional, disconnected (after a \nstroke), or under- or overexcited (migraine; epilepsy)? Is there loss of a speci\ufb01 c type \nof nerve cell, as in MND or subacute com bined degeneration of the cord (\ue001B12, p334). \nArteriopaths get strokes, tropical travellers get wormy lesions.\nWhy? Is there a systemic disease causing the neurology? Eg atrial \ufb01 brillation \nallowing an embolus to form, which then lodges in the patient\u2019s dominant hemi-\nsphere, causing an infarct that presents with dysphasia. Do a full systems ex-\namination and always beware the irregularly irregular pulse.\nFrom \ufb01 ndings to neuroanatomy: localizing the lesions", "text_length": 3131, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 455/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 454, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.953448", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.954110", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
