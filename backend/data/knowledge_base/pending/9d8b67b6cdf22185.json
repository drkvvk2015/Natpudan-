Neck \ufb02 exion may \nproduce tingling down the spine (Lhermitte\u2019s sign, p497). NB: this does not distinguish \nbetween cord or roots (or both) involvement.\nRoot compression (radiculopathy): Pain/\u2018electrical\u2019 sensations in arms or \ufb01 ngers \nat the level of the compression (table 10.11), with numbness, dull re\ufb02 exes, LMN \nweakness, and eventual wasting of muscles innervated by the aff ected root. NB: \nUMN signs below level of the aff ected root suggests cord compression.\n\ue007Features of cord compression: Progressive symptoms (eg \ue000weak, clumsy hands; \ngait disturbance); UMN leg signs (spastic weakness, \ue000plantars); LMN arm signs (wast-\ning, hypore\ufb02 exia); incontinence, hesitancy, and urgency are late features.\nWhich nerve root is aff ected? See table 10.11.\n\ue031\ue031 MS; nerve root neuro\ufb01 broma; subacute combined degeneration of the cord (\ue001B12); \ncompression by bone or cord tumours.\nManagement \ue007Urgent MRI and specialist referral guided by red \ufb02 ag symptoms \n(see p542). Bear in mind that although these are stressed in virtually every set of \nguidelines, no two lists are alike and review of evidence suggests that the accuracy \nof these features is low. \ue007Don\u2019t make referral decisions based upon the presence \nor absence of a single feature, but use these to inform your judgement. Otherwise: \ngive analgesia (as per WHO ladder) and encourage gentle activity. Cervical collars \nmay give respite during brief periods of increased pain, but restrict mobility, so \nmay prolong symptoms: avoid where possible. If no improvement in 4\u20136 weeks \nthen MRI and consider neurosurgical referral for: interlaminar cervical epidural \ninjections, transforaminal injections or surgical decompression (via anterior ap-\nproach, eg discectomy or posterior approach, eg laminectomy\u2014\ufb01 g 10.29, or \nlaminoplasty\u2014\ufb01 g 10.30). There is no consensus or high-quality evidence to guide \nselection of approach or of patients, though interventions may be best reserved for \nthose with progressive deterioration, myelopathy causing disabling neurologic de\ufb01 -\ncits, or those at risk for deterioration (eg severe spinal cord compression on MRI).", "text_length": 3065, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 516/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 515, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.063700", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.064543", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
