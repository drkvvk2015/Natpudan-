In small bowel obstruction, vomiting \noccurs early, distension is less, and pain is higher in the abdomen; in large bowel \nobstruction, pain is more constant. The AXR plays a key role (\ufb01 g 13.28 & p728).\n2  Is there an ileus or mechanical obstruction? Ileus is functional obstruction from \n\ue001bowel motility (see BOX \u2018Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?\u2019 & p728). Bowel \nsounds are absent; pain tends to be less.\n3  Is the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated? Simple: one obstruct-\ning point and no vascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg \nsigmoid volvulus) forming a loop of grossly distended bowel at risk of perforation. \nStrangulated: blood supply is compromised and the patient is iller than you would \nexpect. There is sharper, more constant, and localized pain. Peritonism is the cardi-\nnal sign. There may be fever + \ue000WCC with other signs of mesenteric ischaemia (p620).\nCauses See table 13.12.\nTable 13.12 Causes of bowel obstruction\nCauses: small bowel\nCauses: large bowel\nRarer causes\n \u2022 Adhesions (p581)\n \u2022 Hernias (p612)\n \u2022 Colon ca (p616)\n \u2022 Constipation (p260)\n \u2022 Diverticular stricture\n \u2022 Volvulus\n \u2022 Sigmoid (see BOX \u2018Sigmoid \nvolvulus\u2019)\n \u2022 Caecal\n \u2022 Crohn\u2019s stricture\n \u2022 Gallstone ileus (p634)\n \u2022 Intussusception\n \u2022 TB (developing world)\n \u2022 Foreign body\nManagement\n  \n\u2022 General principles: Cause, site, speed of onset, and completeness of obstruction \ndetermine de\ufb01 nitive therapy: strangulation and large bowel obstruction require \nsurgery; ileus and incomplete small bowel obstruction can be managed conserva-\ntively, at least initially.\n  \n\u2022 Immediate action: \ue007\u2018Drip and suck\u2019\u2014NGT and IV \ufb02 uids to rehydrate and correct \nelectrolyte imbalance (p668). Being NBM does not give adequate rest for the bowel \nbecause it can produce up to 9L of \ufb02 uid/d. Also: analgesia, blood tests (inc. amylase, \nFBC, U&E), AXR, erect CXR, catheterize to monitor \ufb02 uid status.\n  \n\u2022 Further imaging: CT to establish the cause of obstruction (may show dilated, \ufb02 uid-\n\ufb01 lled bowel and a transition zone at the site of obstruction\u2014\ufb01 gs 13.29, 13.30). Oral \nGastrogra\ufb01 n\u00ae prior to CT can help identify level of obstruction and may have mild \ntherapeutic action against mechanical obstruction. Consider investigating the cause \nof large bowel obstruction by colonoscopy but beware risk of perforation.\n  \n\u2022 Surgery: \ue007Strangulation needs emergency surgery. Closed loop obstruction may \nbe managed with surgery or endoscopic decompression attempted. Endoscopic \nstenting may be used for obstructing large bowel malignancies either in palliation \nor as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction (p616). Small bowel obstruction \nsecondary to adhesions should rarely lead to surgery\u2014see BOX, p581.\n9 Fermentation of the intestinal contents in established obstruction causes \u2018faeculent\u2019 vomit ing.
