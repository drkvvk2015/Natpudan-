It results from inhalation of coal dust par-\nticles (1\u20133\u03bcm in diameter) over 15\u201320yrs. These are ingested by macrophages which \ndie, releasing their enzymes and causing \ufb01 brosis.\nClinical features: Asymptomatic, but coexisting chronic bronchitis is common. CXR: \nmany round opacities (1\u201310mm), especially in upper zone.\nManagement: Avoid exposure to coal dust; treat co-existing chronic bronchitis; \nclaim compensation (in the UK, via the Industrial Injuries Act).\nProgressive massive \ufb01 brosis (PMF) Due to progression of CWP, which causes pro-\ngressive dyspnoea, \ufb01 brosis, and, eventually, cor pulmonale. CXR: usually bilateral, \nupper-mid zone \ufb01 brotic masses (1\u201310cm), develop from periphery towards hilum.\nManagement: Avoid exposure to coal dust; claim compensation (as for CWP).\nCaplan\u2019s syndrome The association between rheumatoid arthritis, pneumo coniosis, \nand pulmonary rheumatoid nodules.\nSilicosis (See \ufb01 g 4.21.) Caused by inhalation of silica particles, which are very \ufb01 bro-\ngenic. A number of jobs may be associated with exposure, eg metal mining, stone \nquarrying, sandblasting, and pottery/ceramic manufacture.\nClinical features: Progressive dyspnoea, \ue000incidence of TB, CXR shows diff use miliary \nor nodular pattern in upper and mid-zones and egg-shell calci\ufb01 cation of hilar nodes. \nSpirometry: restrictive ventilatory defect.\nManagement: Avoid exposure to silica; claim compensation (as for CWP).\nAsbestosis Caused by inhalation of asbestos \ufb01 bres. Asbestos was commonly used \nin the building trade for \ufb01 re proo\ufb01 ng, pipe lagging, electrical wire insulation, and \nroo\ufb01 ng felt. Degree of asbestos exposure is related to degree of pulmonary \ufb01 brosis.\nClinical features: Similar to other \ufb01 brotic lung diseases with progressive dyspnoea, \nclubbing, and \ufb01 ne end-inspiratory crackles. Also causes pleural plaques, \ue000risk of \nbronchial adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma.\nManagement: Symptomatic. Patients are often eligible for compensation through \nthe UK Industrial Injuries Act.\nMesothelioma See p174.\nFig 4.21 PA chest radiograph showing diff use nodular opacities with a focal area of irregular soft \ntissue shadowing in the right upper zone, consistent with silicosis and developing progressive mas-\nsive \ufb01 brosis (PMF). \nImage courtesy of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Radiology Department.", "text_length": 2549, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 209/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 208, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.312240", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.319889", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
