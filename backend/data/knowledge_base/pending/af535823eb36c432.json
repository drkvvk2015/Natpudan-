MRI is used in the assessment of multi focal/bilateral disease and \npatients with cosmetic implants who are identi\ufb01 ed as high risk.\nTumour size, grade, lymph node status, ER/PR status, presence of vascular invasion \nall help assess prognosis. Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) is widely used to \npredict survival and risk of relapse, and to help select appropriate adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy. NPI = 0.2 \u2248 tumour size (cm) + histological grade + nodal status\n6\nIf treated with surgery alone, 10yr survival rates are: NPI <2.4: 95%; NPI 2.4\u20133.4: \n85%; NPI 3.4\u20134.4: 70%; NPI 4.4\u20135.4: 50%; NPI >5.4: 20%.\nPrognostic factors in breast cancer\nFibroadenoma: Usually presents <30yrs but can occur up to menopause. Benign \novergrowth of collagenous mesenchyme of one breast lobule. Firm, smooth, mobile \nlump, the \u2018breast mouse\u2019. Painless. May be multiple. \u2153 regress, \u2153 stay the same, \u2153 \nget bigger. \ue014: observation and reassurance, but if in doubt refer for USS (usually \nconclusive) \u00b1 FNA. Surgical excision if large.\nBreast cysts: Common >35yrs, esp. perimenopausal. Benign, \ufb02 uid-\ufb01 lled rounded \nlump. Not \ufb01 xed to surrounding tissue. Occasionally painful. \ue014: diagnosis con\ufb01 rmed \non aspiration (perform only if trained).\nInfective mastitis/breast abscesses: Infection of mammary duct often associat-\ned with lactation (usually Staph. aureus). Abscess presents as painful, hot swelling \nof breast segment. \ue014: antibiotics. Open incision or percutaneous drainage if abscess.\nDuct ectasia: Typically around menopause. Ducts become blocked and secre-\ntions stagnate. Present with nipple discharge (green/brown/bloody) \u00b1 nipple re-\ntraction \u00b1 lump. Refer for con\ufb01 rmation of diagnosis. Usually no \ue014 needed. Advise \nto stop smoking.\nFat necrosis: Fibrosis and calci\ufb01 cation after injury to breast tissue. Scarring re-\nsults in a \ufb01 rm lump. Refer for triple assessment.
