Worse with prolonged activity. Joints may \n\u2018gel\u2019 (brief stiff ness after rest, usually 10\u201315 minutes or so). Joints may feel unstable, \nwith a perceived lack of power due to pain. Generalized disease: \u2018Nodal OA\u2019 (typi-\ncally DIP, PIP, CMC joints, and knees in post-menopausal females). There may be joint \ntenderness, derangement and bony swelling (Heberden\u2019s at DIP and Bouchard\u2019s at \nPIP), reduced range of movement and mild synovitis. Assess eff ect of symptoms on \noccupation, family duties, hobbies, and lifestyle expectations.\nTests Plain radiographs show: Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subarticular sclerosis \nand Subchondral cysts (\ufb01 g 12.4 p541). CRP may be slightly elevated.6\nManagement Core treatments: Exercise to improve local muscle strength and \ngeneral aerobic \ufb01 tness (irrespective of age, severity, or comorbidity). Weight loss \nif overweight.7 Analgesia: Regular paracetamol \u00b1 topical NSAIDS. If ineff ective use \ncodeine or short-term oral NSAID (+PPI)\u2014see BOX. Topical capsaicin (derived from \nchillies) may help. Intra-articular steroid injections temporarily relieve pain in severe \nsym ptoms. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections (viscosupplementation) are \nnot NICE approved8 Glucosamine and chondroitin products are not recommended, \nalthough patients may try them if they wish (can be bought over the counter). Non-\npharmacological: Use a multidisciplinary approach, including physiotherapists and \noccupational therapists. Try heat or cold packs at the site of pain, walking aids, \nstretching/manipulation or TENS. Surgery: Joint replacement (hips, or knees) is the \nbest way to deal with severe OA that has a substantial impact on quality of life.\nSeptic arthritis\n\ue022Consider septic arthritis in any acutely in\ufb02 amed joint, as it can destroy a joint in \nunder 24h and has a mortaility rate up to 11%. In\ufb02 ammation may be less overt if im-\nmunocompromised (eg from medication) or if there is underlying joint disease. The \nknee is aff ected in >50% cases.\nRisk factors Pre-existing joint disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis); diabetes \nmellitus, immunosuppression, chronic renal failure, recent joint surgery, prosthetic \njoints (where infection is particularly diffi  cult to treat), IV drug abuse, age >80yrs.9 \nInvestigations Urgent joint aspiration for synovial \ufb02 uid microscopy and culture is \nthe key investigation (p541), as plain radiographs and CRP may be normal. The main \ndiff erential diagnoses are the crystal arthropathies (p548). Blood cultures are es-\nsential (prior to antibiotics).\nAsk yourself \u2018How did the organism get there?\u2019 Is there immuno suppression, or \nanother focus of infection, eg from indwelling IV lines, infected skin, or pneumonia \n(present in up to 50% of those with pneumococcal arthritis)?10\n\ue022Treatment If in doubt start empirical IV antibiotics (after aspiration) until sensi-\ntivities are known. Common causative organisms are Staph. aureus, streptococci, \nNeisseria gonococcus, and Gram \u03a9ve bacilli. Follow local guidelines for antibiotic \nchoice and contact microbiology for advice for all complex cases/immunosup-\npressed patients (eg HIV). Consider \ufb02 ucloxacillin 2g QDS IV (clindamycin if penicillin \nallergic); Vancomycin IV plus 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin, eg cefuroxime if \nMRSA risk; 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin if Gram \u03a9ve organisms suspected.11 \nFor suspected gonococcus or meningococcus, consider ceftriaxone. Antibiotics are \nrequired for a prolonged period, conventionally ~2 weeks IV, then if patient improv-\ning 2\u20134 weeks PO.12 Consider orthopaedic review for arthrocentesis, washout, and \ndebridement; \ue022always urgently refer patients with prosthetic joint involvement.", "text_length": 4191, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 552/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 551, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.126021", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.127510", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
