The normal range (refer-\nence interval) is usually that which includes 95% of a given population (given a nor-\nmal distribution, see p750). If variation is randomly distributed, 2.5% of our results \nwill be \u2018too high\u2019, and 2.5% \u2018too low\u2019 on an average day, when dealing with apparently \nnormal people. This statistical de\ufb01 nition of normality is the simplest. Other de\ufb01 ni-\ntions may be normative\u2014ie stating what an upper or lower limit should be. The \nupper end of the reference interval for plasma cholesterol may be given as 6mmol/L \nbecause this is what biochemists state to be the desired maximum. 40% of people \nin some populations will have a plasma cholesterol greater than 6mmol/L and thus \nmay be at increased risk. The WHO de\ufb01 nition of anaemia in pregnancy is an Hb of \n<110g/L, which makes 20% of mothers anaemic. This \u2018lax\u2019 criterion has the presumed \nbene\ufb01 t of triggering actions that result in fewer deaths from haemorrhage. So do \nnot just ask \u2018What is the normal range?\u2019\u2014also enquire about who set the range, for \nwhat population, and for what reason.\nWe thank Dr Petra Sulentic, our Specialist Reader, for her contribution to this chapter. \nFig 14.1 Rosalyn Yalow (1921\u20132011). Trained \nin nuclear physics, and made good use of this \nwhen she developed the radioimmunoassay \ntechnique to allow trace amounts of peptides \nto be measured in serum using antibodies. This \nrevolutionized laboratory medicine, making \nreliable assays for hormones widely available, \nand underpinned the development of endocri-\nnology. It was also employed to screen blood \nagainst a range of pathogens, and the tech-\nnique is still commonly used today. She was \nawarded the Nobel prize for her work in 1977, \nand commented to a group of children that: \n\u2018Initially, new ideas are rejected\u2026Later they \nbecome dogma, if you\u2019re right. And if you\u2019re \nreally lucky you can publish your rejections as \npart of your Nobel presentation.\u2019\nContents\nOn being normal in the society of \nnumbers 662\nThe essence of laboratory \nmedicine 663\nBiochemistry: some major disease \npatterns 664\n\ue022Lab results: act NOW 665\nFluid balance and IV \ufb02 uid therapy 666\nElectrolyte physiology and the \nkidney 668\nAcid\u2013base balance 670\nHyper- and hyponatraemia 672\nSyndrome of inappropriate ADH \nsecretion (SIADH) 673\nHyper- and hypokalaemia 674\nCalcium and phosphate \nphysiology 676\nHypercalcaemia 676\nHypocalcaemia 678\nPhosphate, magnesium, zinc,\nand selenium 679\nUrate and the kidney 680\nMetabolic bone diseases\n Osteoporosis 682\n Osteomalacia 684\n Paget\u2019s disease of bone 685\nPlasma proteins 686\nUrinary proteins 686\nPlasma enzymes 688\nHyperlipidaemia 690\nThe porphyrias 692", "text_length": 2916, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 670/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 669, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.321606", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.322237", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
