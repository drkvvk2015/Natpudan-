See p49.\n  \n\u2022 Clear sputum is probably saliva.\nSputum examination\nHyperventilation: Tachypnoea (ie >20 breaths/min) or deep (hyper pnoea, ie \ue000tidal \nvolume). Hyperpnoea is not unpleasant, unlike dyspnoea. It may cause respiratory \nalkalosis, hence paraesthesiae \u00b1 muscle spasm (\ue001Ca\n2+). The main cause is anxiety: \nassociated dizziness, chest tightness/pain, palpit ations, and panic. Rare causes: \nresponse to metabolic acidosis; brainstem lesions.\n  \n\u2022 Kussmaul respiration is deep, sighing breaths in severe metabolic acidosis \n(blowing off  CO2), eg diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal impairment.\n  \n\u2022 Neurogenic hyperventilation is produced by pontine lesions.\n  \n\u2022 The hyperventilation syndrome involves panic attacks associated with hyper-\nventilation, palpitations, dizziness, faintness, tinnitus, alarming chest pain/\ntightness, perioral and peripheral tingling (plasma \ue001Ca\n2+). Treatment: relaxation \ntechniques and breathing into a paper bag (\ue000inspired CO 2 corrects the alkalosis).\nNB: the anxious patient in A&E with hyperventilation and a respiratory alkalosis \nmay actually be presenting with an aspirin overdose (p844).\nCheyne\u2013Stokes breathing: Breaths get deeper and deeper, then shallower (\u00b1epi-\nsodic apnoea) in cycles. Causes\u2014brainstem lesions or compression (stroke, \ue000ICP). \nIf the cycle is long (eg 3min), the cause may be a long lung-to-brain circulation time \n(eg in chronic pulmonary oedema or \ue001cardiac output). It is enhanced by opioids.\nBreathing patterns\n  \n\u2022 Tachypnoea.\n  \n\u2022 Nasal \ufb02 aring.\n  \n\u2022 Tracheal tug (pulling of thyroid cartilage towards sternal notch in inspiration).\n  \n\u2022 Use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, platysma, infrahyoid).\n  \n\u2022 Intercostal, subcostal, and sternal recession.\n  \n\u2022 Pulsus paradoxus (p42).\n\ue098 Signs of respiratory distress", "text_length": 2499, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 65/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 64, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.973370", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.974568", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
