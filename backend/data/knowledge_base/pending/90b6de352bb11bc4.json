Other causes: \ue007Consider in younger pa-\ntients: sudden BP drop by \u226540mmHg (most likely to aff ect the boundary zone be-\ntween vascular beds), carotid artery dissection (spontaneous, or from neck trauma \nor \ufb01 bromuscular dysplasia), vasculitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478), venous \nsinus thrombosis (p480), anti phos pho lipid syndrome, thrombophilia (p374), Fabry \ndisease (p698), CADASIL.\n5\nDiff erentials Head injury, hypo/hyperglycaemia, subdural haemorrhage, intracranial \ntumours, hemiplegic migraine, post-ictal (Todd\u2019s palsy), CNS lymphoma, Wernicke\u2019s \nencephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cerebral ab-\nscesses, mycotic aneurysm, drug overdose (if comatose).\nModi\ufb01 able risk factors \ue000BP, smoking, DM, heart disease (valvular, ischaemic, AF), \nperipheral vascular disease, \ue000PCV, carotid bruit, combined OCP, \ue000lipids, \ue000alcohol use, \n\ue000clotting (eg \ue000plasma \ufb01 brinogen, \ue001antithrombin III, p374), \ue000homocysteine, syphilis.\nSigns Worst at onset. Pointers to bleeding (unreliable!): meningism, severe head-\nache, coma. Pointers to ischaemia: carotid bruit, AF, past TIA, IHD. Cerebral infarcts: \n(50%.) Depending on site there may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia\u2014\ninitially \ufb02 accid (\ufb02 oppy limb, falls like a dead weight when lifted), becoming spastic \n(UMN); dysphasia; homonymous hemianopia; visuo-spatial de\ufb01 cit. Brainstem in-\nfarcts: (25%.) Varied; include quadriplegia, disturbances of gaze and vision, locked-\nin syndrome (aware, but unable to respond). Lacunar infarcts: (25%). Basal ganglia, \ninternal capsule, thalamus, and pons.) Five syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure mo-\ntor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, and dysarthria/clumsy hand. Cognition/conscious-\nness are intact except in thalamic strokes.\nAcute management \ue007 Protect the airway: This avoids hypoxia/aspiration.\n  \n\u2022 Maintain homeostasis: Blood glucose: keep between 4\u201311 mmol/L. Blood pressure: \nonly treat if there is a hypertensive emergency (eg encephalopathy or aortic dissec-\ntion) or thrombolysis is considered (ideally aim for  \ue005185/110) as treating even very \nhigh BPS may impair cerebral perfusion.\n  \n\u2022 Screen swallow: \u2018Nil by mouth\u2019 until this is done (but keep hydrated).\n  \u2022 CT/MRI within 1h: Essential if: thrombolysis considered, high risk of haemorrhage \n(\ue001GCS, signs of \ue000ICP, severe headache, meningism, progressive symptoms, bleeding \ntendency or anti coagulated), or unusual presentation (eg \ufb02 uctuating consciousness, \nfever). Otherwise imaging less urgent (aim <24h). Diff usion-weighted MRI is most \nsensitive for an acute infarct, but CT helps rule out primary haemorrhage (\ufb01 g 10.15).\n  \n\u2022 Antiplatelet agents: Once haemorrhagic stroke is excluded, give aspirin 300mg \n(continue for 2 weeks, then switch to long-term antithrombotic treatment, p472).\n  \n\u2022 Thrombolysis: Consider this as soon as haemorrhage has been excluded, provided \nthe onset of symptoms was \u22644.5h ago.2 The bene\ufb01 ts of thrombolysis outweigh the \nrisks within this window, though best results are within 90min. Alteplase is the \nagent of choice and must be given by trained staff , ideally within an expert acute \nstroke team. \ue007 Always do CT 24h post-lysis to identify bleeds.\n6 CI to thrombolysis: \n\u2022 Major infarct or haemorrhage on CT. \u2022 Mild/non-disabling de\ufb01 cit. \u2022 Recent sur-\ngery, trauma, or artery or vein puncture at uncompressible site. \u2022Previous CNS \nbleed. \u2022 AVM/aneurysm. \u2022 Severe liver disease, varices, or portal hypertension. \u2022 Sei-\nzures at presentation. \u2022 Blood glucose (<3 or >22). \u2022 Stroke or serious head injury \nin last 3 months. \u2022 GI or urinary tract haemorrhage in the last 21 days. \u2022Known \nclotting disorder. \u2022 Anticoagulants or INR >1 . 7. \u2022 Platelets <100 \u2248 10\n9/L. \u2022 History of \nintracranial neoplasm. \u2022 Rapidly improving symptoms. \u2022 BP >180/105.\n  \n\u2022 Thrombectomy: Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy provides additional \nbene\ufb01 t for those with large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation.\n\ue007 Admit to an acute stroke unit: multidisciplinary care improves outcomes (p474).", "text_length": 4675, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 478/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 477, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.991956", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.992970", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
