See www.hvtn.org\nAn HIV vaccine?\n\n--- Page 418 ---\n404\nInfectious diseases\nHerpes viruses\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) (human herpesvirus 1 and 2)\nIncludes HSV1 and HSV2. HSV1 infection in \u2154 of world\u2019s population (~3.7 billion <50yrs), \nand HSV2 in ~11% (~400 million). Viruses multiply in epithelial cells of mucosal surface \nproducing vesicles or ulcers. Lifelong latent infection when virus enters sensory neu-\nrons at infection site. Can then reactivate, replicate, and infect surrounding tissue. \nDisseminated infection if impaired T-cell immunity: pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis.\nPresentation: Primary infection: subclinical or sensory nerve (tingling) prodrome, \nthen vesicles, shallow ulcers. Systemic symptoms possible: fever, malaise, lymphad-\nenopathy. Heals 8\u201312d. Reactivation: usually \ue001severe unless immunosuppressed. \nAnatomy of infection:\n  \n\u2022 Herpes labialis: cold sore lesion at lip border, predominantly HSV1.\n  \n\u2022 Genital herpes: predominantly HSV2 (see p412).\n  \n\u2022 Gingivostomatitis: fever, sore throat followed by tender oropharyngeal vesicles.\n  \n\u2022 Keratoconjunctivitis: corneal dendritic ulcers. \ue007Avoid steroids. See OHCS p416.\n  \n\u2022 Herpetic whitlow: painful vesicles on distal phalanx due to inoculation through a \nbreak in the skin.\n  \n\u2022 Herpes encephalitis: most common treatable viral encephalitis. Transfer of virus \nfrom peripheral site to brain via neuronal transmission. Prodrome: fever, malaise, \nheadache, nausea. Then encephalopathy: general/focal signs of cerebral dysfunc-\ntion including psychiatric symptoms, seizure, focal neurology (temporal involve-\nment in ~60%), memory loss. Predominantly HSV1 in immunocompetent patients.\n  \n\u2022 Secondary infection: eg HSV infection of eczematous skin\u2014eczema herpeticum.\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis. Con\ufb01 rmation required in encephalitis, keratoconjunc-\ntivits, or immunosuppression: viral PCR of CSF, swab, or vesicle scraping. Also culture, \nimmuno\ufb02 uorescence, serology.\nTreatment: Aciclovir: \ue001symptoms and viral shedding, will not prevent latent infec-\ntion. \ue007Give empirical IV aciclovir as soon as HSV encephalitis is suspected, mortality \n~70% in untreated disease (see p824).\nVaricella zoster virus (VZV) (human herpesvirus 3)\nPrimary infection transmitted by respiratory droplets. Incubation 14\u201321d. Invades \nrespiratory mucosa, replicates in lymph nodes. Disseminates via mononuclear cells \nto infect skin epithelial cells. Leads to virus containing vesicles = chicken pox. Virus \nthen remains dormant in sensory nerve roots. Reactivation is dermatomal = shingles.\nPresentation:\n  \n\u2022 Chicken pox: prodrome 1\u20132d: fever, malaise, \nheadache, abdominal pain. Then rash (\ufb01 g 9.14): \npruritic, erythematous macules\ue003vesicles, crust \nin ~48h. Infectious 1\u20132d pre-, to 5d post-rash \ndevelopment (lesions scabbed). Complications \n\ue000 in immunosuppression: encephalitis (cerebel-\nlar ataxia), VZV pneumonia, transverse myelitis, \npericarditis, purpura fulminans/DIC.\n  \n\u2022 Shingles: painful, hyperaesthetic area, then \nmacular\ue003vesicular rash in dermatomal distri-\nbution. Disseminated infection if immunosup-\npressed. Infectious until scabs appear. Chicken pox risk in non-immune contacts. \nComplications: post-herpetic neuralgia, Ramsay Hunt syndrome (p501).\nDiagnosis: Clinical diagnosis unless immunosuppressed: viral PCR, culture, immuno-\n\ufb02 uorescence.\nTreatment: Oral aciclovir/valaciclovir for uncomplicated chicken pox/shingles in \nadults, aim to give within 48h of rash. IV aciclovir if pregnant, immunosuppressed, \nsevere/disseminated disease (including ocular).\nPrevention: Vaccination: not routine in children in UK, given at aged 70 to prevent \nshingles reactivation. VZV immunoglobulin if non-immune exposure in immunosup-\npression, pregnancy, neonates. \nFig 9.14 Chicken pox (VZV).\n\u00a9 D A Warrell.", "text_length": 3801, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 412/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 411, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.880130", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.881181", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
