Furthermore, there may be direct causation through \nthe noxious insults incurred during an episode of delirium, which can lead to per-\nmanent neuronal damage.\nIn distinguishing the two conditions (not always an easy task) the presence of \ninattention, distractibility, and disorganized thinking will all point you towards \ndelirium. But the fundamental question is \u2018Has there been an acute change from \nthe patient\u2019s cognitive baseline?\u2019 Family or carer collateral reports are invalu-\nable, but may not always be available. Document cognition in all patients >65y \nadmitted to hospital (eg AMTs, p64, many admission proformas allow for this). \nThis will then allow you to compare their admission score with subsequent assess-\nments and track any improvements, deteriorations, or \ufb02 uctuations in cognition\nthroughout the admission.\nDelirium vs dementia", "text_length": 1377, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 493/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 492, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.020324", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.021749", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
