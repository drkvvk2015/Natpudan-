A diverse group of tumours of enterochromaffi  n cell (neu-\nral crest) origin, by de\ufb01 nition capable of producing 5HT. Common sites: appendix \n(45%), ileum (30%), or rectum (20%).\n22 They also occur elsewhere in the GI tract, \novary, testis, and bronchi. 80% of tumours >2cm across will metastasize (ie consider \nall as malignant). Symptoms and signs Initially few. GI tumours can cause ap-\npendicitis, intussusception, or obstruction. Hepatic metastases may cause RUQ pain. \nTumours may secrete bradykinin, tachykinin, substance P, VIP, gastrin, insulin, gluca-\ngon, ACTH (\ue018 Cushing\u2019s syndrome), parathyroid, and thyroid hormones. 10% are part \nof MEN-1 syndrome (p223); 10% occur with other neuroendocrine tumours.\nCarcinoid syndrome Occurs in ~5% and implies hepatic involvement.\nSymptoms and signs: Bronchoconstriction; paroxysmal \ufb02 ushing especially in upper \nbody (\u00b1 migrating weals); diarrhoea; CCF (tricuspid incompetence and pulmonary \nstenosis from 5HT\u2013induced \ufb01 brosis). \ue007Carcinoid crisis: See BOX \u2018Carcinoid crisis\u2019.\nTests \ue00024h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA, a 5HT metabolite; levels change \nwith drugs and diet: discuss with lab). CXR + chest/pelvis MRI/CT help locate primary \ntumours. Plasma chromogranin A (re\ufb02 ects tumour mass); \n111Indium octreotide scin-\ntigraphy (octreoscan) and positron emission tomography (p739) also have a role. \nEchocardiography and BNP (p137) can be used to investigate carcinoid heart disease. \nTreatment Carcinoid syndrome: Octreotide (somatostatin analogue) blocks \nrelease of tumour mediators and counters peripheral eff ects. Long-acting \nalternative: lanreotide. Loperamide for diarrhoea. Tumour therapy: Resection is \nthe only cure for carcinoid tumours so it is vital to \ufb01 nd the primary site. At surgery, \ntumours are an intense yellow. Procedures depend on site, eg rectal carcinoid \ntumours <1cm can be resected endoscopically. Debulking (eg enucleating), \nembolization, or radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastases can \ue001 symptoms. \nGive octreotide cover to avoid precipitating a massive carcinoid crisis.\nMedian survival 5\u20138yrs (~3yrs if metastases are present, but may be up to 20yrs; \nso beware of giving up too easily, even in metastatic disease).\nWhen a tumour outgrows its blood supply or is handled too much during sur-\ngery, mediators \ufb02 ood out. There is life-threatening vasodilation, hypotension, \ntachycardia, bronchoconstriction, and hyperglycaemia. It is treated with high-\ndose octreotide, supportive measures, and careful management of \ufb02 uid balance \n(ie a central line is needed\u2014see p775 for insertion technique).\n\ue022Carcinoid crisis", "text_length": 3093, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 279/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 278, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.522770", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.523458", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
