On the patient\u2019s \nleft, cerebral sulci are prominent and prior \nto this adverse event would have been \neven larger. The brain had shrunk within \nthe skull as a result of atherosclerosis, and \npoor perfusion, leaving large sub arachnoid \nspaces. A simple, quick rotation of the head \nis enough to tear a bridging vein, causing \nthis acute subdural haematoma.\nWe thank Prof. Peter Scally \nfor these CT images and commentary.\nFig 10.23 The blood (high atten uation, \nfusiform or biconvex collection) on the \nright side is limited anteriorly by the coro-\nnal suture and posteriorly by the lambdoid \nsuture. This is therefore an extradural \nhaem at oma. The low-attenuation CSF den-\nsity collection on the left is causing scallop-\ning of the overlying bone. It is in the typical \nlocation of an arachnoid cyst; an incidental \n\ufb01 nding of a congenital abnor mality.\nWe thank Prof. Peter Scally \nfor these CT images and commentary.", "text_length": 1074, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 491/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 490, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.015262", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.015929", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
