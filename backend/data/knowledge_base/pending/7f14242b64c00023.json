Pathogenesis: A poorly understood connec-\ntive tissue disorder most commonly attributed to repetitive microvascular trauma \nduring sexual intercourse, resulting in penile curvature and painful ere ct ile dysfunc-\ntion (in 50%; p230). Preval ence: 3\u20139%. Typical age: >40yrs. Associations: Dupuytren\u2019s \n(p698); atheroma; radical prost atectomy. \ue031\ue031 : Haemangioma.

Penile rehabilitation can help (p230).60 \nFrancois Gigot de la Peyronie, 1678\u20131747 (French surgeon)\nPott\u2019s syndrome (Spinal TB.) Rare in the West, this is usually from an extra-spinal \nsource, eg lungs. Features: Backache, and stiff ness of all back movements. Fever, \nnight sweats, and weight loss occur. Progressive bone destruction leads to vertebral \ncollapse and gibbus (sharply angled spinal curvature). Abscess formation may lead \nto cord compression, causing paraplegia, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (p466). X-\nrays: (\ufb01 g 15.15) Narrow disc spaces and vertebral osteoporosis, leading to destruc-\ntion with wedging of vertebrae. Lesions in the thoracic spine often lead to kyphosis. \nAbscess formation in the lumbar spine may track down to the psoas muscle, and \nerode through the skin. \ue057: Anti-TB drugs (p394). \nSir Percival Pott, 1714\u20131788 (British surgeon)\nPrinzmetal (variant) angin a Angina from coronary artery spasm, which may lead \nto MI, ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death. Severe chest pain occurs without \nphysical exertion. Triggers include hyperventilation, cocaine and tobacco use. ECG: ST \nelevation. \ue057: Establish the diagnosis. GTN treats angina. Use Ca\n2+-channel blockers \n(p114) and long-acting nitrates as prophylaxis.  \nMyron Prinzmetal, 1908\u20131987 (US cardiologist)\nRaynaud\u2019s syndrome This is peripheral digital ischaemia due to paroxysmal va-\nsospasm, precipitated by cold or emotion. Fingers or toes ache and change colour: \npale (ischaemia) \ue003blue (deoxygenation) \ue003red (reactive hyperaemia). It may be \nidiopathic (Raynaud\u2019s disease\u2014prevalence: 3\u201320%; \ue033:\ue032 >1:1) or have an underlying \ncause (Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon; \ufb01 g 15.16). Tests: Exclude an underlying cause (see BOX \n\u2018Conditions in which Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon may be exhibited\u2019). \ue057: Keep warm (eg \nhand warmers); stop smoking.\n4 Nifedipine 5\u201320mg/8h PO helps, as may evening prim-\nrose oil, sildena\ufb01 l, and epoprostenol (for severe attacks/digital gangrene). Relapse is \ncommon. Chemical or surgical (lumbar or digital) sympathectomy may help in those \nwith severe disease. \nAG Maurice Raynaud, 1834\u20131881 (French physician)", "text_length": 4973, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 716/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 715, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.399776", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.400926", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
