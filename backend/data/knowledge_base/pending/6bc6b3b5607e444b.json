Symptoms and \nsigns: ACS-like symptoms, heart failure symptoms, palpitations, tachycardia, soft \nS1, S4 gallop (p44).Tests: ECG: ST changes and T-wave inversion, atrial arrhythmias, \ntransient AV block, QT prolongation. Bloods: CRP, ESR, & troponin may be raised; viral \nserology and tests for other likely causes. Echo: diastolic dysfunction, regional wall \nabnormalities. Cardiac MR if clinically stable. Endomyocardial biopsy is gold stand-\nard. \ue057: Supportive. Treat the underlying cause. Treat arrhythmias and heart failure \n(p136). NSAID use is controversial. Avoid exercise as this can precipitate arrhythmias. \nPrognosis: 50% will recover within 4wks. 12\u201325% will develop DCM and severe heart \nfailure. DCM can occur years after apparent recovery.\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) A dilated, \ufb02 abby heart of unknown cause. Associa-\ntions: alcohol, \ue000BP, chemotherapeutics, haemochromatosis, viral infection, autoim-\nmune, peri- or postpartum, thyrotoxicosis, congenital (X-linked). Prevalence: 0.2%. \nPresentation: Fatigue, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, RVF, emboli, AF, VT. Signs: \n\ue000Pulse, \ue001BP, \ue000JVP, displaced and diff use apex, S3 gallop, mitral or tricuspid regurgita-\ntion (MR/TR), pleural eff usion, oedema, jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites. Tests: Blood: \nBNP (p137), \ue001Na\n+ indicates a poor prognosis. CXR: cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. \nECG: tachycardia, non-speci\ufb01 c T-wave changes, poor R-wave progression. Echo: glob-\nally dilated hypokinetic heart and low ejection fraction. Look for MR, TR, LV mural \nthrombus. \ue057: Bed rest, diuretics, \ue020-blockers, ACE-i, anticoag ul ation, biventricular pac-\ning, ICDs, LVADs, transplantation. Mortality: Variable, eg 40% in 2yrs.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) LV out\ufb02 ow tract (LVOT) obstruction from \nasymmetric septal hypertrophy. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death \nin the young. Prevalence: 0.2%. Autosomal dominant inheritance, but 50% are spo-\nradic. 70% have mutations in genes encoding \ue020-myosin, \ue025-tropomyosin, and troponin \nT. May present at any age. Ask about family history of sudden death. Symptoms and \nsigns: Sudden death may be the \ufb01 rst manifestation of HCM in many patients (VF is \namenable to implantable de\ufb01 brillators), angina, dyspnoea, palpitation, syncope, CCF. \nJerky pulse; a wave in JVP; double-apex beat; systolic thrill at lower left sternal edge; \nharsh ejection systolic murmur. Tests: \u2022 ECG: LVH; progressive T-wave inversion; deep \nQ waves (inferior + lateral leads); AF; WPW syndrome (p133); ventricular ectopics; VT. \n\u2022 Echo: asymmetrical septal hypertrophy; small LV cavity with hypercontractile pos-\nterior wall; midsystolic closure of aortic valve; systolic anterior movement of mitral \nvalve. \u2022 MRI: see \ufb01 g 3.16. \u2022 Cardiac catheterization helps assess: severity of gradient; \ncoronary artery disease or mitral regurgitation, but may provoke VT. \u2022 Electrophysi-\nological studies may be needed (eg if WPW, p133). \u2022 Exercise test \u00b1 Holter monitor \n(p125) to risk stratify. \ue057: \ue020-blockers or verapamil for symptoms (the aim is reducing \nventricular contractility). Amiodarone (p130) for arrhythmias (AF, VT). Anticoagulate \nfor paroxysmal AF or systemic emboli. Septal myomectomy (surgical or chemical \n(with alcohol) to \ue001LV out\ufb02 ow tract gradient) is reserved for those with severe symp-\ntoms. Consider implantable de\ufb01 brillator\u2014use http://www.doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html \nto assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Mortality: 5.9%/yr if <14yrs; 2.5%/yr if >14yrs. \nPoor prognostic factors: age <14yrs or syncope at presentation; family history of \nHCM/sudden death.\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy Causes: Idiopathic; amyloidosis; haemochromato-\nsis; sarcoid osis; scleroderma; L\u00f6ffl  er\u2019s eosinophilic endocarditis; endomyocardial \n\ufb01 brosis. Presentation: Is like constrictive pericarditis (p154). Features of RVF pre-\ndominate: \ue000JVP, with prominent x and y descents; hepatomegaly; oedema; ascites. \nDiagnosis: Echo, MRI, cardiac catheterization. \ue057: Treat the cause.\nCardiac myxoma (\ufb01 gs 3.49, 3.50) Rare benign cardiac tumour. Prevalence \u22645/10 000, \n\ue033:\ue032\u22482:1. Usually sporadic, but may be familial (Carney complex: cardiac and cutane-\nous myxomas, skin pigmentation, endocrinopathy, etc., p223). It may mimic infective \nendocarditis (fever, weight loss, clubbing, \ue000ESR, systemic emboli), or mitral stenosis \n(left atrial obstruction, AF). A \u2018tumour plop\u2019 may be heard, and signs may vary ac-\ncording to posture.
