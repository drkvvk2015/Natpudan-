These \naccumulate in the lymph nodes causing lymphadenopathy, but may also be found in pe-\nripheral blood or in\ufb01 ltrate organs. Lymphomas are histologically divided into Hodgkin\u2019s \nand non-Hodgkin\u2019s types. In Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma,\n7 characteristic cells with mirror-im-\nage nuclei are found, called Reed\u2013Sternberg cells (\ufb01 gs 8.58\u20138.60).\nIncidence Two peaks: young adults (HL is the commonest malignancy in 15\u201324yr olds) and \nelderly. \ue032:\ue033 \u2248 2:1. Risk factors: An aff ected sibling; EBV (p405); SLE; post-transplantation .\nSymptoms Often presents with enlarged, non-tender, \u2018rubbery\u2019 super\ufb01 cial lymph \nnodes (60\u201370% cervical, \ufb01 g 8.61, also axillary or inguinal). Node size may \ufb02 uctuate, \nand they can become matted. 25% have constitutional upset, eg fever, weight loss, \nnight sweats, pruritus, and lethargy. There may be alcohol-induced lymph node pain. \nMediastinal lymph node involvement can cause mass eff ect, eg bronchial or SVC ob-\nstruction (p528), or direct extension, eg causing pleural eff usions.\nSigns Lymphadenopathy. Also, cachexia, anaemia, spleno- or hepatomegaly.\nTests Tissue diagnosis: Lymph node excision biopsy if possible. Image-guided nee-\ndle biopsy, laparotomy, or mediastinoscopy may be needed. Bloods: FBC, \ufb01 lm, ESR, LFT, \nLDH, urate, Ca\n2+. \ue000ESR or \ue001Hb indicate a worse prognosis. LDH \ue000 as it is released during \ncell turnover. Imaging: CXR, CT/PET of thorax, abdo, and pelvis.\nStaging (Ann Arbor system.) In\ufb02 uences treatment and prognosis. Done by imaging \n\u00b1 marrow biopsy if B symptoms, or stage III\u2013IV disease.\nI   Con\ufb01 ned to single lymph node region.\nII   Involvement of two or more nodal areas on the same side of the diaphragm.\nIII   Involvement of nodes on both sides of the diaphragm.\nIV   Spread beyond the lymph nodes, eg liver or bone marrow.\nEach stage is either \u2018A\u2019\u2014no systemic symptoms other than pruritus; or \u2018B\u2019\u2014presence \nof B symptoms: weight loss >10% in last 6 months, unexplained fever >38\u00b0C, or night \nsweats (needing change of clothes). \u2018B\u2019 indicates worse disease. Localized extra-nod-\nal extension does not advance the stage, but is indicated by subscripted \u2018E\u2019, eg I-AE.\nChemoradiotherapy Radiotherapy + short courses of chemotherapy for stages \nI-A and II-A (eg with \u22643 areas involved). Longer courses of chemotherapy for II-A \nwith >3 areas involved through to IV-B. \u2018ABVD\u2019: Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomy-\ncin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine cures ~80% of patients. More intensive regimens are \nused if poor prognosis or advanced disease.\n8 In relapsed disease: high-dose chem-\notherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. \nComplications of treatment: See pp524\u20137. Radiotherapy may \ue000 risk of second \nmalignancies\u2014solid tumours (especially lung and breast, also melanoma, sarcoma, \nstomach and thyroid cancers), ischaemic heart disease, hypothyroidism, and lung \n\ufb01 brosis due to the radiation \ufb01 eld. Chemotherapy SE include myelosuppression, \nnausea, alopecia, infection. AML (p356), non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and infertility \nmay be due to both chemo- and radiotherapy\u2014see p525.\n5-year survival Depends on stage and grade (table 8.9): >95% in I-A lymphocyte-\npredomi nant disease; <40% with IV-B lymphocyte-depleted.\nEmergency presentations Infection; SVC obstruction\u2014\ue000JVP, sensation of fullness \nin the head, dyspnoea, blackouts, facial oedema (seek expert help; see p528).\n7 Thomas Hodgkin (1798\u20131866); rediscovered by Samuel Wilks (1824\u20131911) who magnanimously gave the \ndisease Hodgkin\u2019s name.\n8 Eg BEACOPP (bleomycin/etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone). \nIn IIB, III, or IV, BEACOPP gives better initial control, but 7yr event-free survival is similar: 78% vs 71%.", "text_length": 3861, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 368/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 367, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.799384", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.800192", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
