With the input of a new editor and publisher, we were able to\nsignificantly expand and update the content and substantially improve the layout, while maintaining\nthe same conciseness and practicality found in previous editions.\nUnder each topic, the sections on differential diagnoses, investigations, and treatments are designed\nfor the rapid retrieval of high yield clinical information and can be particularly useful when one is all alone\nassessing a patient at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Other sections contain many clinical pearls that are intended\nto help one to excel in patient care. We also included many comparison tables aimed at highlighting the\ndistinguishing features between various clinical entities and numerous mnemonics (marked by w). In\naddition to everyday practice, Approach to Internal Medicine can be effectively used as an examination study\nguide and teaching script.\nFor this new edition, we are very fortunate to have recruited a new associate editor, Dr. Alexander\nLeung, who brings with him a wealth of knowledge and outstanding commitment to medical education.\nWe are most grateful to our section editors and contributors for their meticulous review of each\nsubspecialty, providing expert input on the most up to date information. We would also like to take\nthis opportunity to thank Jean Claude Quintal as a resident reviewer and the Canadian Federation of\nMedical Students for its support of the previous edition. Finally, we would like to thank all previous and\ncurrent users of this manual for their support and feedback.\nWe are pleased that Springer has taken this title under its direction and has helped to improve its\nquality in preparation for international release. In addition to International System (SI) units, this edition\nalso provides US customary units [in square brackets] for quick reference. We would particularly like to\nthank Laura Walsh, senior editor, and Stacy Lazar, editorial assistant, from Springer for their expert\nguidance and support throughout this mammoth project from design to production. We would also like\nto thank Walter Pagel, director of scientific publishing at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, for believing in\nthis work and making this collaboration possible.\nWhile every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of information in this manual, the author,\neditors, and publisher are not responsible for omissions, errors, or any consequences that result from\napplication of the information contained herein.
