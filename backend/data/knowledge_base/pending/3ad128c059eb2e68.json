If in\ufb02 ammation is also present (\ue000LFT, typically \ue000ALT) = non-al-\ncoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Rule out other causes of liver disease (p284) and check \nfor associated metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension). \nProgression to cirrhosis may occur\u2014biopsy or elastography may be needed (p248). \nRisk factors for progression Older age; obesity; DM; NASH. Treatment Control risk \nfactors, including obesity (bariatic surgery helps). Address cardiovascular risk (com-\nmonest cause of death, see p93). Avoid alcohol consumption. No drug is of proven \nbene\ufb01 t, though vitamin E may improve histology in \ufb01 brosis (eg 400IU/d\u2014higher doses \nassociated with excess mortality). Follow-up Monitor for complications (NASH, cir-\nrhosis, DM). If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound \u00b1 AFP twice-yearly.\nWilson\u2019s disease/hepatolenticular degeneration\nWilson\u2019s disease is a rare (3/100 000) inherited disorder of copper excretion with excess \ndeposition in liver and CNS (eg basal ganglia). It is treatable, so screen all with cirrhosis.\nGenetics An autosomal recessive disorder of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B.\nPhysiology Total body copper content is ~125mg. Intake \u2248 3mg/day (absorbed in \nproximal small intestine). In the liver, copper is incorporated into caeruloplasmin. In \nWilson\u2019s disease, copper incorporation into caeruloplasmin in hepatocytes and ex-\ncretion into bile are impaired. Copper accumulates in liver, and later in other organs.\nSigns Children present with liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, fulmin ant liver fail-\nure); young adults often start with CNS signs: tremor; dysarthria, dys ph agia; dyski-\nnesias; dystonias; dementia; Parkinsonism; ataxia/clumsiness.\nMood: Depres sion/mania; labile emotions; \ue000\ue001libido; personality change. \ue007Ignoring \nthese may cause years of needless misery: often the doctor who is good at combin-\ning the analytical and integrative aspects will be the \ufb01 rst to make the diagnosis.\nCognition: \ue001Memory; slow to solve problems; \ue001IQ; delusions; mutism.\nKayser\u2013Fleis cher (KF) rings: Copper in iris (see 6 in following list); they are not \ninvariable.\nAlso: Haemolysis; blue lunulae (nails); arthritis; hypermobile joints; grey skin.\nTests \ue007Equivocal copper studies need expert interpretation.\n1   Urine: 24h copper excretion is high, eg >100mcg/24h (normal <40mcg).\n2   \ue000LFT: non-speci\ufb01 c (but ALT >1500 is not part of the picture).\n3   Serum copper: typically <11\u03bcmol/L.\n4   \ue001Serum caeruloplasmin: <200mg/L (<140mg/L is pathognomonic)\u2014beware \nincidental low values in protein-de\ufb01 ciency states (eg nephrotic syndrome, mal-\nabsorption).\n5   Molecular genetic testing can con\ufb01 rm the diagnosis.\n6   Slit lamp exam: KF rings: in iris/Descemet\u2019s membrane (\ufb01 g 5.42 OHCS p452).\n7  Liver biopsy: \ue000Hepatic copper (copper >250mcg/g dry weight); hepatitis; cirrhosis.\n8   MRI: degeneration in basal ganglia, fronto-temporal, cerebellar, and brainstem. \nManagement Diet: Avoid foods with high copper content (eg liver, chocolate, nuts, \nmushrooms, legumes, and shell\ufb01 sh). Check water sources (eg wells, pipes) for cop-\nper. Drugs: Lifelong penicillamine (500mg/6\u20138h PO for 1yr, mainten ance 0.75\u20131g/d). \nSES: nausea, rash, \ue001WCC, \ue001Hb, \ue001platelets, haematuria, nephrosis, lupus. Monitor FBC and \nurinary copper and protein excretion. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) If severe \nliver disease. Screen siblings: Asympto matic homozygotes need treating.\nPrognosis Pre-cirrhotic liver disease is reversible; CNS damage less so. There are \nno clear clinical prognostic indicators.
