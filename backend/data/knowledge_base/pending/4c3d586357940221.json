Do \nnot attempt to cardiovert; if necessary (ie not a physiological response to fever/\nhypovolaemia) rate control with \ue020-blockers.\n  \n\u2022 Atrial tachyarrhythmias: Rhythm arises in atria, AV node is a bystander.\n  \n\u2022 Atrial \ufb01 brillation (AF): absent P wave, irregular QRS complexes.\n  \n\u2022 Atrial \ufb02 utter: atrial rate ~260\u2013340bpm. Sawtooth baseline, due to a re-entrant \ncircuit usually in the right atrium. Ventricular rate often 150bpm (2:1 block).\n  \n\u2022 Atrial tachycardia: abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS.\n  \n\u2022 Multifocal atrial tachycardia: \u22653 P-wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes.\n  \n\u2022 Junctional tachycardia: AV node is part of the pathway. P wave either buried in QRS \ncomplex or occurring after QRS complex.\n  \n\u2022 AV nodal re-entry tachycardia.\n  \n\u2022 AV re-entry tachycardia, includes an accessory pathway, eg WPW (p133).\nManagement \ue007Be guided by patient status,6 see \ufb01 g 19.10.6\n\ue022If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion.\n  \n\u2022 Otherwise, identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly. The most impor-\ntant thing is to decide whether the rhythm is regular or not (irregular is likely AF).\n  \n\u2022 Vagal manoeuvres (carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre) transiently in-\ncrease AV block, and may unmask an underlying atrial rhythm.\n  \n\u2022 If unsuccessful, give adenosine, which causes transient AV block. It has a short half-\nlife (10\u201315s) and works by: 1 transiently slowing ventricles to show the underlying \natrial rhythm; 2 cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm.\nAdenosine: Consult BNF if on dipyridamole or has had a heart transplant. Give 6mg \nIV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline \ufb02 ush, while recording a rhythm \nstrip. If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg, then one further 12mg bolus. Warn about \nSE: transient chest tightness, dyspnoea, headache, \ufb02 ushing. Relative CI: Asthma, \n2nd/3rd-degree AV block or sinoatrial disease (unless pacemaker). Interactions: Po-\ntentiated by dipyridamole; antagonized by theophylline.\nSpeci\ufb01 cs Sinus tachycardia: Identify and treat underlying cause.\nSupraventricular tachycardia: If adenosine fails, use verapamil 2.5\u20135mg IV over \n2min. NB: NOT if on a \ue020-blocker. If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age \n<60yrs). Alternatives: atenolol 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given; \nor amiodarone. If unsuccessful, use DC cardioversion.\nAtrial \ufb01 brillation/\ufb02 utter: Manage with rate control; seek help if resistant (p130).\nAtrial tachycardia: Rare; may be due to digoxin toxicity: withdraw digoxin, consider \ndigoxin-speci\ufb01 c antibody fragments. Maintain K\n+ at 4\u20135mmol/L.\nMultifocal atrial tachycardia: Most commonly occurs in COPD. Correct hypoxia and \nhypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm.\nJunctional tachycardia: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node oc-\ncurs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junc-\ntional rhythm to sinus rhythm. If it fails or recurs, \ue020-blockers (or verapamil\u2014not \nwith \ue020-blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine). If this does not control \nsymptoms, consider radiofrequency ablation.\n\ue007Seek specialist advice if resistant junction tachycardia, or accessory pathway.\nWolff -Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (ECG p133, \ufb01 g 3.37.) Caused by congenital \naccessory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short \nPR interval and widened QRS complex due to slurred upstroke or \u2018delta wave\u2019. Two \ntypes: WPW type A (+ve \ue008 wave in V1), WPW type B (\u2013ve \ue008 wave in V1). Present with SVT \nwhich may be due to an AVRT (p126), pre-excited AF, or pre-excited atrial \ufb02 utter. Risk of \ndegeneration to VF and sudden death. \ue057: Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodar-\none.
