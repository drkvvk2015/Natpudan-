Treatment10 depends upon whether the \ndisease is uncomplicated, or severe. Features of severe disease are:\n  \n\u2022 Impaired consciousness/seizures (consider LP)\n  \n\u2022 Hb <80g/L\n  \n\u2022 AKI (oliguria <0.4mL/kg/h, creatinine>265\u03bcmol/L)\n  \n\u2022 Spontaneous bleeding/DIC\n  \n\u2022 Shock (BP <90/60) = \u2018Algid malaria\u2019\n  \n\u2022 Acidosis (pH <7.3)\n  \n\u2022 Hypoglycaemia (<2.2mmol/L)\n  \n\u2022 Haemoglobinuria\n  \n\u2022 Pulmonary oedema/ARDS\n  \n\u2022 Parasitaemia >10%.\nRemember other poor prognostic indicators: peripheral blood schizonts (see p417), \nelevated serum lactate, \ue000age.\nUncomplicated falciparum malaria:\nArtemisinin combination therapies (ACT) achieve rapid clearance of parasites by \ncombined action at diff erent stages of the parasite cycle (p417):\n1   Artemether-lumefantrine: 4 tablets at 0, 4, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60h.\n1st line in UK (including pregnant >13wks), take with high-fat food to \ue000 absorption.\n2   Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine: 4 tablets OD for 3d (if weight >60kg).\nTake >3h before and after food to prevent excessive peak levels. Possible \ue000QTC \ue018 \navoid in arrhythmia.\nOptions if ACT not available:\n  \n\u2022 Atovaquone-proguanil: 4 tablets OD for 3 days. Parasite clearance ~66% after 3d, \nGI side-eff ects in ~25%.\n  \n\u2022 Oral quinine sulphate 600mg TDS for 5\u20137d plus doxycycline 200mg OD (or clinda-\nmycin 450mg TDS if pregnant) for 7d. Parasite monitoring required. Can cause \u2018cin-\nchonism\u2019: nausea, deafness, ringing in ears.\n\ue007Resistance to ACT is emerging in Asia.\n\ue007\ue000Failure rates with antifolate drugs mean Fansidar\u00ae is no longer used.\n\ue007Chloroquine is not used in the treatment of falciparum malaria.\n\ue022Give urgent parenteral treatment. Artesunate is treatment of choice. \nMeta-analysis shows reduction in mortality of 39% (CI: 25\u201350%) compared to \nquinine, preventing 94 deaths for every 1000 adults treated.11 IV artesunate is \nstocked by many infectious disease units in the UK. It can be obtained from \ntropical disease centres in London (020 3456 7890) and Liverpool (0151 706 2000).\nArtesunate regimen (adult): 2.4mg/kg IV at 0h, 12h, 24h and then daily for up \nto 5d. Converted to a full course of ACT (see uncomplicated falciparum earlier in \ntopic) when able to tolerate oral medication. Side-eff ects: delayed haemolysis \n7\u201321d post-treatment (usually self-limiting)\u2014check Hb 14d post treatment.\nIf artesunate is not available immediately, treatment should be started with \nquinine. It is safe to overlap/combine with artensuate when it is available.\nQuinine regimen (adult): Loading dose 20mg/kg over 4h. Then 10mg/kg every \n8h for next 48h or until patient can swallow (dose every 12h if patient has renal \nfailure or hepatic dysfunction or if IV needed >48h). Convert to 600mg PO TDS to \ntotal quinine course 5\u20137d. Give with 7d oral doxycycline (clarithromycin in children/\npregnant). Side-eff ects: cinchonism (see earlier in topic), hyperinsulinaemia.\n\ue007Manage in a high dependency setting. \ue000Capillary permeability so vulnerable to pul-\nmonary oedema if over-\ufb01 lled. Lactate levels may re\ufb02 ect intravascular obstruction \nrather than circulating hypovolaemia. Monitor: blood glucose every 4h (2h if quinine \ninfusion), Hb, clotting, electrolytes, creatinine. Daily parasite counts are suffi  cient NB: \nwill \ufb02 uctuate with the life cycle of the parasite (see p417) and an increase in \ufb01 rst 36h \nof treatment may not indicate treatment failure. Given the rapid action of artesu-\nnate, exchange transfusion is no longer considered to off er any additional bene\ufb01 t.\nPregnancy: Little evidence on use/safety of artesunate. On balance of risk (preg-\nnancy loss, pulmonary oedema, maternal mortality), artesunate should be given.\nSevere P. falciparum malaria", "text_length": 3831, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 426/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 425, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.906175", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.906943", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
