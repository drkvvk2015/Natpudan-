Make sure you look at the \nresult.\n  \n\u2022 \ue007Always interpret laboratory results in the context of the patient's clinical picture.\n  \n\u2022 If a result does not \ufb01 t with the clinical picture, trust clinical judgement and repeat \nthe test. Could it be an artefact? The \u2018normal\u2019 range for a test (reference interval) \nis usually de\ufb01 ned as the interval, symmetrical about the mean, containing 95% of \nresults in a given population (p751). The more tests you run, the greater the prob-\nability of an \u2018abnormal\u2019 result of no signi\ufb01 cance (see p751).\n  \n\u2022 Laboratory staff  like to have contact with you. They are an excellent source of help \nand information for both requests and results.\n  \n\u2022 \ue007Involve the patient. Don\u2019t forget to explain to them where the test \ufb01 ts into their \noverall management plan.\nGetting the best out of the lab\u2014a laboratory decalogue\n1   Interest someone from the laboratory in your patient\u2019s problem.\n2   Fill in the request form fully.\n3   Give clinical details, not your preferred diagnosis.\n4   Ensure that the lab knows who to contact.\n5   Label specimens as well as the request form.\n6   Follow the hospital labelling routine for crossmatching.\n7   Find out when analysers run, especially batched assays.\n8   Talk with the lab before requesting an unusual test.\n9   Be thoughtful: at 16:30h the routine results are being sorted.\n10   Plot results graphically: abnormalities show sooner.\nArtefacts and pitfalls in laboratory tests\n  \n\u2022 Do not take blood samples from an arm that has IV \ufb02 uid running into it.\n  \n\u2022 Repeat any unexpected and inconsistent result before acting on it.\n  \n\u2022 For clotting time do not sample from a heparinized IV catheter.\n  \n\u2022 Serum K\n+ is overestimated if the sample is old or haemolysed (this occurs if vene-\npuncture is diffi  cult).\n  \n\u2022 If using Vacutainers, \ufb01 ll plain tubes \ufb01 rst\u2014otherwise, anticoagulant contam ination \nfrom previous tubes can cause errors.\n  \n\u2022 Total calcium results are aff ected by albumin concentration (p676).\n  \n\u2022 INR may be overestimated if citrate bottles are under\ufb01 lled.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs may cause analytic errors (eg prednisolone cross-reacts with cortisol). Be \nsuspicious if results are unexpected.\n  \n\u2022 Food may aff ect result, eg bananas raise urinary HIAA (p271).\nNormal values can have hidden historical, social, and political desiderata\u2014just like \nthe normal values novelists ascribe to their characters: \u2018Conventions and tradi-\ntions I suppose work blindly but surely for the preservation of the normal type; \nfor the extinction of proud, resolute and unusual individuals\u2026 Society must go \non, I suppose, and society can only exist if the normal, if the virtuous, and the \nslightly-deceitful \ufb02 ourish, and if the passionate, the headstrong, and the too-\ntruthful are condemned to suicide and to madness. Yes, society must go on; it \nmust breed, like rabbits. That is what we are here for \u2026 But, at any rate, there \nis always Leonora to cheer you up; I don\u2019t want to sadden you. Her husband is \nquite an economical person of so normal a \ufb01 gure that he can get quite a large \nproportion of his clothes ready-made. That is the great desideratum of life.\u2019\nOxford World's Classics, pp181\u201392\nFord Madox Ford 1915 'The Good Soldier'", "text_length": 3716, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 671/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 670, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.322642", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.323708", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
