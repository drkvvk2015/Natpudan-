The lesions are largest in the right low-\ner zone, where they can be seen to contain air-\ufb02 uid levels, typical appearance of infection in a \npneumatocele (=air cyst) or cavitating lesion. A moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax can also \nbe seen, suggesting that one of these lesions may have ruptured into the pleural cavity. The patient \nalso has a right subclavian central venous catheter for the administration of antibiotics. The diag-\nnosis in this case was that of multiple pulmonary abscesses in a patient who was an intravenous \ndrug user.\nImage courtesy of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Radiology Department.", "text_length": 873, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 179/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 178, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.213193", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.213884", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
