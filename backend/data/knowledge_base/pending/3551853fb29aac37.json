Acid\u2013base disorders needlessly confuse many people, but if a few simple \nrules are applied, then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. The key principle is \nthat primary changes in HCO3\n\u03a9 are metabolic and in CO2 respiratory. See \ufb01 g 14.2.\nA simple method\n1   Look at the pH, is there an acidosis or alkalosis?\n  \n\u2022 pH <7.35 is an acidosis; pH >7.45 is an alkalosis.\n2   Is the CO2 abnormal? (Normal range 4.7\u20136.0kPa.)\nIf so, is the change in keeping with the pH?\n  \n\u2022 CO2 is an acidic gas\u2014is CO2 raised with an acidosis, lowered with an alkalosis? \nIf so, it is in keeping with the pH and thus caused by a respiratory problem. If \nthere is no change, or an opposite one, then the change is compensatory.\n3   Is the HCO3\n\u03a9 abnormal? (Normal concentration 22\u201328mmol/L.)\nIf so, is the change in keeping with the pH?\n  \n\u2022 HCO3\n\u03a9 is alkaline\u2014is HCO3\n\u03a9 raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis? \nIf so, the problem is a metabolic one.\n4   Is the PaO2 abnormal? Interpret in the context of the FiO2.\nAn example Your patient\u2019s blood gas shows: pH 7.05, CO2 2.0kPa, HCO3\n\u03a9 8.0mmol/L. \nThere is an acidosis. The CO2 is low, and thus it is a compensatory change. The HCO3\n\u03a9 \nis low and is thus the primary change, ie a metabolic acidosis.\nThe anion gap Estimates unmeasured plasma anions (\u2018\ufb01 xed\u2019 or organic acids such \nas phosphate, ketones, and lactate\u2014hard to measure directly). It is calculated as the \ndiff erence between plasma cations (Na\n+ and K\n+) and anions (Cl\n\u03a9 and HCO3\n\u03a9). Normal \nrange: 10\u201318mmol/L. It is helpful in determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis.\nMetabolic acidosis \ue001pH, \ue001HCO3\n\u03a9\nCauses of metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap:\nDue to increased production, or reduced excretion, of \ufb01 xed/organic acids. HCO3\n\u03a9 falls \nand unmeasured anions associated with the acids accumulate.\n  \n\u2022 Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia).\n  \n\u2022 Urate (renal failure).\n  \n\u2022 Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol).\n  \n\u2022 Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol).\nCauses of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap:\nDue to loss of bicarbonate or ingestion of H\n+ ions (Cl\n\u03a9 is retained).\n  \n\u2022 Renal tubular acidosis.\n  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs (acetazolamide).\n  \n\u2022 Addison\u2019s disease.\n  \n\u2022 Pancreatic \ufb01 stula.\n  \n\u2022 Ammonium chloride ingestion.\nMetabolic alkalosis \ue000pH, \ue000HCO3\n\u03a9\n  \n\u2022 Vomiting.\n  \n\u2022 K\n+ depletion (diuretics).\n  \n\u2022 Burns.\n  \n\u2022 Ingestion of base.\nRespiratory acidosis \ue001pH, \ue000CO2\n  \n\u2022 Type 2 respiratory failure due to any lung, neuromuscular, or physical cause (p188).\n  \n\u2022 Most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Look at the PaO2. \nIt will probably be low. Is oxygen therapy required? Use controlled O2 (Venturi \nconnector) if COPD is the underlying cause, as too much oxygen may make matters \nworse (p189).\n \n\ue022Beware exhaustion in asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema, which can pre-\nsent with this picture when close to respiratory arrest. A normal or high PaCO2 is \nworrying. These patients require urgent ITU review for ventilatory support.", "text_length": 3326, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 678/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 677, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.332111", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.332931", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
