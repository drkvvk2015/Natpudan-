Other heart-phrases result from poetic extrapola-\ntions of heart/self ideas and have no physiological explanation, eg \u2018he wears his \nheart on his sleeve\u2019.\nEvidence is building that heart/self interactions exist beyond metaphor and symp-\ntomatic \u2018\ufb02 ight-or-\ufb01 ght\u2019 responses. Aff ective disorders, certain personality types, \nand traumatic life-experiences increase the risk of cardiac disease, even when life-\nstyle factors are controlled for.54\u201356 In \u2018broken heart syndrome\u2019 (Takotsubo cardio-\nmyopathy), ventricular contraction morphology changes in response to emotional \nor physical stress (\ufb01 g 3.43). It mimics a myocardial infarction in terms of clinical \nhistory, ECG changes, and troponin rises, but the prognosis and management may \nbe quite diff erent so accurate diagnosis is important.\nAs physicians, we often focus on explainable physical aspects of disease, but the \nphysical and psychosocial are inconveniently related and both should be assessed \nto determine best management. Should an IHD suff erer be off ered CBT alongside \ntheir statins? Could a grieving patient\u2019s \u2018MI\u2019 be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy? To an-\nswer these questions we must look beyond ECGs and troponin, to the \u2018heart-ache\u2019 \nof the literary and philosophical kinds.\nWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted?\nFig 3.43 (a) Left ventriculogram of a heart in diastole. (b) The same patient\u2019s heart in systole. \nThe apex is ballooning whilst the base contracts, causing ineffi  cient pumping and a risk of rup-\nture. This pattern is classic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n(a)\n(b)", "text_length": 2605, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 153/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 152, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.120148", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.121118", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
