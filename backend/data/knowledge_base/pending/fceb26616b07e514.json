Stop drinking alcohol. Eat less salt. Optimize \nweight & nutrition.33\n  \n\u2022 Treat the cause (eg if dysrhythmias; valve disease).\n  \n\u2022 Treat exacerbating factors (anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, \ue000BP).\n  \u2022 Avoid exacerbating factors, eg NSAIDS (\ufb02 uid retention) and verapamil (\u03a9ve inotrope).\n  \n\u2022 Annual \u2019\ufb02 u vaccine, one-off  pneumococcal vaccine.\n  \n\u2022 Drugs:\n1   Diuretics: Give loop diuretics to relieve symptoms, eg furosemide 40mg/24h \nPO or bumetanide 1\u20132mg/24h PO. Increase dose as necessary. SE: K\n+\ue001, renal im-\npairment. Monitor U&E and add K\n+-sparing diuretic (eg spironolactone) if K\n+ \n<3.2mmol/L, predisposition to arrhythmias, concurrent digoxin therapy, or pre-\nexisting K\n+-losing conditions. If refractory oedema, consider adding a thiazide, \neg metolazone 5\u201320mg/24h PO. Diuretics improve symptoms but studies show-\ning mortality bene\ufb01 t are lacking.\n2   ACE-i: Consider in all those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD); \nimproves symptoms and prolongs life (see p114\u20135). If cough is a problem, an \nangiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be substituted. SE: \ue000K\n+.\n3   \ue058-blockers: (eg carvedilol) \ue001mortality in heart failure\u2014bene\ufb01 t additional to \nthose of ACE-i in patients with systolic dysfunction. 38 Use with caution: \u2018start \nlow and go slow\u2019; if in doubt seek specialist advice \ufb01 rst; wait \u22652weeks between \neach dose increment. \ue020-blocker therapy in patients hospitalized with decom-\npensated heart failure is associated with lower post-discharge mortality risk \nand improved treatment rates. 39\n4   Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: Spironolactone (25mg/24h PO) \n\ue001mortality by 30% when added to conventional therapy. 40 Use in those still \nsymptomatic despite optimal therapy as listed previously, and in post-MI pa-\ntients with LVSD. Spironolactone is K\n+-sparing, but there is little risk of signi\ufb01 -\ncant hyperkalaemia, even when given with ACE-i. Nevertheless, U&E should be \nmonitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alterna-\ntive if spironolactone is not tolerated.\n5   Digoxin: Helps symptoms even in those with sinus rhythm, and should be con-\nsidered for patients with LVSD who have signs or symptoms of heart failure \nwhile receiving standard therapy, including ACE-i and \ue020-blockers, or in patients \nwith AF. Dose example: 125mcg/24h PO if sinus rhythm. Monitor U&E; maintain K\n+ \nat 4\u20135mmol/L as \ue001K\n+ risks digoxin toxicity, and vice versa. Digoxin levels: p756. \nOther inotropes are unhelpful in terms of outcome.\n6   Vasodilators: The combination of hydralazine (SE: drug-induced lupus) and \nisosorbide dinitrate should be used if intolerant of ACE-i and ARBS as it reduces \nmortality. It also reduces mortality when added to standard therapy (including \nACE-i) in black patients with heart failure. 41\nIntractable heart failure Reassess the cause. Are they taking the drugs?\u2014at maxi-\nmum dose? Switching furosemide to bumetanide (one 5mg tab\u2248200mg furos emide) \nmight help. Inpatient management may include:\n  \n\u2022 Minimal exertion; Na\n+ & \ufb02 uid restriction (1.5L/24h PO). \n  \n\u2022 Metolazone (as above) and IV furosemide (p800).\n  \n\u2022 Opiates and IV nitrates may relieve symptoms (p800).\n  \n\u2022 Weigh daily. Do frequent U&E (beware \ue001K\n+).\n  \n\u2022 Give DVT prophylaxis: heparin + TED stockings (p578).\nIn extremis: Try IV inotropes (p802; it may be diffi  cult to wean patients off  them).\nConsider: Cardiac resynchronization (p132), LV assist device (BOX \u2018Pulseless pa-\ntients\u2019), or transplantation.\nPalliative care Treat/prevent comorbidities (eg \u2019\ufb02 u vaccination). Good nutrition \n(allow alcohol!). Involve GP: continuity of care and discussion of prognosis is much \napprec i ated. 42 Dyspnoea, pain (from liver capsule stretching), nausea, constipation, \nand \ue001mood all need tackling. 43 Opiates improve pain and dyspnoea.
