Cause is often unknown. \ue057: Avoid scratching, perianal \nhygiene, avoid foods which loosen stools. Soothing ointment, mild topical corticos-\nteroid if perinanal in\ufb02 ammation (max 2wks), oral antihistamine for noctural itch.\nFissure-in-ano Painful tear in the squamous lining of the lower anal canal\u2014often, if \nchronic, with a \u2018sentinel pile\u2019 or mucosal tag at the external aspect. 90% are posterior \n(anterior ones follow parturition). \ue032>\ue033. Causes: Most are due to hard faeces. Spasm \nmay constrict the inferior rectal artery, causing ischaemia, making healing diffi  cult \nand perpetuating the problem. Rare causes (multiple \u00b1 lateral): syphilis; herpes; \ntrauma; Crohn\u2019s; anal cancer; psoriasis. Groin nodes suggest a complicating factor \n(eg immunosuppression/HIV). \ue057: 5% lidocaine ointment + GTN ointment (0.2\u20130.4%) or \ntopical diltiazem (2%) ; dietary \ufb01 bre, \ufb02 uids, stool softener, and hygiene advice. Botu-\nlinum toxin injection (2nd line) and topical diltiazem (2%) are at least as eff ective as \nGTN with fewer side-eff ects. If conservative measures fail, surgical options include \nlateral partial internal sphincterotomy. \nFistula-in-ano A track communicates between the skin and anal canal/rectum. \nBlockage of deep intramuscular gland ducts is thought to predispose to the forma-\ntion of abscesses, which discharge to form the \ufb01 stula. Goodsall\u2019s rule determines \nthe path of the \ufb01 stula track: if anterior, the track is in a straight line (radial); if poste-\nrior, the internal opening is always at the 6 o\u2019clock position, taking a tortuous course. \nCauses: perianal sepsis, abscesses (see later in topic), Crohn\u2019s disease, TB, diverticu-\nlar disease, rectal carcinoma, immunocompromise. Tests: MRI; endoanal US scan. \ue057: \nFistulot omy + excision. High \ufb01 stulae (involving continence muscles of anus) require \n\u2018seton suture\u2019 tightened over time to maintain continence; low \ufb01 stulae are \u2018laid open\u2019 \nto heal by secondary intention\u2014division of sphincters poses no risk to continence.\nAnorectal abscesses Usually caused by gut organisms (rarely staphs or TB). \ue032:\ue033\u22481:8. \nPerianal (~45%), ischiorectal (\u226430%), intersphincteric (>20%), supralevator (~5%) \n(\ufb01 g 13.43). \ue057: Incise & drain under GA. Associations: DM, Crohn\u2019s, malignancy, \ufb01 stulae.\nPerianal haematoma (AKA thrombosed external pile\u2014see p633). Strictly, it is actu-\nally a clotted venous saccule. It appears as a 2\u20134mm \u2018dark blueberry\u2019 under the skin \nat the anal margin. It may be evacuated under LA or left to resolve spontaneously.\nPilonidal sinus Obstruction of natal cleft hair follicles ~6cm above the anus. In-\ngrowing of hair excites a foreign body reaction and may cause secondary tracks to \nopen laterally \u00b1 abscesses, with foul-smelling discharge. (Barbers get these between \n\ufb01 ngers.) \ue032:\ue033\u224810:1. Obese Caucasians and those from Asia, the Middle East, and \nMediterranean at \ue000risk. \ue057: Excision of the sinus tract \u00b1 primary closure. Consider pre-\nop antibiotics. Complex tracks can be laid open and packed individually, or skin \ufb02 aps \ncan be used to cover the defect. Off er hygiene and hair removal advice.\nRectal prolapse The mucosa (partial/type 1), or all layers (complete/type 2\u2014more \ncommon), may protrude through the anus. Incontinence in 75%. It is due to a lax \nsphincter, prolonged straining, and related to chronic neurological and psychological \ndisorders. \ue057: Abdominal approach: \ufb01 x rectum to sacrum (rectopexy) \u00b1 mesh inser-\ntion \u00b1 rectosigmoidectomy. Laparoscopic rectoplexy is as eff ective as open repair. \nPerineal approach: Delorme\u2019s procedure (resect close to dentate line and suture \nmucosal boundaries), anal encirclement with a Thiersch wire.\nPerianal warts Condylomata acuminata (viral warts) are treated with podophyllo-\ntoxin or imiquimod or cryotherapy/surgical excision. Giant condylomata acuminata \nof Buschke & Loewenstein may evolve into verrucous cancers (low-grade, non-me-\ntastasizing). Condylomata lata secondary to syphilis is treated with penicillin.\nProctalgia fugax Idiopathic, intense, brief, stabbing/crampy rectal pain, often \nworse at night. The mainstay of treatment is reassurance. Inhaled salbutamol or \ntopical GTN (0.2\u20130.4%) or topical diltiazem (2%) may help. \nAnal ulcers Consider Crohn\u2019s, anal cancer, lymphogranuloma venerum, TB, syphilis.\nSkin tags Seldom cause trouble but are easily excised.", "text_length": 4625, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 638/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 637, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.275102", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.276308", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
