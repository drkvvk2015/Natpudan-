The technique for placing a cannula is best shown at \nthe bedside by an expert, but following these simple rules will signi\ufb01 cantly reduce \nthe risk of infection from the cannula.\nPreparation is key, remember the following before you start\n1   Equipment: Set up a tray with cleaning swabs, gauze, cannulae (swallow your \npride and take at least three of diff erent sizes, see table 18.1), dressings, 0.9% sa-\nline, 10mL syringe, needle-free adaptor (eg octopus with bionector), blood tubes \nif required, portable sharps bin \ue003 needlestick injuries do happen.\n2   Patient: Have them lying down, explain procedure, obtain verbal consent, place \ntourniquet around arm, rest the arm below the heart to aid venous \ufb01 lling.\n3   Site: Look for the best vein\u2014it should be palpable; some of the best veins are not \neasily visible, some of the most visible collapse on insertion. Tapping gently helps. \n\ue007Never cannulate: AV \ufb01 stulae arms, limbs with lymphoedema. \ue007Avoid: Sites \ncrossing a joint (if possible), the cephalic vein in a renal patient.\n4   Consider: EMLA\u00ae cream, cold spray, or 1% lidocaine for children or those with \nneedle phobia. EMLA\u00ae takes 45min to work, but can save you hassle later.\nInsertion care bundle\n1 Aseptic technique. 2 Hand hygiene. 3 Apron + non-sterile gloves. 4 Skin prepara-\ntion\u20142% chorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol (allow to dry for 30 seconds). Do not \nrepalpate vein after cleaning unless wearing sterile gloves. 5 Dressing\u2014sterile and \ntransparent so that insertion site can be observed.\nAfter insertion\n1 Take blood with syringe or adaptor. 2 Remove tourniquet. 3 Attach needle-free de-\nvice (if appropriate) and \ufb02 ush with 10mL 0.9% saline. 4 Apply dressing. 5 Let nursing \nstaff  know that cannula is in place and ready for use. 6 Document insertion according \nto local policy. 7 Write up appropriate \ufb02 uids or parenteral medication.\nWhen seeing your patient on the daily ward round (and to avoid being called to \nreview or replace cannulae at 6pm) do a RAID1 assessment: consider if the drip is:\nRequired\u2014can the patient manage with oral medication/\ufb02 uids?\nAppropriate\u2014should you consider a PICC, central line, long-term line, etc?\nInfected\u2014any signs of in\ufb02 ammation or infection? Remove if yes. Peripheral cannulae \nshould be replaced every 72\u201396 hours.\nDressed properly\u2014many drips are replaced early because they have \u2018fallen out\u2019, or \nare kinked from poor dressings.\nTissued or infected cannulae need replacing, either with another peripheral cannula, \nor with a longer-term access device, such as a PICC line.\nIf you fail after three attempts \ue007Shocked patients need \ufb02 uid quickly: if you \nare having trouble putting in a drip, call your senior. The following advice assumes \nthat the drip is not immediately life-saving. \ue022If it is, see BOX.\n  \n\u2022 Ask for help\u2014from colleagues or seniors\u2014do not be ashamed, everyone has to \nlearn and even senior doctors have bad days; a fresh pair of eyes can be all it takes. \nAs a house offi  cer, one of us was asked to place a drip when a very shame-faced \nconsultant had \u2018had a go\u2019 to prove he still could, and found out that he couldn\u2019t!\n  \n\u2022 Help yourself\u2014try putting the hand in warm water, using a small amount of GTN \npaste over the vein, or using ultrasound if available to help you identify the vein.\n  \n\u2022 If there is no one else to help, take a break and come back in half an hour. Veins \ncome and go, and coming back with fresh eyes can make all the diff erence.", "text_length": 3913, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 768/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 767, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.498821", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.499628", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
