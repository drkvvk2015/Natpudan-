This is because caregivers play a crucial role\ncaring for their loved ones both physically and emo\ntionally, and their well being is often one of the key\nconcerns for patients. Caregivers are at risk of devel\noping psychosocial distress themselves, given the\nphysical burden of providing care and the emotional\nburden of seeing their loved ones suffer. Moreover,\nmany patients develop delirium close to the end of\nlife, necessitating substitute decision making\nINTERVENTIONS FOR CAREGIVERS\nspecific inter\nventions may include (1) educating caregivers regard\ning signs and symptoms of dying so they can be more\nprepared, (2) supportive expressive counseling for\nfamily members during split visits, (3) family meetings\nto help update all parties involved and to define goals of\ncare, (4) bereavement counseling and support groups\nCOMMUNICATION IN THE PALLIATIVE SETTING\nPatients and their families need to have a sound under\nstanding of their disease, treatment options, and prog\nnosis to make decisions.
