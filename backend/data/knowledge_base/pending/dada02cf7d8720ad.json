Clinicians should use timely epidemiologic data to\nascertain if influenza is circulating in their communities, then either treat patients with influenza like illness\nempirically or obtain a rapid influenza test to assist with management decisions\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2005 293:8\nINVESTIGATIONS\nBASIC\n\u0002\nLABS\nCBCD, lytes, urea, Cr, AST, ALT, ALP, bilir\nubin, urinalysis\n\u0002\nMICROBIOLOGY\nnasopharyngeal swab for rapid\nassays (variable sensitivity/specificity), RT PCR\n(preferred), or DFA (Direct Fluorescent Antigen\ndetection).

In some jurisdictions, universal\nvaccination for influenza is recommended. Depending\non the match between vaccine and circulating virus,\nthe efficacy can range from 70 to 90% for a good\nmatch and 0 to 50% for poor matches\nTREATMENT\nneuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir\n75 mg PO BID \u00055 days, or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled\nBID \u00055 days) are active against influenza A and B.\nAntiviral treatment is most effective when started\nwithin 48 h of symptom onset. Treatment decreases\nthe duration of symptoms by 1 day, reduces viral\nshedding, and may reduce complications in those at\nrisk. Inhaled zanamivir is relatively contraindicated in\npatients with asthma or chronic respiratory condi\ntions. Household contacts of infected individuals\nshould be vaccinated and may be given prophylaxis\nwith oseltamivir 75 mg PO daily or zanamivir 10 mg\ninhaled daily \u000510 days. Resistance to oseltamivir is a\nproblem in some strains of influenza A, and amanta\ndine or rimantidine may have a role.
