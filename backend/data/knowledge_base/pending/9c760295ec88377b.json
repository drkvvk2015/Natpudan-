ECG: signs of LVF, \ue000ST segment, VT, and cardiogenic shock.\nTreatment \ue007Get help. Take to ICU.\nPrinciple is combined \ue025- and \ue020-adrenoreceptor blockade, but \ue025 must be started \ufb01 rst, \nas unopposed \ue020-blockade can worsen hypertension.\n  \n\u2022 Start with short-acting, IV \ue025-blocker, eg phentolamine 2\u20135mg IV. Repeat to main-\ntain safe BP.\n  \n\u2022 When BP controlled, give long-acting \ue025-blocker, eg phenoxybenzamine 10mg/24h \nPO (increase by 10mg/d as needed, up to 30mg/12h PO); SE: postural hypotension; \ndizziness; tachycardia; nasal congestion; miosis; idiosyncratic marked BP drop after \n1st dose. The idea is to \ue000 the dose until BP is controlled and there is no signi\ufb01 cant \npostural hypotension. Alternative \ue0251-selective blockers, eg doxazosin, are preferred \nin some centres, particularly if surgery is not an option, eg metastatic tumour.\n  \n\u2022 A \ue0201-blocker may also be given at this stage to control any tachycardia or myocar-\ndial ischaemia/dysrhythmias (p114).\n  \n\u2022 Surgery is usually done electively after 4\u20136wks to allow full \ue025-blockade and volume \nexpansion. When admitted for surgery the phenoxybenzamine dose is increased \nuntil signi\ufb01 cant postural hypotension occurs.", "text_length": 1600, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 845/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 844, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.643114", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.643989", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
