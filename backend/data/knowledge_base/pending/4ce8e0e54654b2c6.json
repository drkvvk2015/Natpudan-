The paper was \nregarded as a milestone in the history of clinical trials \nand set a precedent for the use of randomization in \ncontrolled trials. Before this, bed rest alone had been \nstandard treatment for patients with pulmonary TB. \nAfter the successes of penicillin, there was excitement \nin the discovery that streptomycin proved eff ective \nagainst the tubercle bacilli. Patients aged 15 to 30 with \n\u2018acute progressive bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis \nof presumably recent origin, bacteriologically proved \nand unsuitable for collapse therapy\u2019 were entered into \nthe trial. The streptomycin and bed rest group did \nbetter initially but the development of resistance was \nsoon recognized. This was a new phenomenon which \nhad not then been seen with penicillin. This led to the \nnotion that combination therapies were needed to \novercome TB drug resistance. The \u2018Edinburgh Method\u2019, \ndescribed in 1957, advocated the use of triple therapy.\nReproduced from the BMJ, volume 2, Jan 1, \u00a9 1948, with \npermission from BMJ Publishing Group", "text_length": 2196, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 168/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 167, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.173890", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.174814", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
