In the clinical \nsetting, 3 species make up 80\u201395% of isolates:\n1   Escherichia coli: part of normal colonic \ufb02 ora. Pathogenic forms can cause:\nIntestinal disease:\nEnterotoxigenic: a major cause of traveller\u2019s diarrhoea (pp428\u20139).\nEnterohaemorrhagic: diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis eg O157:H7 (p431).\nEnteropathogenic: infants in areas of poor sanitation.\nEnteroinvasive: dysentery-like syndrome.\nEnteroadherent: traveller\u2019s diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea in children/HIV.\nExtra-intestinal disease: usually patient\u2019s own \ufb02 ora that is not pathogenic in the \nintestine but causes disease elsewhere: UTI (pp296\u20137); neonatal meningitis; noso-\ncomial infection: pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis. Treat according to sensitivity: \ntrimethoprim, ampicillin, cephalosporin, cipro\ufb02 oxacin, aminoglycoside.\n2   Klebsiella pneumoniae: colonizes skin, nasopharynx, GI tract, hospitalized \npatients. Associated with antibiotic exposure, in-dwelling catheters, immuno-\nsuppression. Causes pneumonia (necrotizing disease and sepsis if immunosup-\npressed). Also UTI, nasopharyngeal in\ufb02 ammation. Treat according to sensitivity: \naminoglycoside, cephalosporin, carbapenem, quinolone.\n3   Proteus mirabilis: gut commensal. Causes UTI (pp296\u20137). Stone formation due \nto urease production: breaks down urea to produce ammonia, struvite stones \n(\u2018infection stones\u2019) then form in the presence of magnesium, calcium, and phos-\nphate (pp638\u20139).\nOther Enterobacteriaceae include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia: see enteric fever \n(p415), gastroenteritis (pp428\u201331), plague (p425).\nResistance: widespread antibiotic use has led to the development of highly virulent, \nmultiple resistant E. coli and Klebsiella species including:\n  \n\u2022 extended-spectrum \ue020-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Resistant to \npenicillins, cephalosporins, \ufb02 uoroquinolones, trimethoprim, tetracycline, with pos-\nsible extension to other antibiotic groups\n  \n\u2022 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).\nResistance requires antimicrobial stewardship (p384), surveillance, robust infection \ncontrol, research into resistance risk and transmission (p383).\nPseudomonas aeruginosa:\nFound in environment. Spread by contact/ingestion. Presentation: important cause \nof nosocomial infection. Infection if compromised tissue, eg wound, pneumonia \nwith lung disease or ventilation, UTI with catheterization. Septicaemia if immuno-\nsuppressed. Treatment: options include ceftazidime/carbapenem, aminoglycoside, \ncolistin. Combination may be needed. Impermeability of membrane and bio\ufb01 lm colo-\nnization lead to \ue000antibiotic resistance. \ue000Multidrug-resistance. \ue007Seek expert help.\nHaemophilus in\ufb02 uenzae:\nDivided into encapsulated, typeable forms (a-f); and unencapsulated, non-typeable \nforms. Upper respiratory tract carriage, transmitted by droplets. H. in\ufb02 uenzae b \n(Hib) causes meningitis, epiglottitis, otitis media, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic ar-\nthritis, and bacteraemia. Fatal in ~5%. Routine immunization in childhood and sple-\nnectomy/hyposplenism (p407). Non-typeable forms cause pneumonia and sinusitis. \nTreatment: amoxicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin.\nWhooping cough:\nBordetella pertussis. Presentation: catarrhal phase 1\u20132wk, then paroxysmal cough-\ning. \u2018Whoop\u2019 is a breath through partially closed vocal cords, seen mainly in children. \nCough is prolonged (\u2018100 day cough\u2019). Infants have \ue000complications/mortality. Diag-\nnosis: PCR nasal/throat swab. Culture sensitivity 10\u201360%. Treatment: macrolides \n\ue001infectivity, but may not alter disease course. Routine childhood vaccination. Vac-\ncination in pregnancy \ue000placental antibody transfer to protect neonate (p407).\nOther:\nBrucellosis (p424), cholera (p430), melioidosis (p414).", "text_length": 3926, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 399/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 398, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.857113", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.858571", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
