Food-borne due to toxin \nproduction in food (botulus is Latin for sausage), or wound botulism due to spore \ngermination in wound (includes IV drug use). Toxin blocks release of acetyl choline \nat neuromuscular junction causing \ufb02 accid paralysis. Presentation: Incubation up \nto 8d (usually 12\u201336h). Afebrile, descending, \ufb02 accid paralysis: diplopia, ptosis, dysar-\nthria, dysphagia, progressive paralysis of limbs, respiratory failure. Autonomic signs: \ndry mouth, \ufb01 xed/dilated pupils, urinary/cardiac/GI dysfunction. \ue007No sensory signs. \nDiagnosis: Clinical: do not delay treatment. Take samples (serum, faeces, wound \nswab) for later con\ufb01 rmation by culture/PCR. In UK contact GI Bacteria Reference Unit \n(020 8327 7887). Treatment: Get help. Admit to ITU. Botulinum antitoxin (from Public \nHealth England, Colindale 020 8200 4400), benzylpenicillin, metronidazole.\nTetanus\nCaused by anaerobic Clostridium \ntetani spores universally present in \nsoil. Enters body via a breach in skin. \nProduces a neurotoxin (tetanospas-\nmin) which disseminates via blood/\nlymphatics and interferes with neu-\nrotransmitter release causing unop-\nposed muscle contraction and spasm \n(tetanus = \u2018to stretch\u2019). ~6 cases/yr \nin England and Wales (2015). Mater-\nnal and neonatal tetanus important \ncause of preventable mortality in \nlow\u2013middle income countries. Pres-\nentation: Site of entry may be trivial/unnoticed. Incubation ~3\u201321d. Prodrome: fever, \nmalaise, headache. Trismus (lockjaw, Greek \u2018trismos\u2019 = grinding). Risus sardonicus \n= a grin-like posture of hypertonic facial muscles. Opisthotonus (\ufb01 g 9.45). Muscu-\nlar spasms induced by movement, injections, noise, then spontaneous. Dysphagia. \nAutonomic dysfunction: arrhy thmias \u00b1 \ufb02 uctuating BP. Respiratory arrest. Diagnosis: \nClinical. Detection of tetanus toxin/isolation of C. tetani. Treatment: \ue022Get help on \nITU: level of supportive care predicts outcome. Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) IM (or \nequine antitetanus serum if not available). Take blood for detection of tetanus-toxin \nand anti-tetanus antibodies \ufb01 rst. Wound debridement, metronidazole. Management \nof spasm: diazepam/lorazepam/midazolam (may need high doses IV), IV magnesium \nsulphate, baclofen (intra-thecal administration needed for penetration of blood\u2013\nbrain barrier \ue018 only with ICU ventilatory support), dantrolene, botulinum toxin-A.23 \nVaccination: Routine in UK (p407). Prophylaxis following injury: TIG if heavy contami-\nnation. If vaccination history unknown/incomplete: TIG plus dose of vaccine in a dif-\nferent site. Precautionary travel booster if >10y since last dose.\nPoliomyelitis\nA highly infectious picornavirus, transmitted via faeco\u2013oral route or contaminated \nfood/water. Replicates in intestine.

Incidence \ue001by 99% since forma-\ntion of Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. 74 cases in 2015. Remains endemic \nin Afghanistan and Pakistan (2016).12 Presentation: Incubation 7\u201310d. Flu-like pro-\ndrome in ~25%. Pre-paralytic stage: fever, \ue000HR, headache, vomiting, neck stiff ness, \ntremor, limb pain. ~1 in 200 progress to paralytic stage: LMN/bulbar signs \u00b1 respira-\ntory failure. \ue007No sensory signs. Post-polio syndrome in ~40% of survivors (up to 40y \nlater): new progressive muscle weakness, myalgia, fatigue.\nDiagnosis: Viral culture of stool (most sensitive, 2 samples >24h apart), pharyn-\ngeal swabs, blood, CSF. PCR can diff erentiate wild-type from vaccine. Paired serol-\nogy. Treatment: None. Vaccination: Salk (inactivated, IM) or Sabin (live, oral). In \npreviously endemic areas 200 million volunteers have vaccinated 3 billion children, \npreventing 1.5 million deaths in the last 20y.\nFig 9.45 Spasm causing opisthotonus (arching of \nbody with neck hyperextension). \ue031\ue031 tetanus, rabies, \ncerebral malaria, neurosyphilis, acute cerebral injury, \ncatatonia.\n\u00a9 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "text_length": 4207, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 444/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 443, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.935580", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.936544", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
