If you are wondering if you should ask: ask.\nFrequently, the skills needed for diagnosis or treatment will lie beyond the team \nyou are working for, so, during ward rounds, agree who should be asked for an \nopinion. You will be left with the job of making the arrangements, so check before \nyour senior leaves exactly what their question is. Don\u2019t be intimidated, but follow \nthese simple rules:\n  \u2022 Know the history and examination \ufb01 ndings (ideally your own), and have the pa-\ntient\u2019s notes, observations, recent test results, and drug charts to hand (table 2.2).\n  \u2022 At the outset, state if you are just looking for advice or if you are asking if the \npatient could be seen. Make it clear exactly what the question is that you want \naddressed, allowing the listener to focus their thoughts and ask relevant questions.\n  \n\u2022 Give the patient\u2019s age and run through a brief history including relevant past \nmedical history. If you would like the patient to be seen, give warning if they will \nbe leaving the ward for a test at a particular time.\n  \n\u2022 The visiting doctor may be unfamiliar with your ward. When he or she arrives \nintroduce yourself, get the notes and charts, and give your contact details in case \nthey have further questions.\nTable 2.2 Referring for a specialist opinion\nTeam\nKey questions\nAnaesthetics\nPrevious anaesthetic?
