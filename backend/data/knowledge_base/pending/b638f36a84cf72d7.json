For example, if the \nQRS is isoelectric in lead II \n(+60\u00b0), the axis is either:\n+60\u00b0 \u03a9 90\u00b0 = \u03a930\u00b0, or\n+60\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = +150\u00b0.\nIf the QRS is more positive \nthan negative in lead I (0\u00b0) \nthen the axis must be \u03a930\u00b0, \nand vice versa.\nIn practice, the exact axis matters little; what you need to be able to recognize is \nwhether the axis is normal (\u03a930\u00b0 to +90\u00b0), left-deviated (<\u03a930\u00b0), or right deviated \n(>+90\u00b0). There are many ways of doing this. If the QRS in lead I (0\u00b0) is predomi-\nnantly positive (the R wave is taller than the S wave is deep), the axis must be be-\ntween \u03a990\u00b0 and +90\u00b0. If lead II (+60\u00b0) is mostly positive, the axis must be between \n\u03a930\u00b0 and +150\u00b0. So if both I and II are positive, the axis must be between \u03a930\u00b0 and \n+90\u00b0\u2014the normal range. When II is negative, the axis is likely to be left-deviated \n(<\u03a930\u00b0) and when I is negative, the axis is likely to be right-deviated (>+90\u00b0).
