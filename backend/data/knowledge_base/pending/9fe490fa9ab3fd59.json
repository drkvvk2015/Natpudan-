Tension \nheadaches are the most common, but beware the disabling and treatable (migraine, \ncluster headache), and the sinister (space-occupying lesions, meningitis, subarach-\nnoid haemorrhage). A good history is the key. Ask about:\nOnset Rapid onset headaches are concerning; the key diagnosis to rule out here \nis \u2022subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH, p478), sudden-onset, \u2018worst ever\u2019 headache, \noften occipital, stiff  neck, focal signs, \ue001consciousness. Other diff erentials include: \n\u2022Meningitis (p822): fever, photophobia, stiff  neck, purpuric rash, coma. May be \nassociated with neck stiff ness (\u2248 meningeal irritation). Do an LP, start antibiotics. \n\u2022Encephalitis (p824): fever, odd behaviour, \ufb01 ts, or reduced consciousness. Do an \nurgent CT head and LP to look for signs of infection. \u2022Post-coital headache.\nSubacute/gradual onset headaches: \u2022Venous sinus thrombosis (p480): subacute \nheadache, papilloedema. \u2022Sinusitis: dull, constant ache over frontal or maxillary si-\nnuses, with tenderness \u00b1 postnasal drip. Pain is worse on bending over. Ethmoid or \nsphenoid sinus pain is felt deep in the midline at the root of the nose. Common with \ncoryza (p406). The pain lasts ~1\u20132 wks. CT can con\ufb01 rm diagnosis but is rarely needed. \n\u2022Tropical illness: eg malaria: travel history, \ufb02 u-like illness (p416); typhus (p415). \u2022In-\ntracranial hypotension: CSF leakage, eg iatrogenic after LP or epidural anaesthesia. \nSuspect if headaches worse on standing.; treat with epidural blood patch over leak, \nif conservative management with IV \ufb02 uids and caff eine fails.\nCharacter Tight band? Think tension headache (the usual cause of bilateral, non-\npulsatile headache \u00b1 scalp muscle tenderness). Throbbing/pulsatile/lateralizing? \nThink migraine (p458).\nFrequency Headaches that recur tend to be benign: \u2022 Migraine: p458. \u2022 Cluster \nheadache: (see BOX \u2018Cluster headache\u2019) \u2022 Trigeminal neuralgia: (see BOX \u2018Trigemi-\nnal neuralgia\u2019) \u2022 Recurrent (Moll aret\u2019s) meningitis: suspect if fever/meningism \nwith each headache. Send CSF for herpes simplex PCR (HSV2). Is there access to \nsubarachnoid spaces via a skull fracture, or a recurring cause of aseptic meningitis \n(SLE, eg abducens nerve palsy, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s, sarcoid)?\nDuration Chronic, progressive headaches can indicate \ue000 ICP. Typically worse on \nwaking, lying, bending forward, or coughing. Also: vomiting, papilloedema, sei-\nzures, false localizing signs, or odd behaviour. Do imaging to exclude a space-\noccupying lesion, and consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. \ue007LP is \ncontraindicated until after imaging.\nAssociated features Eye pain \u00b1 reduced vision: Think acute glaucoma. Typically \nelderly, long-sighted people. Constant pain develops rapidly around one eye, radiat-\ning to the forehead with markedly reduced vision, visual haloes, and a red, congested \neye (p561). \ue007Seek expert help at once. If delay in treatment of >1h is likely, give eye \ndrops (eg 0.5% timolol maleate \u00b1 2% pilocarpine) and acetazolamide 500mg PO. Jaw \nclaudication tender with thickened, pulseless temporal arteries: Giant cell arteritis: \n(p556) Subacute-onset headache with ESR >40mm/h. \ue007Exclude in all >50yrs old with a \nheadache that has lasted a few weeks: prompt diagnosis and steroids avoid blindness.\nPrecipitating causes Head trauma: Commonly causes localized pain but can be \nmore generalized. It lasts ~2wks; often resistant to analgesia. Do CT to exclude \nsubdural or extradural haemorrhage if drowsiness \u00b1 lucid interval, or focal signs \n(p482). Also ask about: Analgesia, sex, food (eg chocolate, cheese, coff ee).\nRed \ufb02 ags See p780.\nDrug history Exclude medication overuse (analgesic rebound) headache: Culprits \nare mixed analgesics (paracetamol + codeine/opiates), ergotamine, and triptans. This \nis a common reason for episodic headache becoming chronic daily headache. Anal-\ngesia must be withdrawn\u2014aspirin or naproxen may mollify the rebound headache. \nA preventive may help once off  other drugs (eg tricyclics, valproate,  gabapentin; \np504). Limit use of over-the-counter analgesia (no more than 6d per month).\nSocial history Ask about stress or recent life events; may not explain the pathol-\nogy, but will help you appreciate the context in which symptoms are experienced.", "text_length": 4393, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 464/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 463, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.969558", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.970542", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
