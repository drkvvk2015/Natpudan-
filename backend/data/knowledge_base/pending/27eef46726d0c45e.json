Takes 6\u201310wks to work. 30% will \ndevelop SES requiring treatment cessation including abdominal pain, nausea, pancre-\natitis, leucopenia, abnormal LFTS. Monitor FBC, U&E, LFT weekly for 4wks, then every \n4wks for 3 months, then at least 3-monthly. Alternative immunomodulators include \n6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (CI: \ue033 of reproductive age).\n5-ASA Unlike in UC, have no role in the management of Crohn\u2019s.\nBiologics Anti-TNF\ue025: TNF\ue025 plays an important role in pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease, \ntherefore monoclonal antibodies to TNF\ue025, eg in\ufb02 iximab and adalimumab, can \ue001disease \nactivity. They counter neutrophil accumulation and granuloma formation and cause \ncytotoxicity to CD4+ T cells, thus clearing cells driving the immune response. These \ndrugs play a vital role in both induction and maintenance therapy. CI: sepsis, active/\nlatent TB, \ue000LFT >3-fold above top end of normal. SE: rash. Avoid in people with known un-\nderlying malignancy. TB may reactivate when on in\ufb02 iximab, so screen patients before \nstarting the treatment (CXR, PPD, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)). Combined \nAZA and in\ufb02 iximab can \ue000 effi  cacy of \ue014 at 12 months, but there are long-term safety \nissues (eg increased lymphoma risk). Anti-integrin: Monoclonal antibodies targeting \nadhesion molecules involved in gut lymphocyte traffi  cking, eg vedolizumab, reduce \ndisease activity and have a more gut-speci\ufb01 c mechanism of activiy. Anti-IL12/23: Rep-\nresents a new cytokine target with an emerging role in treatment, eg ustekinumab.\nNutrition Enteral is preferred (eg polymeric diet); consider TPN as a last resort. \nElemental diets: (Eg E028\u00ae.) Contain amino acids and can give remission. Low \nresidue diets: Help symptoms in those with active disease or strictures.\nSurgery 50\u201380% need \u22651 operation in their life. It never cures. Indications: drug \nfailure (most common); GI obstruction from stricture; perforation; \ufb01 stulae; ab-\nscess. Surgical aims are: 1 resection of aff ected areas\u2014but beware short bowel \nsyndrome (p580) 2 to control perianal or \ufb01 stulizing disease 3 defunction (rest) \ndistal disease eg with a temporary ileostomy.
