It is based on the GALS locomotor screen \n(Gait, Arms, Legs, Spine). 1\nEssence \u2018Look, feel, and move\u2019 (active and passive). If a joint looks normal to you, \nfeels normal to the patient, and has full range of movement, it usu ally is normal. \nMake sure the patient is comfortable, and obtain their consent before examination. \nThe GALS screening examination should be done in light underwear.\nSpine: Observe from behind: is muscle bulk normal (buttocks, shoulders)? Is the \nspine straight? Are paraspinal muscles symmetrical? Any swellings/deformities? \nObserve from the side: is cervical and lumbar lordosis normal? Any kyphosis? \n\u2018Touch your toes, please\u2019: is lumbar spine \ufb02 exion normal, eg Schober\u2019s test?\n1 Observe \nfrom in front: \u2018Tilt your head\u2019 (without moving the shoulders)\u2014tests lateral neck \n\ufb02 exion. Palpate for typical \ufb01 bromyalgia tender points (see p558).\nArms: \u2018Try putting your hands behind your head\u2019\u2014tests functional shoulder move-\nment. \u2018Arms out straight\u2019\u2014tests elbow extension and forearm supination/prona-\ntion. Examine the hands: any deformity (\ufb01 g 12.2), wasting, or swellings? Squeeze \nacross 2nd\u20135th metacarpophalangeal joints. Pain may denote joint or tendon syno-\nvitis. \u2018Put your index \ufb01 nger on your thumb\u2019\u2014tests pincer grip. Assess dexterity, eg \nfastening a button or picking up a coin.\nLegs: Observe legs: normal quadriceps bulk? Any swelling or deformity? With pa-\ntient lying supine: any leg length discrepancy? Internally/externally rotate each hip \nin \ufb02 exion. Passively \ufb02 ex knee and hip to the full extent. Is movement limited? Any \ncrepitus? Find any knee effusion using the patella tap test. If there is \ufb02 uid, consider \naspirating and testing for crystals or infection. With patient standing: observe feet: \nany deformity? Are arches high or \ufb02 at? Any callosities? These may indicate an ab-\nnormal gait of some chronicity. Squeeze across metatarsophalangeal joints: see as \nfor arms. Also: although not in the GALS system, palpate the heel and Achilles tendon \nto identify plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis often associated with seronega-\ntive rheumatological conditions. Examine the patient\u2019s shoes for signs of uneven wear.\nGait: Observe walking: is the gait smooth? Good arm swing? Stride length OK? Nor-\nmal heel strike and toe off ? Can they turn quickly?\nRange of joint movement Is noted in degrees, with anatomical position being the \nneutral position\u2014eg elbow \ufb02 exion 0\u00b0\u2013150\u00b0 normally, but with \ufb01 xed \ufb02 exion and lim-\nited movement, range may be reduced to 30\u00b0\u201390\u00b0. A valgus deformity deviates later-\nally (away from the mid-line, \ufb01 g 12.3); a varus deformity points towards the mid-line.\nFig 12.3 Bilateral hallux valgus.\nReproduced from British Medical Journal, \u2018Hallux valgus\u2019, \nR Choa, R Sharp, K R Mahtani, 2010, with permission from \nBMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n1 Schober\u2019s test: make a mark on the lumbar spine at the level of the posterior iliac spine. Measure out \na line from 5cm below to 10cm above the mark. Ask to bend forward as far as they can. If the line does \nnot lengthen by at least 5cm in \ufb02 exion, there is reduced lumbar \ufb02 exion, eg in ankylosing spondylitis.\nFig 12.2 Swan-neck deformity.\nReproduced from Watts et al., Oxford Textbook of \nRheumatology, 2013, with permission from Oxford \nUniversity Press.", "text_length": 3532, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 548/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 547, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.117866", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.119972", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
