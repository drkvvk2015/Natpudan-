Worse at rest; often \u2018pill-rolling\u2019 of thumb over \ufb01 ngers \n(see p468).\n2   Hypertonia. Rigidity + tremor gives \u2018cogwheel rigidity\u2019, felt by \nthe examiner during rapid pronation/supination.\n3   Bradykinesia. Slow to initiate movement; actions slow and de-\ncrease in amplitude with repetition, eg \ue001 blink rate, micrographia. \nGait is festinant (shuffl  ing, pitched forward, \ufb01 g 10.25) with \ue001 arm-\nswing and freezing at obstacles or doors (due to poor simulta-\nneous motor and cognitive function). Expressionless face.\nCauses\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD): Loss of dopaminergic neurons \nin the substantia nigra, associated with Lewy bodies in the basal ganglia, brain-\nstem, and cortex. Most cases are sporadic, though multiple genetic loci have been \nidenti\ufb01 ed in familial cases. Mean age at onset is 60yrs. Prevalence: \ue000 with age: 3.5% \nat 85\u201389yrs. Clinical features: The parkinsonian triad, plus non-motor symptoms \nsuch as: autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension, constipation, urinary fre-\nquency/urgency, dribbling of saliva), sleep disturbance, and reduced sense of smell. \nNeuropsychiatric complications, such as depression, dementia, and psychosis, are \ncommon and debilitating. Diagnosis: Is clinical and based on the core features of \nbradykinesia with resting tremor and/or hypertonia; cerebellar disease and fronto-\ntemporal dementia should be excluded; a clinical response to dopaminergic therapy \nis supportive. \ue007Signs are invariably worse on one side\u2014if symmetrical look for other \ncauses. If an alternative cause is suspected then consider MRI to rule out structural \npathology. Functional neuroimaging (DaTscan\u2122, PET) is playing an emerging role. \nTreatment: Focuses on symptom control and does not slow disease progression \n(see BOX). Non-pharmacological options include deep brain stimulation (DBS, may help \nthose who are partly dopamine-responsive) and surgical ablation of overactive basal \nganglia circuits (eg subthalamic nuclei).\nParkinson\u2019s plus syndromes Pro gressive supranuclear palsy: (PSP, Steele\u2013Rich-\nardson\u2013Olszewski syndrome.) Early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy \u00b1 falls; \nrigidity of trunk  >limbs; symmetrical onset; speech and swallowing problems; little \ntremor. Multiple system atrophy: (MSA; Shy\u2013Drager.) Early autonomic features, eg \nimpotence/incontinence, postural \ue001BP; cerebellar + pyr amidal signs; rigidity > tremor. \nCortico-basal degeneration: (CBD.) Akinetic rigidity involving one limb; cortical \nsensory loss (eg astereognosis); apraxia (even autonomous interfering activity by \naff ected limb\u2014the \u2018alien limb\u2019 phenomenon). Lewy body dementia: See p486.\nSecondary causes Vascular parkinsonism: (2.5\u20135% of parkinsonism, also called \n\u2018lower limb\u2019 parkinsonism). Eg diabetic/hypertensive patient with postural instabil-\nity and falls (rather than tremor, bradykinesia, and festination). Other secondary \ncauses: Drugs (neuroleptics, metoclopramide, prochlor pera zine), toxins (manganese), \nWilson\u2019s disease (p285), trauma (dementia pugilistica), encephalitis, neurosyphilis.\nManagement Requires input of a a multidis ciplinary team (GP, neurologist, nurse \nspecialist, social worker, carers, physio- and occupational therapist) to boost quality \nof life. Assess disability and cognition objectively and reg ularly, and monitor mood\u2014\ndepression is common. Involve palliative care services early on. Postural exercises \nand weight lifting may help. \ue007Don\u2019t forget the carers (p487): off er respite care. \nFig 10.25 \u2018Marche \u00e0 petit pas.\u2019", "text_length": 3641, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 502/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 501, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.037418", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.038104", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
