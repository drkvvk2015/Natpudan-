Not all centre on nodes (extranodal tissues generating lymphoma include muco-\nsa-associated lymphoid tissue, eg gastric MALT, later in topic). Incidence has doubled \nsince 1970 (to 2: 10 000). Causes Immunode\ufb01 ciency\u2014drugs; HIV (usually high-grade \nlymphoma from EBV transformed cells, p405); HTLV-1, p405; H. pylori; toxins; congenital.\nSigns and symptoms \u2022 Super\ufb01 cial lymphadenopathy (75% at presentation).\n  \n\u2022 Extranodal disease (50%) Gut (commonest): 1 Gastric MALT is caused by H. pylori, \nand may regress with its eradication (p252). Symptoms: as for gastric Ca (p619), \nwith systemic features (see below). MALT usually involves the antrum, is multifocal, \nand metastasizes late. 2 Non-MALT gastric lymphomas (60%) are usually diff use \nlarge-cell B lymphomas\u2014high-grade and not responding well to H. pylori eradi-\ncation. 3 Small-bowel lymphomas eg IPSID (immunoproliferative small intestine \ndisease p370), or EATCL (enteropathy/coeliac-associated intra-epithelial T-cell lym-\nphoma)\u2014presents with diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and \ue001weight. Poor \nprognosis. Skin: (2nd commonest\u2014see \ufb01 g 8.62) Eg clonal T cells in mycosis fungoi-\ndes (accounts for ~50%\u2014p596). Oropharynx: Waldeyer\u2019s ring lymphoma causes \nsore throat/obstructed breathing. Other possible sites: Bone, CNS, and lung.\n  \n\u2022 Systemic features\u2014fever, night sweats, weight loss (less common than in Hodg-\nkin\u2019s lymphoma, and indicates disseminated disease).\n  \n\u2022 Pancytopenia from marrow involvement\u2014anaemia, infection, bleeding (\ue001platelets).\nTests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT. \ue000LDH \u2248 worse prognosis, re\ufb02 ecting \ue000cell turnover. Marrow \nand node biopsy for classi\ufb01 cation (complex, based on the WHO system of high- or \nlow-grade). Staging: Ann Arbor system (p360)\u2014CT \u00b1 PET of chest, abdomen, pelvis. \nSend cytology of any eff usion; LP for CSF cytology if CNS signs.\nDiagnosis/management is multidisciplinary, synthesizing details from clinical \nevaluation, histology, immunology, molecular genetics, and imaging. Generally:\n  \n\u2022 Low-grade lymphomas are indolent, often incurable and widely disseminated. In-\nclude: follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma/MALT, lymphocytic lympho-\nma (closely related to CLL and treated similarly), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma \n(produces IgM = Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinaemia, p370). See \ufb01 g 8.63.\n  \u2022 High-grade lymphomas are more aggressive, but often curable. There is often \nrapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms. Include: Burkitt\u2019s \nlymphoma (childhood disease with characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy; \ufb01 gs 8.64, \n8.65), lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL), diff use large B-cell lymphoma.\nTreatment Huge range of options, depending on disease subtype. Low grade: \nIf symptomless, none may be needed. Radiotherapy may be curative in localized \ndisease. Chlorambucil is used in diff use disease. Remission may be maintained by \nusing interferon alfa or rituximab (see later in paragraph). Bendamustine is eff ec-\ntive both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients. \nHigh grade: (eg large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), \u2018R-CHOP\u2019 regimen: Rituximab, Cy-\nclophosphamide, Hydroxy daunorubicin, vincristine (Oncovin\u00ae) and Prednisolone. \nGranulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) help neutropenia\u2014eg \ufb01 lgrastim or \nlenograstim (at low doses it may be cost-eff ective).\nSurvival Histology is important. Prognosis is worse if, at presentation: \u2022 Age >60yrs. \n\u2022 Systemic symptoms. \u2022 Bulky disease (abdominal mass >10cm). \u2022 \ue000LDH. \u2022 Dissem-\ninated disease. Typical 5yr survival for treated patients: ~30% for high-grade and \n>50% for low-grade lymphomas, but the picture is very variable.", "text_length": 3917, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 370/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 369, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.804233", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.805166", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
