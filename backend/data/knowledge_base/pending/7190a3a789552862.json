Keep practising. Be aware \nthat books present ideal situations: often one or more signs are equivocal or even \ncontrary to expectation; consider signs in the context of the history and try re-ex-\namining the patient, as signs may evolve over time. The only essential point is to \ndistinguish whether weakness is upper (UMN) or lower (LMN) motor neuron (p446).\nPosition the patient comfortably, sitting up at 45\u00b0 and with arms exposed. The order \nof examination should be Inspection, Tone, Power, Re\ufb02 exes, Coordination, Sensation \n(\ufb01 g 2.31). \n3 Power\nDirect patient to adopt each position and follow \ncommands while you as the examiner stabilize the \njoint above and resist movements as appropriate \nto grade power (see BOX \u2018Muscle weakness grading\u2019 \non p446). Test each muscle group bilaterally before \nmoving on to the next position.
