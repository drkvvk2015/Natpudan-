Clots break \noff  and pass through the veins and the right side of the heart before lodging in \nthe pulmonary circulation. Rare causes: RV thrombus (post-MI); septic emboli (right-\nsided endocarditis); fat, air, or amniotic \ufb02 uid embolism; neoplastic cells; parasites.\nRisk factors\n  \n\u2022 Recent surgery, especially abdominal/pelvic or hip/knee replacement.\n  \n\u2022 Thrombophilia, eg antiphospholipid syndrome (p374).\n  \n\u2022 Leg fracture.\n  \n\u2022 Prolonged bed rest/reduced mobility.\n  \n\u2022 Malignancy.\n  \n\u2022 Pregnancy/postpartum; combined contraceptive pill; HRT (lower risk).\n  \n\u2022 Previous PE.\nClinical features Small emboli may be asymptomatic, whereas large emboli are \noften fatal. Symptoms: Acute breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis; diz-\nziness; syncope. Ask about risk factors, past history or family history of thromboem-\nbolism. Signs: Pyrexia; cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; hypotension; raised JVP; \npleural rub; pleural eff usion. Look for signs of a cause, eg deep vein thrombosis.\nTests\n  \n\u2022 FBC, U&E, baseline clotting, D-dimers (BOX).\n  \n\u2022 ABG may show \ue001PaO2 and \ue001PaCO2.\n  \n\u2022 Imaging: CXR may be normal, or show oligaemia of aff ected segment, dilated pul-\nmonary artery, linear atelectasis, small pleural eff usion, wedge-shaped opacities or \ncavitation (rare). CTPA\u2014see \ufb01 g 4.16.\n  \n\u2022 ECG may be normal, or show tachycardia, right bundle branch block, right vent-\nricular strain (inverted T in V1 to V4). The classical SI QIII TIII pattern (p98) is rare.\n\ue007Further investigations are shown on p818.\nTreatment \ue022See p818. If haemodynamically unstable, thrombolyse for massive \nPE (alteplase 10mg IV over 1min, then 90mg IVI over 2h; max 1 . 5mg/kg if <65kg). \nHaemodynamically stable: start LMWH or unfractionated heparin if underlying renal \nimpairment and treat for 5 days. Then, start DOAC (direct oral anticoagulant) or war-\nfarin (p350). For warfarin, stop heparin when INR is 2\u20133, due to intial prothrombotic \neff ect of warfarin (target INR of 2\u20133). Consider placement of a vena caval \ufb01 lter if \ncontra-indication to anticoagulation.\nUnprovoked PE In patients with no known provoking risk factors, consider inves-\ntigation for possible underlying malignany. Undertake full history, examination \n(including breast), CXR, FBC, calcium, LFTS, urinalysis. Patients >40yrs consider abdo-\npelvic CT and mammography in women. Consider antiphospholipid and thrombo-\nphilia testing if family history positive (p374).\nPrevention Give heparin to all immobile patients. Stop HRT and the combined con-\ntraceptive pill pre-op (if reliable with another form of contraception).\nPneumothorax\nCaus es Often spontaneous (especially in young, thin men) due to rupture of a sub-\npleural bulla. Other causes: asthma; COPD; TB; pneumonia; lung abscess; carcinoma; \ncystic \ufb01 brosis; lung \ufb01 brosis; sarcoidosis; connective tissue disorders (Marfan\u2019s syn., \nEhlers\u2013Danlos syn.), trauma; iatrogenic (subclavian CVP line insertion, pleural aspira-\ntion/biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, liver biopsy, +ve pressure ventilation).\nClinical features Symptoms: May be asymptomatic (\ufb01 t, young, and small pneumo-\nthorax) or there may be sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Pa-\ntients with asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically \nventilated patients may present with hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures. \nSigns: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath \nsounds on the aff ected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi-\nated away from the aff ected side, p749, p815.
