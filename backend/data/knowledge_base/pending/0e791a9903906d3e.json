This is the reverse of osteoporosis \nin which mineralization is unchanged, but there is overall bone loss. Rickets is the \nresult if this process occurs during the period of bone growth; osteomalacia is the \nresult if it occurs after fusion of the epiphyses.\nSigns and symptoms\nRickets: Growth retardation, hypotonia, apathy in infants. Once walking: knock-\nkneed, bow-legged, and deformities of the metaphyseal\u2013epiphyseal junction (eg the \nrachitic rosary). Features of \ue001Ca\n2+\u2014often mild (p678). Children with rickets are ill.\nOsteomalacia: Bone pain and tenderness; fractures (esp. femoral neck); proximal \nmyopathy (waddling gait), due to \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9 and vitamin D de\ufb01 ciency per se.\nCauses\nVitamin D de\ufb01 ciency: Due to malabsorption (p266), poor diet, or lack of sunlight.\nRenal osteodystrophy: Renal failure leads to 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol de\ufb01 cien-\ncy [1,25(OH)2-vitamin D de\ufb01 ciency]. See also renal bone disease (p312).\nDrug-induced: Anticonvulsants may induce liver enzymes, leading to an increased \nbreakdown of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.\nVitamin D resistance: A number of mainly inherited conditions in which the os-\nteomalacia responds to high doses of vitamin D (see \u2018Treatment\u2019 later in this topic).\nLiver disease: Due to reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D to 25-hydroxy-cholecalcif-\nerol and malabsorption of vitamin D, eg in cirrhosis (p276).\nTumour-induced osteomalacia: (Oncogenic hypophosphataemia.) Mediated by \nraised tumour production of phosphat onin \ufb01 broblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) which \ncauses hyperphosphaturia. \ue001serum PO4\n3\u03a9 often causes myalgia and weakness.18\nInvestigations\nPlasma: Mildly \ue001Ca\n2+ (but may be severe); \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9; \ue000ALP; PTH high; \ue00125(OH)-vitamin D, \nexcept in vitamin D resistance. In renal failure, \ue0011,25(OH)2-vitamin D (p312).\nBiopsy: Bone biopsy shows incomplete mineralization. Muscle biopsy (if proximal \nmyopathy) is normal.\nX-ray: In osteomalacia, there is a loss of cortical bone; also, apparent partial frac-\ntures without displacement may be seen especially on the lateral border of the \nscapula, inferior femoral neck, and medial femoral shaft (Looser\u2019s zones; see \ufb01 g 14.9). \nCupped, ragged metaphyseal surfaces are seen in rickets (\ufb01 g 14.10).\nTreatment\n  \n\u2022 In dietary insuffi  ciency, give vitamin D, eg as one calcium D3 forte tablet/12h PO.\n  \n\u2022 In malabsorption or hepatic disease, give vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), up to 40 000U \n(=1mg) daily, or parenteral calcitriol, eg 7.5mg monthly.\n  \n\u2022 If due to renal disease or vitamin D resistance, give alfacalcidol (1\ue025-hydroxy-\nvitamin D3) 250ng\u20131mcg daily, or calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) 250ng\u20131mcg \ndaily, and adjust dose according to plasma Ca\n2+. \ue022Alfacalcidol and calcitriol can \ncause dangerous hypercalcaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor plasma Ca\n2+, initially weekly, and if nausea/vomiting.\nVitamin D-resistant rickets Exists in two forms. Type I has low renal 1\ue025-hydroxy-\nlase activity, and type II has end-organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, due \nto a point mutation in the receptor. Both are treated with large doses of calcitriol.\nX-linked hypophosphataemic rickets Dominantly inherited\u2014due to a defect in \nrenal phosphate handling (due to mutations in the PEX or PHEX genes which encode \nan endopeptidase). Rickets develops in early childhood and is associated with poor \ngrowth. Plasma PO4\n3\u03a9 is low, ALP is high, and there is phosphaturia. Treat ment is with \nhigh doses of oral phosphate, and calcitriol.", "text_length": 3705, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 692/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 691, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.360442", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.361457", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
