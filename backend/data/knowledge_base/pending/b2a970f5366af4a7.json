Often de\ufb01 ned by \ue001BP\u2014\nsystolic <90mmHg\u2014or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65mmHg\u2014with evidence of \ntissue hypoperfusion, eg mottled skin, urine output (UO) of <0.5mL/kg/h, serum \nlactate >2mmol/L. Signs: \ue001GCS/agitation, pallor, cool peripheries, tachycardia, slow \ncapillary re\ufb01 ll, tachypnoea, oliguria.\nMAP = cardiac output (CO) \u2248 systemic vascular resistance (SVR).\nCO = stroke volume \u2248 heart rate.\n\ue007 \ue018 shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both.\nInadequate cardiac output\n  \n\u2022 Hypovolaemia:\n  \n\u2022 Bleeding: trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, GI bleed.\n  \n\u2022 Fluid loss: vomiting, burns, \u2018third-space\u2019 losses, eg pancreatitis, heat exhaustion.\n  \n\u2022 Pump failure:\n  \n\u2022 Cardiogenic shock, eg ACS, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, acute valve failure.\n  \n\u2022 Secondary causes, eg PE, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade.\nPeripheral circulatory failure (loss of SVR)\n  \n\u2022 Sepsis: (p792) Infection with any organism can cause acute vasodilation from \nin\ufb02 ammatory cytokines. Gram \u2013ves can produce endotoxin, causing sudden and \nsevere shock but without signs of infection (fever, \ue000 WCC). Classically patients with \nsepsis are warm & vasodilated, but may be cold & shut down. Other diseases, eg \npancreatitis, can give a similar picture associated with the in\ufb02 ammatory cascade.\n  \n\u2022 Anaphylaxis: p794.\n  \n\u2022 Neurogenic: Eg spinal cord injury, epidural or spinal anaesthesia.\n  \n\u2022 Endocrine failure: Addison\u2019s disease, p836 or hypothyroidism; see p834.\n  \n\u2022 Other: Drugs, eg anaesthetics, antihypertensives, cyanide poisoning.\nAssessment \ue007\ue007ABCDE (p779). With shock we are dealing primarily with \u2018C \u2019 so get \nlarge-bore IV access \u22482 and check ECG for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will \ncompromise cardiac output), and signs of ischaemia.\n  \n\u2022 General review: Cold and clammy suggests cardiogenic shock or \ufb02 uid loss. Look \nfor signs of anaemia or dehydration, eg skin turgor, postural hypotension? Warm \nand well perfused, with bounding pulse points to septic shock. Any features sug-\ngestive of anaphylaxis\u2014history, urticaria, angioedema, wheeze?\n  \n\u2022 CVS: Usually tachycardic (unless on \ue020-blocker, or in spinal shock\u2014OHCS p757) and \nhypotensive. But in the young and \ufb01 t, or pregnant women, the systolic BP may \nremain normal, although the pulse pressure will narrow, with up to 30% blood \nvolume depletion. Diff erence between arms (>20mmHg)\u2014aortic dissection (p655)?\n  \n\u2022 JVP or central venous pressure: If raised, cardiogenic shock likely.\n  \n\u2022 Check abdomen: Any signs of trauma, or aneurysm? Any evidence of GI bleed?\nManagement \ue007If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.\n  \n\u2022 Septic shock: See p792.\n  \n\u2022 Anaphylaxis: See p794.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiogenic shock: See p802.\n  \n\u2022 Hypovolaemic shock: Identify and treat underlying cause. Raise the legs.\n  \u2022 Give \ufb02 uid bolus 10\u201315mL/kg crystalloid via large peripheral line, if shock improves, \nrepeat, titrate to HR (aim <100), BP (aim SBP >90) and UO (aim >0.5mL/kg/h).\n  \n\u2022 If no improvement after 2 boluses, consider referral to ICU.\n  \n\u2022 Haemorrhagic shock: Stop bleeding if possible. See table 19.2 for grading.\n  \n\u2022 If still shocked despite 2L crystalloid or present with class III/IV shock then \ncrossmatch blood (request O Rh\u2013ve in an emergency, see p348).\n  \u2022 Give FFP with red cells (1 : 1 ratio); aim for platelets >100 and \ufb01 brinogen >1 (guided \nby results, but eg 1 pool of platelets and 2 pools of cryoprecipitate per 6\u20138 units \nof red cells). Consider tranexamic acid 2g IV. Discuss with haematology early.\n  \n\u2022 Heat exposure (heat exhaustion):\n  \u2022 Tepid sponging + fanning; avoid ice and immersion. Resuscitate with IVI, eg 0.9% \nsaline \u00b1 hydrocortisone 100mg IV. Lorazepam 1\u20132mg IV or chlorpromazine 25mg \nIM/IV may be used to stop shivering.
