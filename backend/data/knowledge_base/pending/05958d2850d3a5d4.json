Large (eg 16F) are good for \ndrainage but can be uncomfortable for patients. Small (eg 10F) are more comfort-\nable for feeding but can be diffi  cult to aspirate and are poor for drainage. Used:\n  \n\u2022 To decompress the stomach/gastrointestinal tract especially when there is ob-\nstruction, eg gastric out\ufb02 ow obstruction, ileus, intestinal obstruction.\n  \n\u2022 For gastric lavage.\n  \n\u2022 To administer feed/drugs, especially in critically ill patients or those with dys-\nphagia, eg motor neuron disease, post CVA.\nPassing the tube Nurses are experts and will ask you (who may never have \npassed one) to do so only when they fail\u2014so the \ufb01 rst question to ask is: \u2018Have you \nasked the charge-nurse from the ward next door?\u2019\n  \n\u2022 Wear non-sterile gloves and an apron to protect both you and the patient.\n  \n\u2022 Explain the procedure. Take a new, cool (hence less \ufb02 exible) tube. Have a cup of \nwater to hand. Lubricate well with aqueous gel.\n  \n\u2022 Use the tube, by holding it against the patient\u2019s head, to estimate the length \nrequired to get from the nostril to the back of the throat.\n  \n\u2022 Place lubricated tube in nostril with its natural curve promoting passage down, \nrather than up. The right nostril is often easier than the left but, if feasible, ask \nthe patient for their preference. Advance directly backwards (not upwards).\n  \n\u2022 When the tip is estimated to be entering the throat, rotate the tube by ~180\u00b0 to \ndiscourage passage into the mouth.\n  \n\u2022 Ask the patient to swallow a sip of water, and advance as they do, timing each \npush with a swallow. If this fails: Try the other nostril.\n  \n\u2022 The tube has distance markings along it: the stomach is at ~35\u201340cm in adults, so \nadvance > this distance, preferably 10 \u201320cm beyond. Tape securely to the nose.\nCon\ufb01 rming position This is vital prior to commencing any treatment through the \ntube. Misplaced nasogastric tubes have led to a number of preventable deaths, \nand feeding via a misplaced tube is considered an NHS Never Event (a serious, \nlargely preventable patient safety incident that should never occur if the available \npreventative measures have been implemented).\n  \u2022 Use pH paper to test that you are in the stomach: aspirated gastric contents are \nacid (pH \u22645.5) although antacids or PPIS may increase the pH. Small tubes can be \ndiffi  cult to aspirate, try withdrawing or advancing a few cm or turning the patient \non the left side to help dip the tube in gastric contents. Aspirates should be >0.5mL \nand tested directly on unhandled pH paper. Allow 10s for colour change to occur.\n  \n\u2022 If the pH is >5.5 and the NGT is needed for drug or feed administration then the \nposition must be checked radiologically. Request a CXR/abdo X-ray (tell the radi-\nologist why you need it). Look for the radio-opaque line/tip (this can be hard to \nsee, look below the diaphragm, but if in doubt, ask for help from the radiologist).\n  \n\u2022 The \u2018whoosh\u2019 test is NOT an accepted method of testing for tube position.\n  \n\u2022 Either spigot the tube, or allow to drain into a dependent catheter bag secured \nto clothing (zinc oxide tape around tube to form a \ufb02 ap, safety pin through \ufb02 ap).\n\ue007Do not pass a tube nasally if there is any suspicion of a facial fracture.\n\ue007Get senior help if the patient has recently had upper GI surgery\u2014it is not good \npractice to push the tube through a fresh anastomosis.\nComplications \u2022Pain, or, rarely: \u2022Loss of electrolytes \u2022Oesophagitis \u2022Tracheal or \nduodenal intubation \u2022Necrosis: retro- or nasopharyngeal \u2022Stomach perforation.\nWeaning When planning removal of an NGT in situ for decompression or relief \nof obstruction, it is wise to wean it so that the patient manages well without it. \nDrainage should be <750mL/24 hours for successful weaning.\n  \n\u2022 First it should be on free drainage with, eg, 4hrly aspirations.\n  \n\u2022 Then spigot with 4hrly aspirations.\n  \n\u2022 Then spigot only. If this is tolerated along with oral intake then it is probably safe \nto remove the tube; if not, then take a step backwards.\nNasogastric tubes", "text_length": 4156, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 767/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 766, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.496665", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.498263", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
