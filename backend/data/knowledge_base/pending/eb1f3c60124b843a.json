The hall-\nmark is progressive accumulation of a malignant clone of functionally incompetent \nB cells. Mutations, trisomies, and deletions (eg del17p13) in \ufb02 uence risk (table 8.8).\nTable 8.8 Staging and survival in CLL\nRai stage: \n0 Lymphocytosis alone\nMedian survival >13yrs\n \nI Lymphocytosis + lymphadenopathy \n8yrs\n \nII Lymphocytosis + spleno- or hepatomegaly\n5yrs\n \nIII Lymphocytosis + anaemia (Hb <110g/L)\n2yrs\n \nIV Lymphocytosis + platelets <100 \u2248 10\n9/L\n1yr\nSymptoms Often none, presenting as a surprise \ufb01 nding on a routine FBC. Patients \nmay be anaemic or infection-prone, or have \ue001weight, sweats, anorexia if severe.\nSigns Enlarged, rubbery, non-tender nodes (\ufb01 g 8.56). Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly.\nTests \ue000Lymphocytes\u2014may be marked (\ufb01 g 8.57). Later: autoimmune haemolysis \n(p338), marrow in\ufb01 ltration: \ue001Hb, \ue001neutrophils, \ue001platelets.\nComplications 1 Autoimmune haemolysis. 2 \ue000Infection due to hypogammaglobuli-\nnaemia (=\ue001IgG), bacterial, viral especially herpes zoster. 3 Marrow failure.\nTreatment Consider drugs if symptomatic. Fludarabine + rituximab \u00b1 cyclophos-\nphamide is 1st line (there is synergism). Ibrutinib, chlorambucil, bendamustine, and \nofatumumab all have a role. Steroids help autoimmune haemolysis. Radiotherapy \nhelps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Stem-cell transplantation may have \na role in carefully selected patients. Supportive care: Transfusions, IV human im-\nmunoglobulin if recurrent infection.\nNatural history \u2153 never progress (or even regress), \u2153 progress slowly, and \u2153 pro-\ngress actively. CD23 and \ue0202 microglobulin correlate with bulk of disease and rates of \nprogression. Death is often due to infection or transformation to aggressive lym-\nphoma (Richter\u2019s syndrome).\nFig 8.56 Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy \nin CLL.\nFig 8.57 CLL: many lymphocytes and a \u2018smear\u2019 \ncell: a fragile cell damaged in preparation.\nCourtesy of Prof. Christine Lawrence.", "text_length": 2092, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 367/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 366, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.797913", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.798759", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
