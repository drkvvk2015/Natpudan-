Instead, unlike James\u2019 heroine Isabel \nArcher, as she explored late 19th-century Rome, we are left seeing a greal deal less \nthan perhaps is there. The failure to see, then becomes a failure to comprehend \n(the endoscopy and CT were normal, so there must be nothing wrong?)\u2014then a \nfailure to believe and ultimately to treat an illness.\nBefore we subject any intervention to the rigors of medical trials, we should \ufb01 rst \nagree a classi\ufb01 cation of the disease process we are aiming to treat. Some of medi-\ncine\u2019s darkest alcoves re\ufb02 ect less a lack of potential treatments and more a lack of \nany agreement on where classi\ufb01 cation boundaries lie. Failure to de\ufb01 ne and distin-\nguish pathologies then leads to a literature studded with small con\ufb02 icting studies \non heterogeneous patients which feeds a perception of a condition as \u2018untreatable\u2019.\nThere is nothing romantic about constipation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction \nin general, other than the association of the de\ufb01 nitions of these disorders with \nRome. By the late 1980s, these confused areas exempli\ufb01 ed the above-described \nchallenges. Recognition of the need for order and classi\ufb01 cation to support studies \nled to an international collaboration, born out of the University of Rome. A process \nof expert debate and discussion reached consensus de\ufb01 nitions that could support \nscienti\ufb01 c studies. The experts then periodically reconvene in the eternal city to \nrevisit and evaluate these \u2018Rome consensus\u2019 de\ufb01 nitions. Rather more prosaically, \nthe Rome foundation itself is now headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. \nDe\ufb01 ning gastrointestinal dysfunction\u2014the Rome criteria", "text_length": 3722, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 269/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 268, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.491228", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.496855", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
