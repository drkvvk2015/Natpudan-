Major crite-\nria: (Diagnostic if >2): lens dislocation (ectopia lentis; \ufb01 g 15.9); aortic dissection/\ndilat ation; dural ectasia; skeletal features: arachnodactyly (long spidery \ufb01 ngers), \narmspan > height, pectus deformity, scoliosis, pes planus. Minor signs: Mitral valve \nprolapse, high-arched palate, joint hypermobility. Diagnosis is clinical; MRI for dural \nectasia. \ue057: The danger is aortic dissection: \ue020-blockers slow dilatation of the aortic \nroot. Annual echos, surgical repair when aortic diameter is >5cm. In pregnancy \ue000risk \nof dissection. Homocystinuria has similar skeletal deformities.  \n \nAntoine Bernard-Jean Marfan, 1858\u20131942 (French paediatrician)\nTable 15.3 Comparing Marfan's and homocystinuria\nMarfan\u2019s\nvs\nHomocystinuria\nUpwards lens dislocation\nDownwards lens dislocation\nAortic valve incompetence\nHeart rarely aff ected\nNormal intelligence\nMental retardation\nScoliosis, \ufb02 at feet, herniae\nRecurrent thromboses, osteoporosis\nLife expectancy is lower due\nto cardiovascular risks\nPositive urine cyanide-nitroprusside test\nResponse to treatment with pyridoxine\nMeckel\u2019s diverticulum The distal ileum contains embryonic remnants of gastric \nand pancreatic tissue. There may be gastric acid secretion, causing GI pain & occult \nbleeding. \ue031: Radionucleotide scan; laparotomy.  Johann Friedrich Meckel, 1781\u20131833 (German anatomist)\nMeigs\u2019 syndrome A triad of 1 benign ovarian tumour (\ufb01 broma) 2 pleural eff usion \n(R>L) & 3 ascites. It resolves on tumour resection. \nJoe Vincent Meigs, 1892\u20131963 (US gynaecologist)\nM\u00e9n\u00e9trier\u2019s disease Giant gastric mucosal folds up to 4cm high, in the fundus, with \natrophy of the glands + \ue000mucosal thickness + hypo chlorhydria + protein-losing gastrop-\nathy (hence hypoalbuminaemia \u00b1 oedema). Causes: CMV, strep, H. pylori. There may \nbe epigastric pain, vomiting, \u00b1 \ue001weight. It is pre-malignant. \ue057: Treat H. pylori or CMV if \npresent; give high-dose PPI; if this fails, consider epidermal growth factor blockade with \ncetuximab or gastrectomy (eg if intractable symptoms or malignant change). Epider-\nmal growth factor receptor blockade with cetuximab is 1st\u2013line treatment.55 Surgery if \nintractable symptoms or malignant change. \nPierre Eug\u00e8ne M\u00e9n\u00e9trier, 1859\u20131935 (French pathologist)\nMeyer\u2013Betz syndrome (Paroxysmal myoglobinuria.) Rare idiopathic condition \ncausing necrosis of exercising muscles. There is muscle pain, weakness, and discol-\noured urine: pink\ue003brown (as \ue000myoglobin is excreted). Acute kidney injury can result \nfrom myoglobinuria (p319). DIC is associated. Tests: \ue000WCC, \ue000LFT, \ue000LDH, \ue000CPK, \ue000urine \nmyoglobin. Diagnosis: Muscle biopsy, \ue000CPK, and \ue000serum myoglobin. Exertion should \nbe avoided. \nFriedrich Meyer-Betz, described 1910 (German physician)\nMikulicz\u2019s syndrome Benign persistent swelling of lacrimal and parotid (or sub-\nmandibular) glands due to lymphocytic in\ufb01 ltration. Exclude other causes (sarcoidosis, \nTB, viral infection, lymphoproliferative disorders). It is thought to be an IgG4-related \nplasmacytic systemic disease.56 \nJohann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki, 1850\u20131905 (Polish\u2013Austrian surgeon)\nMilroy disease 1\u00b0 congenital lymphoedema. Mutations in the VEGFR3 gene (dominant) \ncause lymphatic malfunction with lower leg swelling from birth (\ufb01 g 15.10). \ue031: Lym-\nphoscintigraphy; genetic testing. \ue057: \u2022Compression hosiery/bandages. \u2022Encourage ex-\nercise. \u2022Good skin hygiene. \u2022Treat cellulitis actively. William Forsyth Milroy, 1855\u20131942 (US physician)\nM\u00fcnchausen\u2019s syndrome Vivid liars, who are addicted to institutions, \ufb02 it from hos-\np ital to hospital, feigning illness, eg hoping for a laparotomy or mastectomy, or they \ncomplain of awful bleeding, odd eye movements, curious \ufb01 ts, sexual assaults, throat \nclosings, false asthma, or heart attacks. M\u00fcnchausen-by-proxy entails injury to a de-\npendent person by a carer (eg mother) to gain medical attention.  \n \n \nKarl Friedrich Hieronymus, Freiherr von M\u00fcnchausen, 1720\u20131797 (German aristocrat). Described by RAJ Asher in 195157\nOgilvie\u2019s syndrome (Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.) Colonic obstruction in \nthe absence of a mechanical cause, associated with recent severe illness or surgery. \n\ue057: Correct U&E. Colonoscopy allows decomp ression, and excludes mechanical causes. \nNeostigmine is also eff ective, suggesting parasympathetic suppression is to blame.58 \nSurgery is rarely needed (eg if perforation). \nWilliam Heneage Ogilvie, 1887\u20131971 (British surgeon)", "text_length": 4650, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 714/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 713, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.396532", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.397253", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
