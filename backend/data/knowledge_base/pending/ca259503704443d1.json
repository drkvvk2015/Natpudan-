Person-to-person transmission via droplets or upper respiratory tract secre-\ntions. Most strains are harmless but induce immunity. Pathogenic, virulent strains \nare mostly encapsulated and have the potential to cause septicaemia and meningitis. \nSerogroups A, B, C, W and Y account for nearly all invasive forms. \ue001Group C following \nintroduction of vaccination in UK. \ue000 in serotype W in UK since 2009. Incubation 2\u20137d. \nPeak ages: <2yr, ~18yr. Risk factors: complement system defects, hyposplenism, HIV. \nPresentation:\n1   Meningitis (~50% cases). Main proliferation of bacteria is in CSF. Insidious onset \nwith malaise, nausea, headache, vomiting. May be misdiagnosed as gastroenteri-\ntis, URTI, or childhood viral illness. Later meningism: headache, vomiting, nuchal/\nback rigidity, photophobia, altered consciousness. Complications in up to 20%: \nsensorineural hearing loss, impaired vestibular function, epilepsy, diff use brain \ninjury.\n2   Meningococcaemia. Symptoms/signs depends on amount of circulating bacte-\nria. Mild disease presents with fever, macular rash (\ufb01 g 9.6) but no signs of shock. \nHigh-grade meningococcaemia (~30% cases) causes pyrexia and septic shock \nwithin 6\u201312h due to rapidly escalating endotoxin levels: circulatory failure, co-\nagulopathy with skin haemorrhage (\ufb01 g 9.7), thrombosis of extremities/adrenals, \nAKI, ARDS. Meningism may be absent. Complications: amputation, skin necrosis, \npericarditis, arthritis, ocular infection, pneumonia (especially serotypes Y and W), \npermanent adrenal insuffi  ciency.\nDiagnosis: \ue022Start treatment immediately if meningitis/meningococcal sepsis is \na possible diagnosis. Do not wait for con\ufb01 rmation: delay can be deadly. Intra- and \nextracellular diplococci on microscopy of CSF/blood/skin lesion. PCR of CSF/blood/\nskin lesion. Treatment: urgent antibiotic treatment: benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone (see \npp822\u20133). Cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, meropenem also bactericidal. Prevention: \nroutine infant vaccination against capsular group C in UK. Capsular group B vaccine in \nUK infants since 2015: induces bacteriocidal antibodies, no population data, duration \nof protection unknown. Quadrivalent ACWY vaccine at age 14 and if high-risk travel. \nAdditional B, C, ACWY doses if hyposplenism and complement de\ufb01 ciency. Prophylaxis \nof contacts: cipro\ufb02 oxacin/ceftriaxone (single dose), or rifampicin 600mg BD for 48h.\nNeisseria gonorrhoea: see pp412\u20133.\nMoraxella catarrhalis:\nColonizes upper respiratory tract in children (\ue001 in adults). Resembles Neisseria com-\nmensal so may be overlooked. Presentation: pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, up to \n20% of acute otitis media, sinusitis. Bacteraemia is rare. Diagnosis: culture of sputum, \near eff usion, sinus aspirate, blood. \u2018Hockey puck sign\u2019: colonies can be pushed along \nagar surface without disruption. Treatment: macrolide, cephalosporin.\nFig 9.6 Macular lesions on legs.\nReproduced from Warrell et al.
