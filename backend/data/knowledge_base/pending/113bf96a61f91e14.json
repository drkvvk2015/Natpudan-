Filarial parasites (nematodes) trans-\nmitted via mosquitoes which bite infected hosts and ingest \nmicro\ufb01 laria. These mature in the mosquito with infective \nlarvae transferring to new hosts during feeding. Adult \nworms form nests in lymphatic vessels causing damage and \nlymphoedema. Transmission prevented by an annual dose \nof two drugs\u20145.63 billion treatments delivered by WHO since \n2000.12 Types of \ufb01 larial worm:\n  \n\u2022 Wuchereria bancrofti (\ufb01 g 9.29) ~90% of disease.\n  \u2022 Brugia malaya ~10%.\n  \n\u2022 Brugia timori possible cause of disease.\nPresentation: Asymptomatic infection \u00b1 subclinical lym-\nphatic damage. Acute episodes of local in\ufb02 ammation: pain, \nfever. Chronic damage: lymphoedema (\ufb01 g 9.30), hydrocele, \nchylocele, scrotal/penile swelling. CKD: proteinuria, haema-\nturia. Immune hyper reactivity \ue003tropical pulmonary eo-\nsinophilia (cough, wheeze, \ufb01 brosis, \ue000eosinophil counts, \ue000IgE). \nDiagnosis: Micro\ufb01 lariae in blood smear (\ufb01 g 9.29), anti\ufb01 larial \nIgG, visualization of worms on USS/tissue sample. Treatment: \nLymphoedema care. Prevention in high-risk populations: al-\nbendazole plus either diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermec-\ntin. DEC is contraindicated in onchocerciasis (p439), care with \n\ue000circulating Loa Loa (p439) due to risk of encephalopathy and \nrenal failure.

Human cases rare until outbreak in Paci\ufb01 c Islands (2007\u20132013), \nand Brazil (2015). Estimated 1.5 million cases in Brazil by 2016. Zika detected in \nsperm and blood products so transmission not limited to vector. Up-to-date geo-\ngraphic and clinical data available at: www.ecdc.europa.eu Presentation: Subclinical \nin ~80%. Mild illness in ~20%: fever, conjunctivitis, myalgia, rash. Severe acute \nillness and Guillian\u2013Barr\u00e9 are rare. Zika and birth defects: Geographical and tem-\nporal relationship between infection and microcephaly. Zika detected in amniotic \n\ufb02 uid is evidence of placental transfer. Speci\ufb01 c fetal syndrome: microcephaly, in-\ntracranial calci\ufb01 cation, eye pathology, redundant scalp skin. Small, uncontrolled \nstudies show fetal abnormalities in up to 30% of pregnant women infected with \nZika.13 Absolute and relative risks unknown (2016). Diagnosis: PCR of viral DNA in \nblood/body \ufb02 uid. Treatment: Vector control, avoid non-essential travel in preg-\nnancy, condoms to prevent sexual transmission. Vaccine trials ongoing (2016).\nZika virus\nFig 9.30 Lymphoedema.\nReproduced with permis-\nsion from World Health \nOrganization. \u00a9 World \nHealth Organization.\nhttp://www.who.int/lymphatic_\n\ufb01 lariasis/disease/en/ \nSince 1990, \ufb01 ve species of Aedes mosquito have become established in Europe. \nThe adaptation of mosquitoes to a temperate environment, combined with fu-\nture climate forecasts has led to models14 that predict the UK will be suitable for:\n  \n\u2022 Plasmodium falciparum transmission by 2030\u20132080\n  \n\u2022 Plasmodium vivax transmission by 2030\n  \n\u2022 Chikungunya transmission in London by 2041\n  \n\u2022 Dengue transmission after 2100.\nOf course, modelling is not simple. Socioeconomic development, urbanization, \nland-use change, migration, and globalization all come into play. Surveillance of \nmosquitoes at sea-ports, airports, and used-tyre companies remains uninteresting \nto date. But consider a time when a visit to South-East England off ers an oppor-\ntunity to explore the historical gems of our wonderful capital, and simultaneously \nbecomes a pertinent question in your diagnostic sieve....\nThe global advance of vector-borne disease?\nFig 9.29 Blood smear of \nW. bancrofti (290\u22488.5\u03bcm).\nCourtesy of Prof. S.
