Our gut, skin, and mucosal linings are covered \nwith bacteria. We rely on this for nutrition, functioning vitamin K, anti-in\ufb02 ammatory \neff ects, and immune system regulation.\nBacterial disease results from a breach of the measures that limit bacteria to \ntheir \u2018normal\u2019 roles: skin commensals moved into the bloodstream by a cannula, an-\ntibiotics altering the commensal micro\ufb02 ora, immune system evasion or dysfunction \nallowing organisms to stray beyond their usual boundaries, toxin production. When \ntreating infections we should therefore remember to look beyond the off ending or-\nganism and consider what factors may have aided pathogenesis: malnutrition, \u2018bar-\nrier\u2019 breach by cancer/plastic, immunosuppression.\n\ue007See \u2018Sepsis\u2019, p792.\nBacteria: Prokaryotic micro-organism without a membrane-bound nucleus.\nClassi\ufb01 cation of bacteria: By microscopy and culture of infected samples.\nInforms antibiotic choice. Includes:\n  \n\u2022 Gram stain: a staining technique. Bacteria with \nthick, exposed peptidoglycan layers will stain \n\u2018Gram positive\u2019 (purple/blue). Bacteria with a \nprotected peptidoglycan layer will counterstain \npink/red and are \u2018Gram negative\u2019 (\ufb01 g 9.3).\n  \n\u2022 Shape: cocci = round; bacilli = rod-shaped; \nspiro chaete = spiral.\n  \n\u2022 Aerobes/anaerobes: some bacteria cannot sur-\nvive without oxygen (obligate aerobes), whilst \nothers cannot grow in its presence (obligate an-\naerobes). Many more can survive in either en-\nvironment (facultative anaerobes). Some types \nof infection are more likely to involve aerobic \nor anaerobic bacteria, eg GI infections are typi-\ncally anaerobic.\nBacteraemia: Bacteria circulating in the\nbloodstream.\nBacteriocidal: Kills bacteria both in and out\nof the replication cycle.\nBacteriostatic: Stops replication without killing existing bacteria.\nCapsulate bacteria: Bacteria with a thick outer capsule, eg Haemophilus in\ufb02 uen-\nzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These are destroyed \nin the spleen. Following splenectomy (or splenic infarction, eg sickle cell anaemia) \nthere is an increased risk of infection by capsulate bacteria and prophylactic vac-\ncination should be off ered (p407).\nCommensal: An organism that lives in/on a host without causing harm.\nEndotoxin: A lipopolysaccharide complex found on the outer membrane of Gram-\nnegative bacteria. Can elicit an in\ufb02 ammatory response. Activates complement via \nthe alternative pathway.\nEnterotoxin: Exotoxin that targets the gut, eg Clostridium dif\ufb01 cile toxin (p411).\nExotoxin: Toxins secreted by bacteria acting at a site distant from bacterial \ngrowth. Production of an exotoxin can determine virulence, eg botulinum, tetanus, \ndiphtheria, shiga toxins.\nFlagella: A tail-like appendage that moves to propel the bacterium, eg Helico-\nbacter pylori.\nNosocomial: Acquired in a hospital/healthcare setting (pp410\u20131).\nObligate intracellular: Bacteria that can only survive in host cells \ue018 induce a cell-\nmediated immune response and will not grow on standard culture media.\nZiehl\u2013Neelsen stain: Mycolic acid in the cell wall of mycobacteria resists Gram \nstaining but will appear red with acid-fast techniques (= acid-fast stain). \nBacterial glossary\nFig 9.3 (a) Gram-positive versus \n(b) Gram-negative cell membranes.\nReprinted by permission from Macmil-\nlan Publishers Ltd: Nature Reviews \nMicrobiology, Cabeen et al., 3(8), 601\u2013610, \ncopyright 2005.", "text_length": 3620, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 390/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 389, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.842036", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.843058", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
