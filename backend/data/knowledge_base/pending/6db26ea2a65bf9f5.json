Failure to meet this de\ufb01 nition means non-living, dead, dying, or perhaps male. \nLife is a thing of dynamism, fragility, beauty, danger, and evanescence; gushing \nforth from a single source. But here the certainties end: what does it really take \nto be alive? Are viruses and prions living? How many branches are there on our \ntree? The harder we look, the more complexities we \ufb01 nd. The Hillis plot is a circular \nphylogenetic tree, and a representation of humanity\u2019s place in nature. We are duly \nhumbled by this challenge to our imagined self-importance, reminding us that we \ndo not in reality occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of the living, just a \nunique subunit RNA sequence (\ufb01 g 9.2).\nBecause micro-organisms kill our friends we think of them as bad:\n\u2018I have no philosophy, nor piety, no art of re\ufb02 ection, no theory of compensa-\ntion to meet things so hid eous, so cruel, and so mad, they are just unspeak-\nably horrible and irremediable to me and I stare at them with angry and \nalmost blighted eyes.\u2019\nHenry James, 1915, describing the death of Rupert Brooke from septicaemia.\nBut this is a mistake. Kill off  micro-organisms and the whole show \ufb01 zzles out. \nMicro-organisms gave us the DNA and organelles needed for reading and digesting \nthis page. Even killing a single pathogen might be a mistake: Sod\u2019s Law will prob-\nably ensure that something worse will come to inhabit the vacated ecospace. Prod \none part of the system and events ripple out in an unending stream of unintended \nconsequences, played out under the stars, which themselves are evolving, and \nwhich donate and receive our primordial elements.\nCan we win against infectious diseases? No. But winning or losing is the wrong \nimage: infectious diseases have made us who we are. All we can do is live with \nthem. To help us do this in ways that are not too destructive we need robust \npublic health surveillance, sound vector-control policies, political will, quarantine \nlaws, openness, and cooperation. Most importantly, do not underestimate the \nimportance of maintaining our infectious cohabitants in their apparent subor-\ndinate position. The speed and capacity for learning by ribonucleic malware and \nsingle-celled organisms is amazing. So do not inadvertently teach them. Preserve \nyour precious warfare tactics. Expose them to antibiotic therapies only in a \nstand-off  situation from which they cannot return to \ufb01 ght again.\nWhat is life?\nFig 9.2 Tree of life based on subunit RNA sequences sampled from ~3000 species out of the 1.7 \nmillion species that are formally named.
