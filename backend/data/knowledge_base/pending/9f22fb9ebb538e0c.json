Other addictions may coexist. Lifetime prevalence: \ue032~10% \n(\ue033 \u2248 4%). \ue007Denial is a leading feature, so be sure to question relatives.\nOrgans aff ected \ue007Don\u2019t forget the risk of trauma while intoxicated.\nThe liver: Normal in 50%; \ue000 or \ue000\ue000\ue034GT\n30\u2014but may be \ue000\ue000 in any type of liver in\ufb02 amma-\ntion, eg fatty liver, AIH (p284), HBV. Fatty liver: Acute/reversible, but may progress \nto cirrhosis if drinking continues (also seen in obesity, DM, and with amiodarone). \nAlcoholic hepatitis: See BOX \u2018Managing alcoholic hepatitis\u2019. 80% progress to cir-\nrhosis (hepatic failure in 10%). Cirrhosis: (See p276.) 5yr survival is 48% if drinking \ncontinues (if not, 77%). Biopsy: Mallory bodies \u00b1 neutrophil in\ufb01 ltrate (can be indis-\ntinguishable from NASH, p277).\nCNS: Self neglect; \ue001memory/cognition: high-potency vitamins IM may reverse it (p714; \ndon\u2019t delay!); cortical atrophy; retrobulbar neuropathy; \ufb01 ts; falls; wide-based gait; \nneuropathy; confabulation/Korsakoff \u2019s (p704) \u00b1 Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy (p714).\nGut: Obesity; D&V; gastric erosions; peptic ulcers; varices (p257); pancreatitis (acute \nor chronic); cancer (many types); oesophageal rupture (\ue013  vomiting against a closed \nglottis; suspect if shock and surgical emphysema in the neck: Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome).\nBlood: \ue000MCV; anaemia from: marrow depression, GI bleeding, alcoholism-associated \nfolate de\ufb01 ciency, haemolysis; sideroblastic anaemia. See p326.\nHeart: Arrhythmias; \ue000BP; cardiomyopathy; sudden death in binge drinkers.\nReproduction: Testicular atrophy; \ue001testosterone/progesterone; \ue000oestrogen; fetal al-\ncohol syndrome\u2014\ue001IQ, short palpebral \ufb01 ssure, absent philtrum, and small eyes.\nWithdrawal starts 10\u201372h after last drink. Signs: \ue000Pulse; \ue001BP; tremor; confusion; \ufb01 ts; \nhallucinations (delirium trem ens)\u2014may be visual or tactile, eg animals crawling all \nover skin. Consider it in any new (\ue0053d) ward patient with acute confusion.\nManagement Alcohol withdrawal: There is almost no role for hospital inpatient \n\u2018detox\u2019 as a sole indication for admission however attractive the idea of a \u2018quick \ufb01 x\u2019 \nmay be\u2014community-based services are much better placed to support cessation. \nAdmit only if complicating or coexisting medical problems require inpatient treat-\nment. Check BP + TPR/4h. Beware \ue001BP. For the 1st 3d give generous chlordiazepoxide, \neg 10\u201350mg/6h PO with additional doses PRN, then sum total dose and plan weaning \nregimen over 5\u20137d. Vitamins may be needed (p714). Prevention: (OHCS p512.) Alcohol-\nfree beers; price may help promote lower-risk drinking. NB: there are no absolutes: \nrisk is a continuum. Suggest: 1 Graceful ways of declining a drink, eg \u2018I\u2019m seeing \nwhat it\u2019s like to go without for a bit\u2019. 2 Not buying him- or herself a drink when it is \nhis/her turn. 3 \u2018Don\u2019t lift your glass to your lips until after the slowest drinker in your \ngroup takes a drink.\u2019 4 \u2018Sip, don\u2019t gulp.\u2019 Give follow-up and encouragement. Treating \nestablished alcoholics: May be rewarding, particularly if they really want to change. \nIf so, group therapy or self-help (eg Alcoholics Anonym ous) may be useful\u2014espe-\ncially if self-initiated and determined. Encourage the will to change.\nRelapse 50% will relapse soon after starting treatment. Acamprosate (p449) may \nhelp intense anxiety, insomnia, and craving. CI: pregnancy, severe liver failure, \ncreatinine >120\u03bcmol/L. SE: D&V, \ue000 or \ue001libido; dose example: 666mg/8h PO if >60kg \nand <65yrs old. It should be started as soon as acute withdrawal is complete and \ncontinued for ~1yr. Disul\ufb01 ram can be used to treat chronic alcohol dependence. It \ncauses acetaldehyde build-up (like metronidazole) with extremely unpleasant ef-\nfects to any alcohol ingestion\u2014eg \ufb02 ushing, throbbing headache, palpitations. Care \nmust be taken to avoid alcohol (eg toiletries, food, medicines) since severe reac-\ntions can occur. \ue007Confer with experts if drugs are to be used.\n30 \ue034GT is \ue000 in 52% of alcoholics; it is also \ue000 in 50% of those with non-alcoholic fatty livers. Its best use is not \nin diagnosing alcoholism but in seeing if a raised ALP is likely to be from liver, not bone.", "text_length": 4380, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 288/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 287, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.544931", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.545860", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
