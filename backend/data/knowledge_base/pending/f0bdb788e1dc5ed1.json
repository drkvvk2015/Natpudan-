Yet \u2018cancer\u2019 is not a homogenous disease but \na group of conditions with prognoses ranging from very good (98% 10yr survival \nfor testicular cancer) to extremely poor (21% 1yr survival for pancreatic cancer).1\nCommunication2 is the \ufb01 rst step on a cancer pathway and underpins whatever \nthat diagnosis may subsequently entail for the individual. A range of overwhelm-\ning feelings can surface upon receiving a cancer diagnosis: shock, numbness, deni-\nal, panic, anger, resignation (\u2018I knew all along\u2026\u2019). Preconceptions, possibly derived \nvicariously from friends and family, may be deeply embedded leading to despair \nor inappropriate optimism. Without an understanding of your patient\u2019s starting \npoint, you may fail to be eff ective in your guidance and support.\nTips for the discussion of a cancer diagnosis\n1   Set the environment up carefully. Choose a quiet place where you will not be \ndisturbed. Make sure family or friends are present according to your patient\u2019s \nwishes. Anticipate likely questions and be sure of your facts.\n2   Find out what the patient already knows and believes (often a great deal). \n\u2018What are you worried about today?\u2019\n3   Give some warning: \u2018There is some bad news for us to address\u2019.\n4   Ascertain how much the person wants to know. \u2018Are you someone who likes \nto know all the details about your condition?\u2019 Although information is a prior-\nity for the majority of cancer patients, this may change with the individual, \nand the course of the disease. \u2018Monitors\u2019 will seek information, \u2018blunters\u2019 will \ndistract themselves.\n5   Share information about diagnosis and treatments. Speci\ufb01 cally list support-\ning people (oncology multidisciplinary team) and institutions (hospices). Break \ninformation down into manageable chunks and check understanding for each.\n6   Invite questions patients may feel they cannot ask. \u2018Is there anything else you \nwant me to explain?\u2019 Do not hesitate to go over the same ground repeatedly. \nAllow denial, don\u2019t force the pace, give time. Listen to any concerns raised, \nencourage the airing of feelings. Empathize.\n7   Address prognosis. Be honest. Doctors are often too optimistic. Encourage \nan appropriate level of hope (see BOX \u2018Spiritual pain\u2019, p535), refer to an expert.\n8   Make a plan. The desire to be involved in decisions about treatment is vari-\nable: your patient\u2019s locus of control can be internal (desire control of their \nown destiny) or external (passive acceptance). Decision-making can be im-\nmediate, deferred, panicked, or rationally deliberated. Time may be required \nto facilitate any style of decision-making: your plan may be simply to come \nback and talk again.\n9   Summarize, and off er availability. Record details of your conversation includ-\ning the language used.\n10   Follow through. \ue007Leave your patient with the knowledge that you are with \nthem, and that your unwritten contract will not be broken.\nNo rules guarantee success. Use whatever your patient gives you\u2014closely observe \nboth verbal and non-verbal cues. Getting to know your patient, seeking out the \nright expert for each stage of treatment, and making an agreed management \nplan, are all required.\nFor any situation which involves the communication of bad news, consider \nSPIKES:3\n  \n\u2022 Setting up the interview.\n  \n\u2022 Assess the patient\u2019s Perception of the situation.\n  \n\u2022 Obtain an Invitation (asking the patient\u2019s permission to explain).\n  \n\u2022 Give Knowledge and information to the patient.\n  \n\u2022 Address the Emotional response with Empathy.\n  \n\u2022 Strategy and Summary: aim for consensus with patient and family.\nLooking after people with cancer", "text_length": 3986, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 527/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 526, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.081516", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.082294", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
