It is dependent (distributed by gravity), which is why legs are aff ected \nearly, but severe oedema extends above the legs. In the bed-bound, \ufb02 uid moves to \nthe new dependent area, causing a sacral pad. The exception is the local increase \nin venous pressure occurring in IVC obstruction: the swelling neither extends above \nthe legs nor redistributes. Causes: \u2022Right heart failure (p134). \u2022\ue001Albumin (p686, eg \nrenal or liver failure). \u2022Venous insuffi  ciency: acute, eg prolonged sitting, or chronic, \nwith haemosiderin-pigmented, itchy, eczematous skin \u00b1 ulcers. \u2022Vaso dilators, eg \nnifedipine, amlodipine. \u2022Pelvic mass (p57, p604). \u2022Pregnancy\u2014if \ue000BP + proteinuria, \ndiagnose pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48): \ufb01 nd an obstetrician urgently. In all the above, \nboth legs need not be aff ected to the same extent.\nUnilateral oedema Pain \u00b1 redness implies DVT or in\ufb02 ammation, eg cellulitis or in-\nsect bites (any blisters?). Bone or muscle may be to blame, eg tumours; necrotizing \nfasciitis (p660); trauma (check for sensation, pulses, and severe pain esp. on pas-\nsive movement: \ue007a compartment syndrome with ischaemic necrosis needs prompt \nfasciotomy). Impaired mobility suggests trauma, arthritis, or a Baker\u2019s cyst (p694). \nNon-pitting oedema is oedema you cannot indent: see p35.\nNine questions to ask\n1   Is it both legs?\n2   Is she pregnant?\n3   Is she mobile?\n4   Any trauma?\n5   Any pitting (p35)?\n6   Past diseases/on drugs?\n7   Any pain?\n8   Any skin changes?\n9   Any oedema elsewhere?\nTests \ue007Look for proteinuria (+hypoalbuminaemia \u2248nephrotic syndrome). CCF?\nTreatment of leg oedema Treat the cause. Diuretics for all is not an answer. Elevat-\ning legs for dependent oedema (ankles higher than hips\u2014do not just use footstools); \nraise the foot of the bed. Graduated support stockings may help (CI: ischaemia).\nLong-distance travel appears to be a risk factor for the development of venous \nthromboembolism (VTE). Data suggests this is not con\ufb01 ned to air travel, increases \nwith the duration of travel, and results in clinical thrombosis more often in travel-\nlers with pre-existing risk factors. Dehydration, immobilization, decreased oxygen \ntension, and prolonged sitting have all been suggested as contributory factors.\nThe risk of developing a DVT from a long-distance \ufb02 ight has been estimated at 1 in \n10 000 to 1 in 40 000 for the general population.\n  \n\u2022 The incidence of DVT in high-risk groups has been shown to be 4\u20136% for \ufb02 ights \n>10h. Travellers with \u22651 risk factor should consider compression stockings. For \nhigh-risk individuals consider a single dose of prophylactic LMWH for \ufb02 ights >6h.\n  \n\u2022 There is \ue000risk of PE associated with long-distance air travel.\n  \n\u2022 Compression stockings may \ue001 risk of DVT.\n  \n\u2022 There is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic aspirin.\n  \n\u2022 Risk reduction measures: leg exercises, increased water intake, and refraining \nfrom alcohol or caff eine during the journey.\nTravel and DVT", "text_length": 3219, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 587/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 586, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.187634", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.188663", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
