The ice test,\nsleep test, and response to anticholinesterase agents (especially the edrophonium test) are useful in confirming\nthe diagnosis, and reduce the likelihood when results are negative. A positive test result should prompt\nacetylcholine receptor antibody testing and specialist referral for electrophysiologic tests and should help\nconfirm the diagnosis in patients who have negative results for the acetylcholine receptor antibody panel\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2005 293:15\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES BETWEEN HORNER\u2019S SYNDROME AND THIRD NERVE PALSY\nHorner\u2019s syndrome\nThird nerve palsy\nPtosis\nPartial.
