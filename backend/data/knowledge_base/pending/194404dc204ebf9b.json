The third \nday of admission brings me some examples of \ndoctor\u2019s communication skills being the worst \nI could possibly imagine under the most painful \nof circumstances...I\u2019m laid in a hospital bed sob-\nbing and scared, about at the most vulnerable \na patient could be...a young gynaecology SHO I \nhave never met enters my room...I can tell he \nhas pulled the short straw... He nervously sits \ndown next to me and out of the blue, after a \ncursory introduction tells me, \u2018Your MRI shows \nevidence of spread\u2019. I am quite astounded at \nthe lack of quality communication given the \ncircumstances.\nThe Other Side, by Kate Granger MBE, FRCP, \n1981\u20132016.\nKate Granger, a medical registrar then consult-\nant geriatrician, was diagnosed with a desmo-\nplastic small round cell tumour at the age of \n29. This is a cancer that medical science has no \nanswer to. But Kate had her own answer. She \nturned her terminal diagnosis on its head and \nbegan a dialogue on death and dying, off ering \nher experience as an inspirational lesson in \ncompassion and care. Before you are a patient, \nbefore you have cancer, but most importantly, \nbefore you are a doctor, you are simply a human \nbeing. And if your humanity is lost or forgotten, \nthen you cannot care, even if medical science \nis able to provide an answer. hellomynameis.org.uk; \n#hellomynameis\nImage and text reproduced courtesy of the \nfamily of Dr Kate Granger, MBE.", "text_length": 2009, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 526/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 525, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.080325", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.081057", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
