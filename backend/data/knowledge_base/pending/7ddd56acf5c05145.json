Importantly, there \nis no laterality to the visceral unmyelinated C-\ufb01 bre pain signals, which enter the \ncord bilaterally and at multiple levels. Division of the gut according to embryologi-\ncal origin is the important determinant here: see table 13.11.\nTable 13.11 Somatic referral of abdominal pain\nGut\nDivision points \nSomatic referral\nArterial supply\nFore\nProximal to 2nd part of duodenum\nEpigastrium\nCoeliac axis\nMid\nAbove to \u2154 along transverse colon\nPeriumbilical\nSuperior mesenteric\nHind Distal to above\nSuprapubic\nInferior mesenteric\nEarly in\ufb02 ammation irritates the structure and walls of the appendix, so a colicky \npain is referred to the mid-abdomen\u2014classically periumbilical.

In pneumo-\nnia, the T9 dermatome is shared by the lung and the abdomen.
