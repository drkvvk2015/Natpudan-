Obstruction may occur anywhere from the renal calyces to the \nurethral meatus, and may be partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Obstruct-\ning lesions are luminal (stones, blood clot, sloughed papilla, tumour: renal, ureteric, \nor bladder), mural (eg congenital or acquired stricture, neuromuscular dysfunction, \nschistosomiasis), or extra-mural (abdom inal or pelvic mass/tumour, retroperitoneal \n\ufb01 brosis, or iatrogenic\u2014eg post surgery). Unilateral obstruction may be clinically \nsilent (normal urine output and U&E) if the other kidney is functioning. \ue007Bilateral \nobstruction or obstruction with infection requires urgent treatment. See p641.\nClinical features\n  \n\u2022 Acute upper tract obstruction: Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be \nsuperimposed infection \u00b1 loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney.\n  \n\u2022 Chronic upper tract obstruction: Flank pain, renal failure, superimposed infection. \nPolyuria may occur due to impaired urinary concentration.\n  \u2022 Acute lower tract obstruction: Acute urinary retention typically presents with \nsevere suprapubic pain \u00b1 acute confusion (elderly); often acute on chronic (hence \npreceded by chronic symptoms , see next bullet point). Clinically: distended, palpable \nbladder containing ~600mL, dull to percussion. Causes include prostatic obstruction \n(usual cause in older \ue032), urethral strictures, anticholinergics, blood clots eg from \nbladder lesion (\u2018clot retention\u2019), alcohol, constipation, post-op (pain/in\ufb02 ammation/\nanaesthetics), infection (p296), neurological (cauda equina syndrome, see p466).\n  \n\u2022 Chronic lower tract obstruction: Symptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, poor \nstream, terminal dribbling, over\ufb02 ow incontinence. Signs: distended, palpable blad-\nder (capacity may be >1.5L) \u00b1 large prostate on PR. Complications: UTI, urinary \nretention, renal failure (eg bilateral obstructive uropathy\u2014see BOX \u2018Obstructive \nuropathy\u2019). Causes include prostatic enlargement (common); pelvic malignancy; \nrectal surgery; DM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2\u2013S4).\nTests Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-speci\ufb01 c antigen (PSA, p530).\n12 Urine: \nDipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p744) is the imaging modality of choice for investi-\ngating upper tract obstruction: If there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter (distension \nof the renal pelvis and calyces or ureter), arrange a CT scan. This will determine the \nlevel of obstuction. NB: in ~5% of cases of obstruction, no distension is seen on US. \nRadionuclide imaging enables functional assessment of the kidneys.\nTreatment Upper tract obstruction: Nephrostomy or ureteric stent. NB: stents may \ncause signi\ufb01 cant discomfort and patients should be warned of this and other risks \n(see BOX \u2018Problems of ureteric stenting\u2019). \ue025-blockers help reduce stent-related pain \n(\ue001ureteric spasm). Pyeloplasty, to widen the PUJ, may be performed for idiopathic \nPUJ obstruction.\nLower tract obstruction: Insert a urethral or suprapubic catheter (p762) to relieve \nacute retention. In chronic obstruction only catheterize patient if there is pain, uri-\nnary infection, or renal impairment; intermittent self-catheterization is sometimes \nrequired (p763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and \nbladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diure-\nsis (see BOX \u2018Obstructive uropathy\u2019). Monitor weight, \ufb02 uid balance, and U&E closely. \nTreat the underlying cause if possible, eg if prostatic obstruction, start an \ue025-blocker \n(see p642). After 2\u20133 days, trial without catheter (TWOC, p763) may work (especially \nif <75yrs old and <1L drained or retention was triggered by a passing event, eg GA). \n12 Do venepuncture for PSA before PR, as PR can \ue000 total PSA by ~1ng/mL (free PSA \ue000 by 10%). It\u2019s diffi  cult \nto know if acute retention raises PSA, but relieving obstruction does cause it to drop.", "text_length": 4158, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 648/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 647, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.290045", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.290929", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
