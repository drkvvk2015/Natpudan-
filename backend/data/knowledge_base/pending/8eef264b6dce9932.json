Consider\nceiling dose effect. Common side effects include gas\ntritis, gastric ulcer, hypertension, fluid retention, renal\ndysfunction (pre renal, AIN), impaired platelet function.\nCOX 2 inhibitors are associated with decreased risk of\ngastric ulceration and platelet dysfunction, but poten\ntially higher risk of cardiovascular events\nSECOND LINE (weak opioids)\ncodeine 30 60 mg\nPO q4h, acetaminophen/codeine 325 mg/30 mg 1 2\ntabs PO q4h, acetaminophen/hydrocodone` 325 mg/\n5 10 mg PO q4h, tramadol 50 100 mg PO q4 6h\nTHIRD LINE (strong opioids)\nmorphine 5 mg PO q4h\nand 2.5 mg q1h PRN, hydromorphone 2 mg PO q4h and\n1 mg q1h PRN, oxycodone 5 mg PO q4h and 2.5 mg\nq1h PRN, fentanyl (only if pain stable), methadone\nPROCEDURES\nsurgical interventions (celiac plexus/\nsplanchnic block, subarachnoid block, cordotomy,\nepidural/intrathecal infusion, vertebroplasty) may be\nadded to any line as needed\nADJUVANT THERAPIES\n\u0002\nMEDICATIONS\nMITIGATING\nADVERSE\nEFFECTS\nOF\nOPIOIDS\nstart bowel protocol (senna 2 tab PO\nqhs) and anti nausea (metoclopramide 10 mg PO\nq4h) at the same time of opioids. Methylphenidate\n5 10 mg PO qAM and 5 10 mg qnoon may be\nused for opioid sedation\n\u0002\nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (neuropathic pain)\nnor\ntriptyline 25 mg PO qhs initially, increase by 25 mg/\nday every week if tolerated, target 75 mg PO qhs BID\n\u0002\nANTICONVULSANTS\n(neuropathic\npain,\nopioid\ninduced myoclonus)\ngabapentin 100 300 mg\nPO TID, pregabalin 100 mg PO TID, carbamazepine\n100 mg PO BID, phenytoin 100 mg PO TID\n\u0002\nANTISPASMODICS\nbaclofen 10 mg PO TID muscle\nfor spasms\n\u0002\nANTINEOPLASTIC TREATMENTS (cancer pain)\nchemother\napy, radiation (external beam radiation for focal\ntumor infiltration, Strontium89, or Samarium153\nfor multifocal osteoblastic bone metastases), hor\nmonal agents\n\u0002\nBISPHOSPHONATES (bone metastases, hypercalce\nmia)\npamidronate 60 90 mg in 500 mL NS IV\nover 4 6 h, zoledronate 4 mg IV\nMANAGEMENT (CONT\u2019D)\n\u0002\nCORTICOSTEROIDS (acute nerve/spinal cord compres\nsion, visceral distension, increased intracranial pres\nsure, and soft tissue infiltration)\ndexametha\nsone 8 10 mg PO BID\nOTHERS\nphysical therapy (massage, acupuncture,\ntrigger point injection), psychological therapy (relaxa\ntion, imagery, biofeedback)\nTREATMENT ISSUES\nOPIOID USE\n\u0002\nSTARTING DOSE\nstart with short acting opioids,\nwhich are usually given q4h around the clock,\nwith breakthroughs (10 20% of total daily dose)\ngiven q1 2h (see table below). Need to increase\nscheduled dose if \u00033 breakthroughs/day\n\u0002\nROUTE\nfor regular opioids, PO is preferred over\nSC/IV. IV/SC dose = \u00bd of PO dose for most opioids\n\u0002\nMAXIMUM DOSE\nthere is no absolute number for\nthe ceiling dose of opioids that can be given. This is\nonly limited by opioid toxicity\n\u0002\nMAINTENANCE\nif patient on stable dose of opioids,\nmay consider switching to slow release (SR)\nformulations or fentanyl patch for convenience\nand improved compliance. Long acting opioids\nprovide similar pain control as short acting opioids\n\u0002\nTITRATING DOWN\nif patient did not require any\nrescue opioids and pain is well controlled, consider\ndecreasing regular dose by 25 50% every 1 7\ndays to optimally control pain with minimum\nopioid dose\n\u0002\nCAUTIONS\navoid meperidine because of high toxi\ncity from metabolites. Avoid fentanyl patch for\nunstable pain (although fentanyl infusion can be\nuseful)\nOPIOID TOXICITY\n\u0002\nADVERSE\nEFFECTS\ncommon side effects include\nnausea, somnolence, dry mouth, pruritus, and con\nstipation. While these side effects generally resolve\nwithin a few days, patients do not develop tolerance\nto\nconstipation\nand\nwould\nrequire\nlaxatives\nthroughout opioid treatment. Patients receiving\nhigh doses of opioids may develop neurotoxicity,\nwhich include myoclonus, hyperalgesia, delirium,\nhallucinations, cognitive impairment, and respira\ntory depression. Long term side effects include\nhypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis,\nimmunosuppression, altered renal function, and\nperipheral edema. Methadone is also associated\nwith QT prolongation at high doses\n\u0002\nTREATMENT OF OPIOID TOXICITIES\nensure adequate\nhydration, opioid rotation, exclude underlying\naggravating metabolic factors (uremia, liver fail\nure, hypercalcemia), and symptom management\n(e.g. treat nausea and constipation)\n392\nPrinciples of Pain Control", "text_length": 4815, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 398/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 397, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.796848", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.797740", "status": "pending"}
