AML) fall ill suddenly and deteriorate fast, eg with: \n\ue022infection, \ue022ble eding (\ue014: platelets \u00b1 FFP), and \ue022hyperviscosity (p372). Take \nnon-speci\ufb01 c confusion/drowsiness or just \u2018I feel a bit ill today\u2019 seriously: do blood \ncultures, FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca\n2+, glucose, and clotting. Consider CNS bleeding\u2014CT if in \ndoubt. With any new patient, \ufb01 nd out the agreed aim of treatment: cure; prolong-\ning disease-free survival; or palliation with minimal toxicity? Direct your eff orts \naccordingly; get help if lack of clarity here.\nNeutropenic regimen (For when neutrophil count \u22640.5 \u2248 10\n9/L.)3 \ue007Close liaison \nwith a microbiologist and haematologist is vital. Abide by infection control proce-\ndures! Use a risk-assessment tool (eg MASCC, see BOX). \n  \n\u2022 Full barrier nursing in a side room if possible. Hand-washing is vital.\n  \n\u2022 Avoid IM injections (danger of an infected haematoma).\n  \n\u2022 Look for infection (mouth, axillae, perineum, IVI site). Take swabs.\n  \n\u2022 Check: FBC, platelets, INR, U&E, LFT, LDH, CRP. Take cultures (blood \u22483\u2014peripherally \n\u00b1 Hickman line; urine, sputum, stool if diarrhoea); CXR if clinically indicated.\n  \n\u2022 Wash perineum after defecation. Swab moist skin with chlorhexidine. Avoid \nunnecessary rectal examinations. Oral hygiene (eg hydrogen peroxide mouth \nwashes/2h) and Candida prophylaxis are important (p246).\n  \n\u2022 Check vital signs 4-hrly. High-calorie diet; avoid foods with high risk of microbial \ncontamination. Vases containing cut \ufb02 owers pose a Pseudomonas risk.\nUse of antibiotics in neutropenia \ue007Treat any known infection promptly.\n  \n\u2022 If T\u00b0 >38\u00b0C or T\u00b0 >37.5\u00b0C on two occasions, >1h apart, or the patient is septic, \nstart blind combination therapy according to local guidelines\u2014eg piperacillin\u2013\ntazobactam\u2014p386 (+ vancomycin, p386, if Gram +ve organisms suspected or iso-\nlated, eg Hickman line sepsis). Continue until afebrile for 72h or 5d course, and \nuntil neutro phils >0.5\u224810\n9/L. If fever persists despite antibiotics, think of CMV, \nfungi (eg Candida; Aspergillus, p408) and central line infection.\n  \u2022 Consider treatment for Pneumocystis (p400, eg co-trimoxazole, though beware as \nthis can worsen neutropenia). Remember TB.\nOther dangers \u2022Tumour lysis syndrome: Results in \ue000K\n+, \ue000 urate, and AKI. See p529.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperviscosity: (p372). If WCC is >100 \u2248 10\n9/L WBC thrombi may form in brain, \nlung, and heart (leukostasis). Avoid transfusing before lowering WCC, eg with \nhydroxycarbamide or leukaph eresis, as viscosity rises (\ue000risk of leukostasis).\n  \n\u2022 DIC: The release of procoagulants into the circulation causes widespread activa-\ntion of coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets and causing \ue000risk of \nbleeding. Fibrin strands \ufb01 ll small vessels, haemolysing passing RBCs. Fibrinolysis \nis also activated. Causes: Malignancy, sepsis, trauma, obstetric events. Signs: \n(\ufb01 g 8.44) Bruising, bleeding anywhere (eg vene puncture sites), renal failure. \nTests: \ue001Platelets; \ue000PT; \ue000APTT; \ue001\ufb01 brinogen (correlates with severity); \ue000\ue000\ufb01 brin degra-\ndation products (D-dimers). Film: broken RBCS (schisto cytes). \ue057: Treat the cause. \nReplace platelets if <50\u224810\n9/L, cryoprecipitate to replace \ufb01 brinogen, FFP to re-\nplace coagulation factors. Heparin is controversial. The use of all-transretinoic \nacid (ATRA) has signi\ufb01 cantly reduced the risk of DIC in acute pro myelocytic leu-\nkaemia (the commonest leukaemia associated with DIC).\n  \n\u2022 Preventing sepsis: Give \ufb02 uoroquinolone (eg cipro\ufb02 oxacin) before neutropenia gets \nserious. Granulocyte colony stimulators (G-CSF) can increase the production of WBCs \n(granulocytes) from bone marrow, but should not be given routinely in chemo-\ntherapy.
