Mechanical or motility related? (See BOX \n\u2018Causes of dysphagia\u2019.)\nFive key questions to ask\n1   Was there diffi  culty swallowing solids and liquids from the start?\nYes: motility disorder (eg achalasia, CNS, or pharyngeal causes).\nNo: Solids then liquids: suspect a stricture (benign or malignant).\n2   Is it diffi  cult to initiate a swallowing movement?\nYes: Suspect bulbar palsy, especially if patient coughs on swallowing.\n3   Is swallowing painful (odynophagia)?\nYes: Suspect ulceration (malignancy, oesophagitis, viral infection or Candida in \nimmunocompromised, or poor steroid inhaler technique) or spasm.\n4   Is the dysphagia intermittent or is it constant and getting worse?\nIntermittent: suspect oesophageal spasm.\nConstant and worsening: suspect malignant stricture.\n5   Does the neck bulge or gurgle on drinking?\nYes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570).\nSigns Is the patient cachectic or anaemic? Examine the mouth; feel for supraclavic-\nular nodes (left supraclavicular node = Virchow\u2019s node\u2014suggests intra-abdominal ma-\nlignancy); look for signs of systemic disease, eg systemic sclerosis (p552), CNS disease.\nTests FBC (anaemia); U&E (dehydration). Upper GI endoscopy \u00b1 biopsy (\ufb01 g 6.13). If suspi-\ncion of pharyngeal pouch consider contrast swallow (\u00b1 ENT opinion). Video \ufb02 uoroscopy \nmay help identify neurogenic causes. Oesophageal manometry for dysmotility.\nSpeci\ufb01 c conditions Oesophagitis: See p254. Diffuse oesophageal spasm: Causes in-\ntermittent dysphagia \u00b1 chest pain. Contrast swallow/manometry: abnormal contrac-\ntions.\n5 Achalasia: Coordinated peristalsis is lost and the lower oesophageal sphincter \nfails to relax (due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus), causing dysphagia, re-\ngurgitation, and \ue001weight. Characteristic \ufb01 ndings on manometry or contrast swallow \nshowing dilated tapering oesophagus. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation, or \nHeller\u2019s cardiomyotomy\u2014then proton pump inhibitors (PPIS, p254). Botulinum toxin in-\njection if a non-invasive procedure is needed (repeat every few months). Calcium chan-\nnel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture: \nCaused by gastro-oesophageal re\ufb02 ux (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy. \nTreatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal cancer: (p618.) Associations: \n\ue032, GORD, tobacco, alcohol, Barrett\u2019s oesophagus (p695), tylosis (palmar hyperkeratosis), \nPlummer\u2013Vinson syndrome (post-cricoid dysphagia, upper oesophageal web + iron-\nde\ufb01 ciency). CNS causes: Ask for help from a speech and language therapist.\nNausea and vomiting\nConsider pregnancy where appropriate! Other causes, p56.\nWhat\u2019s in the vomit? Reports of \u2018coff ee grounds\u2019 may indicate upper GI bleeding \nbut represent one of the most over-called signs in clinical medicine \u2014 always verify \nyourself and look for other evidence of GI bleeding; recognizable food \u2248 gastric stasis; \nfeculent \u2248 small bowel obstruction.\nTiming Morning \u2248 pregnancy or \ue000ICP; 1h post food \u2248 gastric stasis/gastroparesis (DM); \nvomiting that relieves pain \u2248 peptic ulcer; preceded by loud gurgling \u2248 GI obstruction.\nTests Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca\n2+, glucose, amylase. ABG: A metabolic (hypochlor-\naemic) alkalosis from loss of gastric contents (pH >7.45, \ue000HCO3 \n\u03a9) indicates severe \nvomiting. Plain AXR: If suspected bowel obstruction (p728). Upper GI endoscopy: \n(See p248.) If suspicion of bleed or persistent vomiting. Consider head CT in case \ue000ICP.\nTreatment Identify and treat underlying causes. Symptomatic relief: table 6.4. Be \npre-emptive, eg pre-op for post-op symptoms. Try oral route \ufb01 rst. 30% need a 2nd-line \nanti-emetic, so be prepared to prescribe more than one.
