This group face a greater risk of post-\noperative infection and cardiac complications. Tight glycaemic control is therefore \nessential and improves outcome. Aim to achieve an HbA1C of <69mmol/mol prior to \nelective surgery. Patients are often well informed about their diabetes\u2014involve them \nfully in managing their diabetic care. Check your hospital\u2019s policy for managing dia-\nbetic patients who will be NBM before surgery. A general guide follows.\nInsulin-treated diabetes mellitus\n  \n\u2022 Try to place the patient \ufb01 rst on the list in order to minimize the fasting period.\n  \n\u2022 Give all usual insulin the night before surgery.\n  \u2022 Long-acting (basal) insulin is usually continued at normal times (eg glargine; de-\ntemir), even when patients are on a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)\u2014\npreviously known as a \u2018sliding scale\u2019 (see BOX).\n  \n\u2022 If on AM list, ensure no subcutaneous rapid-acting (bolus) or mixed insulin is given \non the morning of surgery. If PM list, give the normal morning bolus insulin, or half \nthe mixed insulin dose.\n  \n\u2022 If eating and drinking post-operatively, resume the usual insulin with evening meal. \nIf AM list (or early PM) and eating a late lunch, give half the morning insulin dose \nwith this meal. If not eating until evening, a VRIII may be needed if the capillary \nglucose readings are high.\n  \n\u2022 Omit all rapid-acting and mixed insulin while the patient is on a VRIII.\n  \n\u2022 It not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hrs prior to surgery. Aim for serum \nglucose levels of 6\u201310mmol/L and check \ufb01 nger-prick glucose every 2 hrs. When \nready to eat, give normal dose of rapid acting or mixed insulin with the 1st meal \nand stop the VRIII 30\u201360min later.\n  \n\u2022 IV \ufb02 uid is required while the patient is on a VRIII: see BOX.\n  \n\u2022 A glucose\u2013potassium\u2013insulin (GKI) infusion can be used as an alternative to a VRIII, \nalthough it is no longer used as standard in the UK.\nTablet-treated diabetes mellitus\n  \n\u2022 If diabetes is poorly controlled (eg fasting glucose >10mmol/L), treat as for \n patients on insulin (see earlier in topic).\n  \n\u2022 Give usual medications the night before surgery, except long-acting sulfonylureas \n(eg glibenclamide) which can cause prolonged hypoglycaemia when fasting and \nmay need to be substituted 2\u20133 days pre-operatively. Discuss with the diabetes team.\n  \n\u2022 If eating and drinking post-operatively: on AM list, omit morning medication and \ntake any missed drugs with lunch, after surgery. If PM list, take normal medications \nwith breakfast, omit midday doses, and take any missed drugs with a late lunch. \nThe dose of these may need reducing, depending on dietary intake.\n  \n\u2022 If not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hours prior to surgery. Once eating \nand drinking, oral hypoglycaemics can be restarted.\n  \n\u2022 Some patients may need a phase of subcutaneous insulin following major sur-\ngery\u2014refer to the diabetes team if serum glucose levels are persistently raised.\n  \n\u2022 Metformin and iodine IV contrast: Metformin can be continued after IV contrast \nin patients with normal serum creatinine and/or eGFR >60mL/min. To minimize the \nrisk of nephrotoxicity, if serum creatinine is raised or eGFR <60mL/min, stop met-\nformin for 48h after contrast and check renal function has returned to baseline \nbefore restarting.\nDiet-controlled diabetes There are usually no problems; patients should be treated \nas if not diabetic (and do not need to be \ufb01 rst on the list). Check capillary blood \nglucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases blood glucose levels.\nPeri-operative morbidity and mortality Diabetes mellitus is classed as an inter-\nmediate risk factor for increased peri-operative cardiovascular risk by the American \nHeart Association, so screen for the presence of asymptomatic cardiac and renal \ndisease (p567) and be aware of possible \u2018silent\u2019 myocardial ischaemia. Long-term \npost-op survival has been found to be poorer for patients with diabetes; however, \nperi-operative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were only increased in the \npresence of congestive heart failure and haemodialysis\u2014ie not diabetes alone.", "text_length": 4306, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 596/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 595, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.204986", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.205892", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
