Expose the arms, then ask the patient to rest their hands on a pillow. \nStart by examining the dorsal surface and then turn the hands over. Always ask \nabout pain or tender areas. Follow the \u2018look, ask the patient to move, then feel\u2019 to \navoid causing pain.\nNails\nLook for the same skin changes \nas the palm, plus tendon xan-\nthomata, plaques, and joint re-\nplacement scars, and examine \nthe nails for:\n  \n\u2022 Pitting and onycholysis (p76).\n  \n\u2022 Clubbing (p77).\n  \n\u2022 Nail fold infarcts and splinter \nhaemorrhages.\n  \n\u2022 Other lesions, eg Beau\u2019s lines \n(\ufb01 g 2.41, p76), koilonychia, \nleuconychia (\ufb01 g 2.36).\nMuscles\nExamine the muscles for wasting and fascicu-\nlations; on the dorsal surface look for wasting, \nparticularly of dorsal interossei. On the palm \nlook particularly at the thenar and hypothenar \neminences.\n  \n\u2022 Thenar wasting (\ufb01 g 2.37) = median nerve \nlesion.\n  \n\u2022 Generalized wasting, particularly of the \ninterossei on the dorsum, but sparing of the \nthenar eminence = ulnar nerve lesion.\nAlso look for Dupuytren's contracture and \nperform Tinel's test (percuss over the distal \nskin crease of the wrist). Phalen's test (patient \nholds dorsal surfaces of both hands together \nfor 60 seconds). Both tests are positive if tin-\ngling reported, suggesting carpal tunnel syn-\ndrome.\nFig 2.35 Gouty tophi.\nFig 2.36 Leuconychia.\nFig 2.37 Thenar wasting.", "text_length": 1955, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 86/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 85, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.010117", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.010867", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
