Routine examination for those at \nrisk (CD4<100 cells/microlitre). Diagnosis: clinical. Fundos-\ncopy: granular white dots, haemorrhage (\ufb01 g 9.49). Can \nprogress to an arcuate/triangular zone of infection, or can \nbe linear following vessels/nerve \ufb01 bres. Treatment: sys-\ntemic valganciclovir (oral, IV). Also ganciclovir, foscarnet, \ncidofovir. ART if underlying HIV (see p402).\n  \n\u2022 Ocular toxoplasmosis:\nCauses posterior uveitis. Presentation: blurred vision/\n\ufb02 oaters. Diagnosis: clinical. Fundoscopy (\ufb01 g 9.50): focus \nof choroiditis, chorioretinal scar from previous infection, \noverlying vitreal haze due to in\ufb02 ammatory response. \nMultiple/bilateral/extensive lesions if \ue000 immunosuppression. Serology. Ocular \ufb02 uid \nPCR. Treatment: atovaquone (\ue001toxicity), sulfadiazine, and pyrimethamine.\nFig 9.50 Retinal toxoplas-\nmosis.                        \u00a9Prof Trobe.\nOnchocerciasis (\u2018river blindness\u2019)\nCaused by \ufb01 larial worm, Onchocerca volvulus. Transmitted by the bite of infected \nblack \ufb02 ies which breed in fast-\ufb02 owing rivers and streams. Second most com-\nmon infectious cause of blindness worldwide: predominantly sub-Saharan Africa, \nBrazil, Venezuela, Yemen. Presentation: A nodule forms at the site of the bite \nwhere larvae mature to adult worms. The female adult can release up to 1000 \nmicro\ufb01 lariae/day causing:\n  \n\u2022 skin disease: altered pigment ation, licheni\ufb01 cation, loss of elasticity, poor healing\n  \n\u2022 eye disease: keratitis, uveitis, cataract, \ufb01 xed pupil, fundal degeneration, optic \nneuritis/atrophy, visual impairment/loss (\ufb01 g 9.51)\n  \n\u2022 impaired lymphatic function: lymphadenopathy, elephantiasis.\nDiagnosis: Visualization of micro\ufb01 laria in eye or on skin snip biopsy: a \ufb01 ne shav-\ning of clean skin is incubated in 0.9% saline to allow micro\ufb01 lariae to emerge for \nmicroscopic identi\ufb01 cation. Serology. Treatment: Ivermectin 150mcg/kg, one dose \nevery 3\u201312 months (depending on likely re-exposure). CI if coexisting Loa-Loa due \nto risk of fatal encephalitic reaction. Or 6wk doxycycline. No vaccine available.\nLoiasis (African eye-worm)\nCaused by parasitic worm Loa loa. Transmitted via bite of deer\ufb02 ies (=mangrove/\nmango \ufb02 ies) which breed in rainforests of west and central Africa. Presenta-\ntion: Recurrent pruritic lesions due to angioedema (\u2018Calabar swellings\u2019), myalgia, \narthralgia. The adult worm can migrate through subcutaneous (\ufb01 g 9.52) and sub-\nconjunctival (\ufb01 g 9.53) tissue: \u2018Something\u2019s wiggling in my eye, doctor\u2019. This eerie \neye trip causes intense conjunctivitis, which heals if left alone. (Don\u2019t treat until \ntransmigration in the eye is over: on detecting your therapy the worm tends to \npanic.) Also causes glomerulonephritis, and encephalitis. Diagnosis : Micro\ufb01 lar-\niae on blood smear, serology, PCR. Eosinophilia. Treatment: Diethylcarbamazine \n(DEC) kills both micro\ufb01 lariae and adult worms. Risk of encephalopathy is related \nto micro\ufb01 larial load: albendazole can be used to \ue001 micro\ufb01 larial load prior to DEC \n(response may be slow).\n\ue007See also lymphatic \ufb01 lariasis p421.\nFilarial infection\nFig 9.51 Bilateral sclerosing \nkeratitis \nin \nonchocerciasis \ncausing blindness.\nReproduced from Warrell et al. \nOxford Textbook of Medicine, \n2010, with permission from \nOxford University Press.\nFig 9.52 Migrating Loa loa \nin the skin.\nReproduced from Warrell et al. \nOxford Textbook of Medicine, \n2010, with permission from \nOxford University Press.\nFig 9.53 Loa loa crossing the \nconjunctiva.\nReproduced from Warrell et al. \nOxford Textbook of Medicine, \n2010, with permission from \nOxford University Press.", "text_length": 3675, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 447/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 446, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.939417", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.940018", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
