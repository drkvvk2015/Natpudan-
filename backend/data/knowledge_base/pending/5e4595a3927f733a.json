Ensures the patient under-\nstands the nature, aims, and expected outcome of surgery. To allay anxiety and pain:\n  \n\u2022 Ensure that the right patient gets the right surgery. Have the symptoms and signs \nchanged? If so, inform the surgeon.\n  \n\u2022 Assess/balance risks of anaesthesia, and maximize \ufb01 tness. Comorbidities? Drugs? \nSmoker? Optimizing oxygenation before major surgery improves outcome.\n  \n\u2022 Obtain informed consent (p568).\n  \n\u2022 Check proposed anaesthesia/analgesia with anaesthetist.\nFamily history May be relevant, eg in malignant hyperpyrexia (p572); dystrophia \nmyotonica (p510); porphyria; cholinesterase problems; sickle-cell disease.\nDrugs Any drug/plaster/antiseptic allergies? \ue007Inform the anaesthetist about all \ndrugs even if \u2018over-the-counter\u2019. \ue007Steroids: see p590; diabetes: see p588.\n  \n\u2022 Antibiotics: Tetracycline and neomycin may \ue000 neuromuscular blockade.\n  \n\u2022 Anticoagulants: \ue007Tell the surgeon. Avoid epidural, spinal, and regional blocks. \nAspirin should probably be continued unless there is a major risk of bleeding. Dis-\ncuss stopping clopidogrel therapy with the cardiologists/neurologists. See p590.\n  \n\u2022 Anticonvulsants: Give as usual pre-op. Post-op, give drugs IV (or by NGT) until able \nto take orally. Valproate: give usual dose IV. Phenytoin: give IV slowly (<50mg/min, \non cardiac monitor). IM phenytoin absorption is unreliable.\n  \n\u2022 \ue058-blockers: Continue up to and including the day of surgery as this precludes a \nlabile cardiovascular response.\n  \n\u2022 Contraceptive pill: See BNF. Stop 4wks before major/leg surgery; ensure alterna-\ntive contraception is used. Restart 2wks after surgery, provided patient is mobile.\n  \n\u2022 Digoxin: Continue up to and including morning of surgery. Check for toxicity (ECG; \nplasma level); do plasma K\n+ and Ca\n2+ (suxamethonium can \ue000K\n+ and lead to ventricu-\nlar arrhythmias in the fully digitalized).\n  \n\u2022 Diuretics: Beware hypokalaemia, dehydration. Do U&E (and bicarbonate).\n  \n\u2022 Eye-dr ops: \ue020-blockers get systemically absorbed.\n  \n\u2022 HRT: As with contraceptive pill there may be an increased risk of DVT/PE.\n  \n\u2022 Levodopa: Possible arrhythmias when patient under GA.\n  \n\u2022 Lithium: Get expert help; may potentiate neuromuscular blockade and cause ar-\nrhythmias. See OHCS p349.\n  \u2022 MAOIS: Get expert help as interactions may cause hypotensive/hypertensive crises.\n  \n\u2022 Thyroid medication: see p600.\n  \n\u2022 Tricyclics: These enhance adrenaline (epinephrine) and arrhythmias.\nPreparation \ue007Starve patient; NBM \u22652h pre-op for clear \ufb02 uids and \u22656h for solids.1\n  \n\u2022 Is any bowel or skin preparation needed, or prophylactic antibiotics (p570)?\n  \n\u2022 Start DVT prophylaxis as indicated, eg graduated compression stockings (CI in pe-\nripheral arterial disease); LMWH (p350): eg moderate risk, 20mg ~2h pre-op then \n20mg/24h; high risk (eg orthopaedic surgery), 40mg 12h pre-op then 40mg/24h; \nor heparin 5000U SC 2h pre-op, then every 8\u201312h SC for 7d or until ambulant.\n  \n\u2022 Ensure necessary premedications (p572), regular medications, analgesia, anti-\nemetics, antibiotics are all prescribed as appropriate. Con\ufb01 rm NBM.\n  \n\u2022 Book any pre-, intra-, or post-operative x-rays or frozen sections.\n  \n\u2022 Book post-operative physiotherapy.\n  \n\u2022 If needed, site IV cannula, catheterize (p762), and/or insert a Ryle\u2019s tube (p759).\n  \n\u2022 Meta-analyses have shown no bene\ufb01 t to patients from mechanical bowel cleansing \nbefore colonic surgery\u2014this is no longer considered good practice. There is also no \nevidence for the use of enemas prior to rectal surgery.", "text_length": 3664, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 574/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 573, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.162794", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.163662", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
