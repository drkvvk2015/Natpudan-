This may be normal and asympto-\nmatic in very \ufb01 t, young individuals whose high stroke volumes will maintain ad-\nequate cardiac output at low heart rates.\nSymptoms Often asymptomatic. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness. The presence of synco-\npe, chest pain, or breathlessness is concerning and suggests the presence of adverse \nsigns; sudden cardiac death can occur.\nRhythm The immediate management tends to relate more to cause and adverse \nsigns than to the underlying rhythm, which may be \u2022sinus bradycardia \u2022heart block \n(see p98) \u2022AF with a slow ventricular response \u2022atrial \ufb02 utter with a high-degree \nblock \u2022junctional bradycardia.\nCauses\n  \n\u2022 Physiological: Heart rates as low as 40bpm at rest and 30bpm in sleep can be ac-\ncepted in asymptomatic trained athletes.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac:\n  \n\u2022 Degenerative changes causing \ufb01 brosis of conduction pathways (risk in elderly \npatients; may have previous ECGs showing bundle branch block or 1st- or 2nd-\ndegree heart block).\n  \n\u2022 Post-MI\u2014particularly after an inferior MI (the right coronary artery supplies the \nsinoatrial node and atrioventricular node in most people).\n  \n\u2022 Sick sinus syndrome (p125).\n  \n\u2022 Iatrogenic\u2014ablation, surgery.\n  \n\u2022 Aortic valve disease, eg infective endocarditis (p150; do daily ECGs looking for \nheart block).\n  \n\u2022 Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, amyloid, sarcoid, SLE.\n  \n\u2022 Non-cardiac origin:\n  \n\u2022 Vasovagal\u2014very common (p460).\n  \n\u2022 Endocrine\u2014hypothyroidism, adrenal insuffi  ciency.\n  \n\u2022 Metabolic\u2014hyperkalaemia, hypoxia.\n  \n\u2022 Other\u2014hypothermia, \ue000ICP (Cushing\u2019s triad: bradycardia, hypertension, and ir-\nregular breathing: \ue022 urgent senior input needed).\n  \n\u2022 Drug-induced:\n  \n\u2022 \ue020-blockers, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin.\nManagement \ue007Follow a logical approach,6 see \ufb01 g 19.11. 6\n\ue022Think ahead. If you may need an anaesthetist to sedate the patient for transcuta-\nneous pacing, or a cardiologist for transvenous pacing, call them now.\n  \n\u2022 Perform a 12-lead ECG, check electrolytes (including K\n+, Ca\n2+, Mg\n2+), do digoxin levels.\n  \n\u2022 Connect patient to cardiac monitor/telemetry.\n  \n\u2022 Address the cause: correct metabolic defects; if the patient has adverse signs or is \ndeteriorating, give antidotes to medicines likely to have caused the bradycardia (eg \nglucagon if \ue020-blocker overdose).\n  \n\u2022 If the patient has adverse signs or risk of asystole, give atropine (not to be given if \npatient has a transplanted heart).\n  \n\u2022 If atropine is insuffi  cient and adverse signs persist, transcutaneous pacing should \nbe considered (p777). If this cannot be initiated immediately (eg waiting for an \nanaesthetist), consider other medications such as isoprenaline infusion.\n  \n\u2022 Remember electrical \u2018capture\u2019 with transcutaneous pacing does not guarantee me-\nchanical \u2018capture\u2019. Once pacing is established, check the patient\u2019s pulse.\n\ue007It is possible to have two patients sat next to each other with identical bradycardic \nECG tracings, one of whom is peri-arrest, the other is sat comfortably and cannot \nunderstand your concern.
