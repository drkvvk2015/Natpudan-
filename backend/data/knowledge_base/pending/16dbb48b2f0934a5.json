This leads to progressive immune system dysfunction, opportun-\nistic infection, and malignancy = Acquired Immunode\ufb01 ciency Syndrome (AIDS). The \nvirus is transmitted via blood, sexual \ufb02 uids, and breast milk. Virus subtypes include \nHIV1 (global epidemic) and HIV2 (\ue001 pathogenic, predominantly West Africa).\nEpidemiology\n~37 million adults and children are estimated to be living with HIV worldwide (\ufb01 g \n9.11), with 1.2 million deaths/yr. Africa has most of the disease (~26 million), most \nof the mortality (790 000/yr), and ~1% of the world\u2019s wealth.\nUK: estimated ~100 000 living with HIV (=1.9/1000) including 5% of men who have sex \nwith men (MSM). ~17% of those with HIV in UK are unaware of their infection.\nPathophysiology\nHIV binds, via its GP120 envelope glycoprotein, to CD4 receptors on helper T cells, \nmonocytes, and macrophages. These \u2018CD4 cells\u2019 migrate to lymphoid tissue where \nthe virus replicates, producing billions of new virions. These are released, and in turn \ninfect new CD4 cells. As infection progresses, depletion or impaired function of CD4 \ncells leads to \ue001immune function. HIV is a retrovirus: it encodes reverse transcriptase, \nallowing DNA copies to be produced from viral RNA. This is error prone, meaning a \nsigni\ufb01 cant mutation rate, which contributes to treatment resistance.\nPrevention\nSexual transmission: Consistent and correct use of (male and female) condoms \n\ue001 transmission by ~90%. Serosorting is the restriction of (unprotected) sex depend-\ning on HIV status. It is unsafe due to inaccuracies in HIV status (which is only as \nreliable as a person\u2019s last test) and failure to disclose. It does not consider transfer of \ntreatment resistance, other STIs, or hepatitis.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): The short-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) \nafter potential HIV exposure (sexual or occupational) should be considered an emer-\ngency method of HIV prevention. Can be given up to 72h (ideally <24h) after exposure. \nNot recommended if exposure is to a person on ART with a con\ufb01 rmed and sustained \n(>6 months) undetectable (<200 copies/mL) viral load. 1st-line PEP6 in UK is Truvada\u00ae \n(tenofovir/emtricitabine) and raltegravir for 28 days (2015) (refer to local guidelines). \nTest for HIV 8\u201312 weeks after exposure.\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): The use of ART in those at high risk of acquiring HIV \nincluding serodiff erent relationships without suppression of viral load, condomless \nanal sex in MSM. Trials (PROUD, IPERGAY) show an 86% reduction in HIV incidence. A \nlarge scale trial of PrEP provision (2017\u20132020) will inform future NHS funding decisions.\nVertical transmission: All pregnant women with HIV should have commenced ART \nby 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. Caesarean delivery indicated if viral load >50 copies/mL. \nNeonatal PEP is given from birth to 4wks old with formula-feeding.\nFig 9.11 Adult HIV prevalence (15\u201349 years).\nReproduced with permission from World Health Organization, \u2018Adult HIV prevalence (15\u201349 years), 2015 by \nWHO region\u2019. \u00a9World Health Organization 2016.\nhttp://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/HIV_adult_prevalence_2015.png.", "text_length": 3364, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 406/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 405, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.871296", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.872044", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
