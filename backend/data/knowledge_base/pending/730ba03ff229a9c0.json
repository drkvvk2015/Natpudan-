Monthly visual check if treat-\nment > 2 months. Monitor levels if eGFR<30.\nLatent TB:\nOff er testing3  to close contacts of those with pulmonary or laryngeal TB, those \nwith immune dysfunction, healthcare workers, and high-risk populations, eg pris-\non, homeless, vulnerable migrants.\n  \n\u2022 Tuberculin skin testing (TST) = Mantoux test. Intradermal injection of puri\ufb01 ed \nprotein derivative (PPD) tuberculin. Size of skin induration is used to determine \npositivity depending on vaccination history and immune status (>5mm if risk \nfactors, >15mm if no risk factors).\n  \n\u2022 Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAS) diagnose exposure to TB by meas-\nuring the release of interferon-gamma from T-cells reacting to TB antigen. \n\ue000Speci\ufb01 city compared to TST if history of BCG vaccination.\n\ue007Neither test can diagnose or exclude active disease (falsely negative in 20\u201325% \nof active disease): clinical evaluation is required.\n\ue007Immune-suppressed states reduce the sensitivity of both tests.\nActive pulmonary TB:\n  \n\u2022 CXR. Fibronodular/linear opacities in upper lobe (typical), middle or lower lobes \n(atypical), cavitation, calci\ufb01 cation, miliary disease (see \ufb01 g 9.9), eff usion, lym-\nphadenopathy.\n  \n\u2022 Sputum smear. Sputum can be spontaneously produced or induced (with nebu-\nlized saline and precautions to prevent transmission). Three specimens are need-\ned including an early-morning sample. It is stained for the presence of acid-fast \nbacilli (AFB). All mycobacteria are \u2018acid-fast\u2019 including M. tuberculosis. If AFB are \nseen, treatment should be commenced and the patient isolated (in hospital only \nif clinical indication, or public health reason for admission; or at home).\n  \n\u2022 Sputum culture. More sensitive than smear testing. Culture takes 1\u20133 weeks \n(liquid media) or 4\u20138 weeks (solid media). Can assess drug sensitivity.\n  \n\u2022 Nucleic acid ampli\ufb01 cation test (NAAT). Direct detection of M. tuberculosis in \nsputum by DNA or RNA ampli\ufb01 cation. Rapid diagnosis (<8hrs). Can also detect \ndrug resistance (see p395).\nExtra-pulmonary TB:\n  \n\u2022 Investigate for coexisting pulmonary disease.\n  \n\u2022 Obtain material from aspiration or biopsy (lymph node, pleura, bone, synovium, \nGI/GU tract) to enable AFB staining, histological examination (caseating granu-\nloma) and/or culture.\n  \n\u2022 NAAT can be carried out on any sterile body \ufb02 uid, eg CSF, pericardial \ufb02 uid.\n\ue022Offer HIV test for all. \nDiagnostic tests for TB\nTuberculosis (TB): diagnosis and treatment", "text_length": 3418, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 402/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 401, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.863860", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.864719", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
