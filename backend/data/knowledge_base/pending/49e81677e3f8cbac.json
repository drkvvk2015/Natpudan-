Even in the emergency department where \nthe history may be brief, eg \u2018trauma\u2019, the examination is to con\ufb01 rm a fracture, or to \ndecide that a fracture is less likely. The examination sheds further light on the his-\ntory. As you get better, your physical examination gets briefer. Establish your own \nroutine\u2014practice is the key.\nEnd of the bed\n  \n\u2022 Look at the patient\u2014are they well or in extremis? What makes you think this? \nAre they in pain? If so, does it make them lie still (eg peritonitis) or writhe about \n(eg colic)? What is the pattern of breathing: laboured; rapid; shallow; irregular; \ndistressed? Are they obese or cachectic? Is their behaviour appropriate? Can you \ndetect any unusual smell, eg hepatic fetor (p274), cigarettes, alcohol?\n  \n\u2022 Also take a moment to look around the bed for other clues, eg inhalers, insulin \nadministration kit, walking aids, etc.\nFace and body habitus\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient\u2019s appearance suggest any particular diseases, eg acromegaly, thy-\nrotoxicosis, myxoedema, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, or hypopituitarism? See p202.\n  \n\u2022 Is there an abnormal distribution of body hair (eg bearded \ue033, or hairless \ue032) sug-\ngestive of endocrine disease?\n  \n\u2022 Is there anything about the patient to trigger thoughts about Paget\u2019s disease, Mar-\nfan\u2019s, myotonia, or Parkinson\u2019s syndrome? Look for rashes, eg the malar \ufb02 ush of \nmitral disease and the butter\ufb02 y rash of SLE.\nPeripheral stigmata of disease\nSpeci\ufb01 c signs are associated with diff erent diseases: consider the nails (koilonychia \n= iron de\ufb01 ciency), subcutaneous nodules (rheumatoid, neuro\ufb01 broma?), and look for \nlymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal). See speci\ufb01 c systems for features to assess \nfor, but for all systems consider:\nSkin colour:\n  \n\u2022 Blue/purple = cyanosis (can also be central only, p34).\n  \n\u2022 Yellow = jaundice (yellow skin can also be caused by uraemia, pernicious anaemia, \ncarotenaemia\u2014check the sclera: if they are also yellow it is jaundice).\n  \n\u2022 Pallor: this is non-speci\ufb01 c; anaemia is assessed from the palmar skin creases (when \nspread) and conjunctivae (\ufb01 g 8.3)\u2014usually pale if Hb <80\u201390g/L: you cannot con-\nclude anything from normal conjunctival colour, but if they are pale, the patient is \nprobably anaemic.\n  \n\u2022 Hyperpigmentation: Addison\u2019s, haemo chromatosis (slate-grey) and amiodarone, \ngold, silver, and minocycline therapy.\nCharts:\n  \n\u2022 Temperature: varies during the day; a morning oral temperature >37.2\u00b0C or evening \n>37.7\u00b0C constitutes a fever.3 Rectal temperatures are generally 0.6\u00b0C above oral \ntemperatures. Remember that temperatures are generally lower in elderly patients \nand therefore fevers may not be as pronounced.4 A core temperature <35\u00b0C indi-\ncates hypothermia; special low-reading thermometers may be required.\n  \n\u2022 Blood pressure and pulse\u2014trends are more important than one-off  values; repeat \nif concerned.\n  \n\u2022 Urine: check urinalysis and input/output charts if available.\nFluid status When admitting an unwell patient, don\u2019t forget to assess their hydra-\ntion, check skin turgor and mucous membranes, look for sunken eyes, and check \ncapillary re\ufb01 ll (if well perfused <2s) and JVP.", "text_length": 3472, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 44/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 43, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.932446", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.934643", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
