Our job is often to give en-\ncouragement\u2014the more this is personalized for our individual patient the better.\nOne method is to encourage our patients to write about their experiences. In \none study this gave clear-cut bene\ufb01 ts in lymphoma patients. Participants report \npositive responses to writing, and half said that writing changed their thoughts \nabout their illness in a positive way (this increased on subsequent follow-up). \nTextual analysis identi\ufb01 es themes related to experiences of positive change, \ntransformation, and self-affi  rmation through re\ufb02 ection. These techniques are \nakin to those used in post-traumatic stress\u2014and remind us that some of our \ntreatments are as destabilizing to our patients as any shipwreck or earthquake. \n\u2018I can whine, I can complain, I can moan, and bitch, about all of the above, but I \nwon\u2019t\u2026. The true feat isn\u2019t escaping death, rather, learning how to live.\u2019\nSometimes narrating lymphoma experiences reveals bitterness, loss of control, \nand a feeling that life has been rendered void. Here our role is to receive these \nnegatives and to try to keep the channels of communication open, as dialogue \nis the only validated means of \ufb01 lling these voids. The need to enhance support \nnetworks and bolster social ties may trump all our pharmacological imperatives.\nQuality of life, lymphoma, and the role of expressive writing\nFig 8.61 Cervical lymphadenopathy in Hodg-\nkin\u2019s disease.\nFig 8.60 Mononuclear Reed\u2013Sternberg cell \nin a lymph node.\n\u00a9Prof. Tang\u00fcn and Dr K\u00f6rog\u02c7lu.\nFig 8.58 A Reed\u2013Sternberg cell with two \nnuclei, characteristic of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\nCourtesy of Prof. Christine Lawrence.\nFig 8.59 Another Reed\u2013Sternberg cell.\nCourtesy of the Crookston collection.", "text_length": 2210, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 369/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 368, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.801984", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.803584", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
