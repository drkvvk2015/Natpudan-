Good management of the condition by an integrated specialized team \nis therefore of utmost importance.\nAnti-epileptic drugs (AEDS) Should only be commenced by a specialist, after con-\n\ufb01 rmed epilepsy diagnosis, \u22652 seizures (unless risk of recurrence is high, eg struc-\ntural brain lesion, focal CNS de\ufb01 cit, or unequivocal epileptiform EEG), and following \na detailed discussion of treatment options with the patient. AED choice depends on \nseizure type and epilepsy syndrome, comorbidities, lifestyle, and patient preference:\n  \n\u2022 Focal (partial) seizures: 1st line: carbamazepine or lamotrigine. 2nd line: leveti-\nracetam, oxcarbazepine, or sodium valproate.\n13\n  \n\u2022 Generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate\n13 or lamotrigine. 2nd \nline: carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, or topiramate.\n  \u2022 Absence seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate\n13 or ethosuximide. 2nd line: lamotrigine.\n  \n\u2022 Myoclonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate.\n13 2nd line: levetiracetam, or topira-\nmate (but \ue000SE). Avoid carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine\u2014may worsen seizures.\n  \n\u2022 Tonic or atonic seizures: Sodium valproate\n13 or lamotrigine.\nTreat with one drug and with one doctor in charge only. Slowly build up doses over \n2\u20133 months (see BOX \u2018Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDS)\u2019) until seizures are controlled or \nmaximum dosage is reached. If ineff ective or not tolerated, switch to the next most \nappropriate drug. To switch drugs, introduce the new drug slowly, and only with-\ndraw the 1st drug once established on the 2nd. Dual (adjunct) therapy is necessary \nin <10% of patients\u2014consider if all appropriate drugs have been tried singly at the \noptimum dose.\nStopping AEDS: May be done under specialist supervision if the patient has been \nseizure-free for >2yrs and after assessing risks and bene\ufb01 ts for the individual (eg \nthe need to drive). The dose must be decreased slowly: over at least 2\u20133 months, or \n>6 months for benzodiazepines and barbiturates.\nOther interventions Psychological therapies: Eg relaxation, CBT. May bene\ufb01 t \nsome, but do not improve seizure frequency so only use as an adjunct to medica-\ntion. Surgical intervention: Can be considered if a single epileptogenic focus can \nbe identi\ufb01 ed (such as hippocampal sclerosis or a small low-grade tumour). Neuro-\nsurgical resection off ers up to 70% chance of seizure resolution, but carries the risk \nof causing focal neurological de\ufb01 cits. Alternatives: vagal nerve stimulation, deep \nbrain stimulation (DBS).\nSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) More common in uncontrolled \nepilepsy, and may be related to nocturnal seizure-associated apnoea or asystole.\nThose with epilepsy have 3x \ue000mortality. >700 epilepsy-related deaths are recorded/\nyr in the UK; up to 17% are SUDEPs. The charity SUDEP Action may be of some help \nto families.\n13 Sodium valproate is associated with signi\ufb01 cantly \ue000risk of birth and developmental defects in children \nborn to exposed mothers.
