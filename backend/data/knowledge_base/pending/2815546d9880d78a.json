Dull\nchest percussion makes theprobability of a pleural effusion much more likely but still requires a CXR to confirm the\ndiagnosis. When the pretest probability of pleural effusion is low, the absence of reduced tactile fremitus makes\npleural effusion less likely so that a CXR might not be necessary depending on the overall clinical situation\u2019\nJAMA 2009 301:3\nINVESTIGATIONS\nBASIC\n\u0002\nLABS\nCBCD, lytes, urea, Cr, LDH, total protein,\nAST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, INR, PTT, albumin\n\u0002\nIMAGING\nCXR (PA, lateral, decubitus), CT chest\n\u0002\nTHORACENTESIS\nsend pleural fluid for cell count\nand differential, Gram stain, C&S, AFB and fungal\ncultures, LDH, total protein, pH, and cytology.\nUnder special circumstances, also consider amy\nlase, glucose, cholesterol, adenosine deaminase\n(for TB), albumin\nSPECIAL\n\u0002\nBIOPSY\nclosed pleural biopsy, medical thoraco\nscopy, bronchoscopy, surgical biopsy (video\nassisted thoracic surgery)\nDIAGNOSTIC ISSUES\nOVERALL APPROACH\ngenerally, if the effusion is\n>1/4 of hemithorax, enough fluid is present for\ndiagnostic thoracentesis; obtain decubitus film to\nassess for loculation. In the absence of loculation,\nand with >10 mm [0.4 in.] layering of fluid on\ndecubitus\nfilm,\nbedside\nthoracentesis\ncan\nbe\nattempted; otherwise, request U/S guided thora\ncentesis. If only a small amount of fluid is present\n(<10 mm [<0.4 in.]) and/or HF suspected, start with\ndiuresis for 2 3 days. If no improvement, perform\nthoracentesis to distinguish between transudative\nand exudative causes\nLIGHT\u2019S CRITERIA FOR EXUDATIVE EFFUSION\nany one of the following criteria would suggest exu\ndative effusion: fluid/serum total protein ratio >0.5,\nfluid/serum LDH ratio >0.6, fluid LDH >2/3 upper\nlimit of normal serum level\nTHORACENTESIS PROCEDURE\nsee NEJM 2006\n355:e16\nPLEURAL FLUID ANALYSIS\n\u0002\nFLUID ACIDOSIS (pH <7.2)\ncomplicated parapneu\nmonic, TB, paragonimiasis, malignancy, rheuma\ntoid arthritis, SLE, hemothorax, esophageal rupture\n\u0002\nFLUID GLUCOSE (<3.3 mmol/L [<60 mg/dL])\npara\npneumonic, TB, paragonimiasis, malignancy, rheu\nmatoid arthritis, Churg Strauss, hemothorax\nDIAGNOSTIC ISSUES (CONT\u2019D)\n\u0002\nFLUID\nEOSINOPHILIA\n(>10%)\nparagonimiasis,\nmalignancy, Churg Strauss, asbestos, drug reac\ntion, pulmonary embolism, hemothorax, pneu\nmothorax, idiopathic (20%)\n\u0002\nCYTOLOGY FOR MALIGNANCY\nthe yield for diagnosis\nwith single attempt is 60%, two attempts is 85%,\nthree attempts is 90 95%; obtain as much fluid as\npossible to increase diagnostic yield\n\u0002\nFLUID FOR AFB\nobtain as much fluid as possible\nand ask laboratory to centrifuge collection and to\nculture sediment to increase diagnostic yield\nMANAGEMENT\nSYMPTOM CONTROL\nO2, diuresis (furosemide),\ndrainage (thoracentesis, pigtail catheter, PleurX\ncatheter, chest tube), pleurodesis (talc slurry or\npoudrage), surgery (talc slurry, pleuroperitoneal\nshunt, pleural abrasion, pleurectomy)\nTREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE\nSPECIFIC ENTITIES\nPARAPNEUMONIC EFFUSION\n\u0002\nUNCOMPLICATED\nexudative effusion that resolves\nwith resolution of pneumonia.

For unloculated fluid, chest tube/small\nbore catheter drainage usually adequate. For locu\nlated effusions, thrombolytics such as streptoki\nnase or TPA could be considered.
