The \n\u2018pallor\u2019 refers to the vasculature on the inner surface of the lid which is lacking \nHb. It is this colour \n but it should be: \nIn health or in unifactorial anaemia, all the red cells in a sample are about the same \nsize, and the graph of their volume distribution forms a narrow peak. In mixed \nanaemias, however, this peak broadens, re\ufb02 ecting an abnormally large RDW\u2014this \nmay be the \ufb01 rst clue to dual pathology. In coeliac disease, for example, poor ab-\nsorption of iron (\ue001MCV) and folate (\ue000MCV) may occur simultaneously, resulting in a \ncombination of microcytes and macrocytes in the circulation. The visual analogue \nof this is anisocytosis (p328) on a blood \ufb01 lm. The laboratory measure is a \ue000RDW, \nwhere RDW = the standard deviation of MCV divided by the mean MCV, multiplied \nby 100. Reference interval: 11 . 5\u201314 . 6%. If the MCV is high and the RDW is normal, the \ncause is likely to be alcohol, liver disease, or a marrow problem (chemotherapy or \naplastic anaemia).\nRed cell distribution width (RCDW or RDW)", "text_length": 1277, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 333/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 332, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.739447", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.740606", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 1}
