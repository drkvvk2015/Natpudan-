Pyrexia of un-\nknown origin (PUO)24 has a diff erential of >200 diseases. 15\u201330% of these patients will \neventually be given an infective diagnosis (depending on your corner of the globe). \n~20% will remain undiagnosed, but in most of these the fever will resolve within 4wks.\nDiagnostic criteria\nPyrexia >3wks with no identi\ufb01 ed cause after evaluation in hospital for 3d or \u22653 \nout-patient visits.\nFever may also be undiagnosed in speci\ufb01 c subgroups despite appropriate evaluation \nfor 3d, including negative cultures at \u2265 2 days:\n  \n\u2022 Nosocomial PUO: Patient hospitalized for >48h with no infection at admission.\n  \n\u2022 Immunode\ufb01 cient PUO: Pyrexia in patient with <500 neutrophils/microlitre.\n  \n\u2022 HIV PUO: Pyrexia in HIV infection lasting 3d as an in-patient or >4wks as an outpatient.\nHistory\nMost PUO are due to common diseases with atypical presentation. Consider all de-\ntails as potentially relevant. Include: travel (p414), diet, animal contact, changes in \nmedication, recreational drug use, obstetric/sexual history, family history (table 9.30).\nExamination\nCon\ufb01 rm fever. Pattern of fever is rarely helpful (contrary to the textbooks, most ma-\nlaria has no speci\ufb01 c pattern). Do not forget: mouth, genitals, skin, thyroid, lymphatic \nsystem, eyes including retina, temporal arteries (table 9.30).\nInvestigation\n\ue007Extent of investigation depends on immune status and how well the patient is.\n  \n\u2022 Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, electrophoresis, LDH, CK, ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid fac-\ntor, HIV test, malaria smear, interferon-gamma release assay for TB (p394).\n  \n\u2022 Microscopy and culture: Blood \u22483, urine, sputum (including AFB), stool, CSF.\n  \n\u2022 Imaging: CXR, abdominal/pelvic USS, venous Doppler. Consider: CT(PA), MRI, echo (TOE). \nFluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) highlights areas of \ue000glucose uptake including tu-\nmour and in\ufb02 ammation. It may aid/direct diagnosis in up to 50% of PUO.\n  \n\u2022 Other: Hepatitis serology, CMV, EBV, autoimmune screen, cryoglobulins, toxoplasmo-\nsis, brucellosis, Coxiella, lymph node biopsy, endoscopy, temporal artery biopsy.\nTable 9.30 PUO diff erential according to history and examination \ufb01 ndings \nHistory\nDiff erential\nAnimal contact\nBrucellosis, toxoplasmosis, Bartonella, leptospirosis, Q fever, \npsittacosis\nCough\nTB, PE, Q fever, enteric fever, sarcoidosis, legionnaire\u2019s disease\nNasal symptoms\nSinusitis, GPA, relapsing fever, psittacosis\nConfusion\nTB, Cryptococcus, sarcoid, carcinomatosis, brucellosis, enteric fever\nArthralgia\nSLE, infective endocarditis, Lyme disease, brucellosis, TB, IBD\nWeight loss\nMalignancy, vasculitis, TB, HIV, IBD, thyrotoxicosis\nFamily history\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\nDrug history\nDrug-induced fever (~7\u201310d after new drug)\nExamination\nDiff erential\nConjunctivitis\nLeptospirosis, relapsing fever, spotted fever, trichinosis\nUveitis\nTB, sarcoid, adult Still\u2019s disease, SLE, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\nMouth\nDental abscess, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, CMV, IBD\nLymphadenopathy\nLymphoma, TB, EBV, CMV, HIV, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, Bartonella\nRash\nHIV, EBV, SLE, vasculitis, Still\u2019s disease, endocarditis\nHepatomegaly\nTB, EBV, malignancy, malaria, enteric fever, granulomatous hepatitis, \nQ fever, visceral leishmaniasis\nSplenomegaly\nLeukaemia, lymphoma, TB, brucellosis, infective endocarditis, CMV, \nEBV, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoid, enteric fever, relapsing fever\nRenal\nChronic pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, renal tumour\nEpididymo-orchitis\nTB, lymphoma, EBV, brucellosis, leptospirosis", "text_length": 3742, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 450/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 449, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.944905", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.945616", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
