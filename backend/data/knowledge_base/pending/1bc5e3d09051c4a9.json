If the answer is \u2018no\u2019 then end-of-life choices, decisions, and care should be \naddressed.\nConsider: decline in functional performance, eg in bed or chair >50% of day, in-\ncreasing dependence, weight of co-morbidity, unstable or deteriorating symptom \nburden, decreased treatment response, weight loss >10% in 6 months, crisis admis-\nsions, serum albumin <25g/L, sentinel event, eg fall, transfer to nursing home.\nDeath is nature\u2019s cruel master stroke, allowing genotypes space to try new pheno-\ntypes. The time comes in the life of every organism when it is better to start from \nscratch, rather than carry on with the weight and muddle of endless accretions. \nOur bodies and minds are the perishable phenotypes on the wave of our genes. But \nour genes are not really our genes. It is we who belong to them for a few decades. \nAnd death is nature\u2019s great insult, that she should prefer to put all her eggs in the \nbasket of a defenceless, incompetent neonate; rather than in the tried and tested \ncustody of our own superb minds. But as our neuro\ufb01 brils begin to tangle, and that \nneonate walks to a wisdom that eludes us, we are forced to give nature credit for \nher daring idea. Of course, nature, in her careless way, can get it wrong: people \noften die in the wrong order and one of our chief roles is to prevent this misorder-\ning of deaths, not the phenomenon of death itself. With that exception, we must \nadmit that dying is a brilliant idea, and one that it is most unlikely we would ever \nhave devised ourselves.\nThe wisdom of death\nDeath13 is the irreversible loss of the essential characteristics which are necessary \nfor the existence of a human being.\nDeath following cessation of cardiorespiratory function:\n\ue007Simultaneous and irreversible onset of apnoea, absence of circulation, and un-\nconsciousness.\nCardiorespiratory arrest is con\ufb01 rmed by observation of the following:\n  \n\u2022 Absence of central pulse on palpation.\n  \n\u2022 Absence of heart sounds on auscultation.\n  \n\u2022 After 5 minutes of cardiorespiratory arrest absence of brainstem activity is con-\n\ufb01 rmed by the absence of pupillary responses to light, an absent corneal re\ufb02 ex, \nand no motor response to supra-orbital pressure.\nThe time of death is the time at which these criteria are ful\ufb01 lled.\nBrainstem death:\n\ue007Brainstem pathology causing irreversible damage to its integrative functions \nincluding neural control of cardiorespiratory function and consciousness.\nDiagnosed by an absence of brainstem re\ufb02 exes:\n  \n\u2022 No pupil light response.\n  \n\u2022 No corneal re\ufb02 ex (blink to touch).\n  \n\u2022 Absent oculovestibular re\ufb02 exes (no eye movements seen with injection of ice-\ncold water into each external auditory meatus, tympanic membranes visualized).\n  \n\u2022 No motor response to stimulation within the cranial nerve distribution (supra-\norbital pressure).\n  \n\u2022 No cough/gag re\ufb02 ex.\n  \n\u2022 No respiratory response to hypercarbia: oxgenation is maintained (SpO2>85%) \nbut ventilation is reduced to achieve PaCO2 \u22656.0kPa with pH \u22647.40. No respiratory \nresponse is seen within 5 minutes and PaCO2 rises by >0.5kPa.\nDiagnosis is made by two competent doctors registered for >5 years testing to-\ngether completely and successfully on two separate occasions. \nDiagnosing death", "text_length": 3440, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 24/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 23, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.896068", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.896814", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
