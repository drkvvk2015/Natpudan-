Secretion by four para-\nthyroid glands is triggered by \ue001serum ionized Ca\n2+; controlled by \u03a9ve feedback loop. \nActions are: \u2022\ue000osteoclast activity releasing Ca\n2+ and PO4\n3\u03a9 from bones \u2022\ue000Ca\n2+ & \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9 \nreabsorption in the kidney \u2022\ue000renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3.\nVitamin D and calcitriol: Vit D is hydroxylated \ufb01 rst in the liver to 25-hydroxy-vit D, \nand again in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxy-vit D (calcitriol), the biologically active form, \nand 24,25-hydroxy-vit D (inactive). Calcitriol production is stimulated by \ue001Ca\n2+, \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9, \nand \ue000PTH. Actions are: \u2022\ue000Ca\n2+ and \ue000PO4\n3\u03a9 absorption from the gut \u2022inhibition of PTH \nrelease \u2022enhanced bone turnover \u2022\ue000Ca\n2+ and \ue000PO4\n3\u03a9 reabsorption in the kidney. Chole-\ncalciferol (vit D3\u2014from animal sources) and ergocalciferol (vit D2\u2014from vegetables) \nare biologically identical in their activity. Disordered regulation of calcitriol underlies \nfamilial normocalc aemic hypercalciuria, which is a major cause of calcium oxalate \nrenal stone formation (p638).\nCalcitonin: Made in C-cells of the thyroid, this causes \ue001Ca\n2+ and \ue001PO4\n3\u03a9, but its physi-\nological role is unclear. It can be used as a marker of recurrence or metastasis in \nmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid.\nMagnesium: \ue001Mg\n2+ prevents PTH release, and may cause hypocalcaemia.\nPlasma binding: Labs usually measure total plasma Ca\n2+. ~40% is bound to albumin, \nand the rest is free ionized Ca\n2+ which is the physiologically important amount (often \navailable on blood gas analyser). Therefore, correct total Ca\n2+ for albumin as follows: \nadd 0.1mmol/L to Ca\n2+ level for every 4g/L that albumin is below 40g/L, and a similar \nsubtraction for raised albumin. However, many other factors aff ect binding (eg other \nproteins in myeloma, cirrhosis, individual variation) so be cautious in your interpreta-\ntion. If in doubt over a high Ca\n2+, take blood specimens uncuff ed (remove tourniquet \nafter needle in vein, but before taking blood sample), and with the patient fasted.\nHypercalcaemia\nSigns and symptoms \u2018Bones, stones, groans, and psychic moans.\u2019 Abdominal pain; \nvomiting; constipation; polyuria; polydipsia; depression; anorexia; weight loss; tired-\nness; weakness; hypertension, confusion; pyrexia; renal stones; renal failure; ectopic \ncalci\ufb01 cation (eg cornea\u2014see BOX); cardiac arrest. ECG: \ue001QT interval.\nCauses (See \ufb01 g 14.5.) Most commonly malignancy (eg from bone metastases, mye-\nloma, PTHrP) or primary hyperparathyroidism. Others include sarcoidosis, vit D intoxi-\ncation, thyrotoxicosis, lithium, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome, \nand familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (rare; defect in calcium-sensing \nreceptor). HIV can cause both \ue000 & \ue001Ca\n2+ (perhaps from PTH-related bone remodelling).6\nInvestigations The main distinction is malignancy vs 1\u00b0 hyperparathyroidism. \nPointers to malignancy are \ue001albumin, \ue001Cl\n\u03a9, alkal osis, \ue001K\n+, \ue000PO4\n3\u03a9, \ue000ALP. \ue000PTH indicates \nhyperparathyroidism. Also FBC, protein electrophoresis, CXR, isotope bone scan, 24h \nurinary Ca\n2+ excretion (for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia). \nParathormone (PTH)\ue000 (p222) and other causes of \ue000Ca\n2+, eg sarcoidosis; Amyloidosis; \nRenal failure (relates to \ue000PO4\n3\u03a9); Addison\u2019s disease (adrenal calci\ufb01 cation); \nTB nodes; Toxoplasmosis (CNS); Histoplasmosis (eg in lung); Overdose of vitamin D; \nRaynaud\u2019s-associated diseases (eg SLE; systemic sclerosis p552; dermatomyositis); \nMuscle primaries/leiomyosarcomas); Ossifying metastases (Osteosarcoma) or Ovar-\nian mets (to peritoneum); Nephrocalcinosis; Endocrine tumours (eg gastrinoma).\nCauses of metastatic (ectopic) calci\ufb01 cation \u2018PARATTHORMONE\u2019", "text_length": 3886, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 684/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 683, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.345628", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.346380", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
