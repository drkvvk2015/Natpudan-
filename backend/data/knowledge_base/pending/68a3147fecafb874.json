See p711 \nfor causes of long QT intervals.\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n99\nCardiovascular medicine\nFig 3.5 Rhythm strips of heart blocks.\nWhen considering rate and rhythm, your \ufb01 ndings should be the same in all leads, \nalbeit clearer in some than others. Other ECG features may vary lead by lead, both \nin terms of what is \u2018normal\u2019 and in what a change indicates. For example, ST eleva-\ntion in leads II, III, and aVF suggests an inferior MI requiring immediate treatment, \nlikely PCI to the right coronary artery, see table 3.2. ST elevation across all leads, \nhowever, suggests instead pericarditis which necessitates entirely diff erent man-\nagement (p154). An R wave taller than the S is deep (R dominance) is normal in V5 \nand V6 but may suggest right ventricular strain or posterior MI if seen in V1 and V2.\nTable 3.2 ECG territories\nECG leads\nHeart territory\nCoronary artery\nI, aVL, V4\u2013V6\nLateral\nCircum\ufb02 ex\nV1\u20133\nAnterioseptal\nLeft anterior descending\nII, III, aVF\nInferior\nRight coronary artery in 80%\nCircum\ufb02 ex in 20%: \u2018left dominant\u2019\nV7\u20139\nPosterior\nCircum\ufb02 ex\nFollowing a posterior MI, the standard 12-lead ECG will not show Q waves, ST \nelevation or hyperacute T waves. Instead, you may \ufb01 nd these changes but \n\u2018upside-down\u2019 in V1\u2013V3: prominent R waves, \ufb02 at ST depression, and T-wave inver-\nsion. If you record V7\u2013V9 leads, you may \ufb01 nd the classic ST elevation pattern and \nso con\ufb01 rm posterior MI. See \ufb01 g 3.24.\nThe \u2018upside-down\u2019 changes seen in posterior MI are called \u2018reciprocal changes\u2019: \nchanges that appear when \u2018looking\u2019 at ischaemic myocardium from the other side \nof the heart. These can arise with MIs in other locations (\ufb01 g 3.9). They are particu-\nlarly important in posterior MI as they may be the only changes on the 12-lead ECG.\n\ue007See \ufb01 g 3.9, 3.10, 3.24 for example ECGs.
