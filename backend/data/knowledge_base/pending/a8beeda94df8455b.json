Nonetheless, for many of our increasingly overweight population, simply \neating less (eg 2500 calories/d for men and 2000 for women) and balancing in-\ntake across food groups seems a sensible start. Diet is of course not independent \nof lifestyle, and we should continue to promote a balanced diet in the context of \nthe full range of public health messages. Unravelling these confounding threads in \npopulation-level data will always pose a challenge\u2014while some studies show veg-\netarians may be less likely to die from ischaemic heart disease, is this eff ect because \nvegetarians in the UK are more likely to be non-smokers? Overly proscriptive applica-\ntion of such population-level data in advice given to individuals (as journalists may \nbe prone to do) will always be \ufb02 awed and risks drowning important fundamental \nconcepts in a sea of cynicism.\nCurrent recommendations must take into account three facts\n  \n\u2022 Obesity costs health services as much as smoking\u20141 in 4 UK adults is obese. \n  \n\u2022 Diabetes mellitus is burgeoning: in some places prevalence is >7% (p206).\n  \n\u2022 Past advice has not changed eating habits in large sections of the population.\nAdvice is likely to focus on the following\nBody mass index: (BMI; table 6.1.) Aim for 18.5\u201325. Controlling quantity may be more \nimportant than quality. In hypertension, eating the \u2018right\u2019 things lowers BP only mar-\nginally, but controlling weight causes a more signi\ufb01 cant reduction.\nBase meals on starch: (Bread, rice, potatoes, pasta.) These provide a slower re-\nlease form of carbohydrate compared to diets containing re\ufb01 ned sugar, and be-\nware of the high sugar contents of, eg soft drinks.\nEat enough fruit and vegetables: Aiming for 5 portions a day.\nEat foods high in fat, salt, or sugar infrequently.\nEat some meat, \ufb01 sh, eggs, and beans: Aim for 2 portions of \ufb01 sh a week, includ-\ning oily \ufb01 sh (those rich in omega-3 fatty acid, such as mackerel, herring, pilchards, \nsalmon). Non-dairy sources of protein include beans and nuts. Aim to reduce intake \nof red or processed meat to <70g/day.\nEat some milk and dairy products: Select those options with lower fat, sugar and \nsalt where possible.\nModerate alcohol use (adults <65yrs): \ue00514U/wk for both men and women, spread \nover 3 or more days. There is no \u2018safe\u2019 level.\nSupplements: There is scant evidence for most nutritional supplements in those \nable to follow a balanced diet. Women attempting to conceive should take 400mcg/\nday folic acid from (pre-)conception until at least 12wks. Vitamin D supplements \n(10mcg/day) may bene\ufb01 t breast-feeding mothers, those \u226565yrs old, those whose \nskin is not typically exposed to sun, or those with very dark skin. Lower doses may be \nrecommended for infants and young children.\n\ue007This diet is not appropriate for all: \u2022 <5yrs old. \u2022 Need for low residue (eg \nCrohn\u2019s, UC, p264) or special diet (coeliac disease, p266). Emphasis may be differ-\nent in: Dyslipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); obesity; constipation (p260); liver failure \n(p274); chronic pancreatitis (p270); renal failure (less protein)(p304); \ue000BP (see p140). \nDiffi  culties It is an imposition to ask us to change our diet (children often refuse \npoint-blank); a more subtle approach is to take a food we enjoy (crisps) and make it \nhealthier (eg low-salt crisps made from jacket potatoes and fried in sun\ufb02 ower oil).", "text_length": 3774, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 252/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 251, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.445284", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.446001", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
