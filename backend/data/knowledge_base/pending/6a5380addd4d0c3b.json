In\ufb02 ammatory cell in\ufb01 ltrate and \npulmonary \ufb01 brosis of unknown cause. It is the commonest cause of interstitial lung \ndisease.\nSymptoms Dry cough; exertional dyspnoea; malaise; \ue001weight; arthralgia.\nSigns Cyanosis; \ufb01 nger clubbing; \ufb01 ne end-inspiratory crepitations.\nComplications Respiratory failure; \ue000risk of lung cancer.\nTests Blood: ABG (\ue001PaO2; if severe, \ue000PaCO2); \ue000CRP; \ue000immunoglobulins; ANA (30% +ve), \nrheumatoid factor (10% +ve). Imaging: (\ufb01 g 4.20) \ue001Lung volume; bilateral lower zone \nreticulo-nodular shadows; honeycomb lung (advanced disease). CT: Shows similar \nchanges to the CXR but is more sensitive and is an essential for diagnosis. Spirom-\netry: Restrictive (p162); \ue001transfer factor. BAL: May indicate activity of alveolitis: \n\ue000lymphocytes (good response/prognosis) or \ue000neutrophils and \ue000eosinophils (poor \nresponse/prognosis). 99TCm-DTPA scan: (diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid) May \nre\ufb02 ect disease activity.59 Lung biopsy: May be needed for diagnosis. The histological \nchanges observed on biopsy are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).\nManagement Supportive care: oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, opiates, palliative \ncare input. All patients should be considered for current clinical trials or lung trans-\nplantation. 60 It is strongly recommended that high-dose steroids are not used except \nwhere the diagnosis of IPF is in doubt. \nPrognosis 50% 5yr survival rate (range 1\u201320yrs).\nFig 4.20 Interstitial lung disease due to idiopathic pulmonary \ufb01 brosis (a similar appearance to the \ninterstitial oedema of moderate left heart failure, but without a big heart).\nCourtesy of Prof P Scally.\nNintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to slow disease progression and off er \nsome hope to suff erers of IPF. Pirfenidone, an immunosuppressant and anti\ufb01 brotic \nagent, showed a reduction in the rate of lung scarring and has been shown to improve \nlife expectancy compared to best supportive care.61 Nintedanib targets three growth \nfactor receptors involved in pulmonary \ufb01 brosis.\nA new treatment emerges for suff erers of IPF", "text_length": 2242, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 208/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 207, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.310986", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.311811", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
