Con\ufb01 rmed by \ue001ferritin (also \ue001serum \niron with \ue000TIBC, but these are less reliable, see table 8.1). \ue007NB: ferritin is an acute \nphase protein and \ue000 with in\ufb02 ammation, eg infection, malignancy. Transferrin \nis also \ue000 in IDA but is less aff ected by in\ufb02 ammation. Check coeliac serology in all \n(p266): if negative then refer all males and females who are not menstruating for \nurgent gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Consider stool microscopy for ova if relevant \ntravel history. Faecal occult blood is not recommended as sensitivity is poor. \ue007IDA \nwith no obvious source of bleeding mandates careful GI workup.\n2\nTreatment Treat the cause. Oral iron, eg ferrous sulfate 200mg/8h PO. SE: nausea, ab-\ndominal discomfort, diarrhoea or constipation, black stools. Hb should rise by 10g/L/\nweek, with a modest reticulocytosis (young RBC, p328). Continue for at least 3 months \nafter Hb normalizes to replenish stores. IV iron is only indicated if the oral route is \nimpossible or ineff ective, eg functional iron de\ufb01 ciency in chronic renal failure, where \nthere is inadequate mobilization of iron stores in response to erythropoietin therapy.\nThe usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient \nhas rejected the pills\u2014check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI distur-\nbance? Altering the dose of elemental iron with a diff erent preparation may help. \nAlternatively, there may be continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chron-\nic disease; or misdiagnosis, eg when thalassaemia is to blame.\nAnaemia of chronic disease (secondary anaemia)\nThe commonest anaemia in hospital patients (and the 2nd commonest, after IDA, \nworldwide). It arises from three problems (in which the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays \na key role): 1  Poor use of iron in erythropoiesis. 2  Cyto kine-induced shortening of RBC \nsurvival. 3  \ue001Production of and response to erythropoietin.\nCauses Many, eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure.\nTests Ferritin normal or \ue000 in mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia (eg Hb >80g/L; \nsee table 8.1). Check blood \ufb01 lm, B12, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis (p336).\nTreatment Treating the underlying disease may help (eg in 60% of patients with \nRA), as may erythropoietin (SE: \ufb02 u-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the \nplatelet count and thromboembolism). Also eff ective in improving quality of life \nin malignant disease. IV iron can safely overcome the functional iron de\ufb01 ciency. \nHepcidin inhibitors and in\ufb02 ammatory modulators show promise.\nSideroblastic anaemia\nMicrocytic anaemia does not always mean iron de\ufb01 ciency! 20% of older people with \nan MCV <75fL are not iron de\ufb01 cient. \ue007Think of sideroblastic anaemia whenever \nmicrocytic anaemia is not responding to iron. This condition is characterized by \nineff ective erythropoiesis, leading to \ue000iron absorption, iron loading in marrow \u00b1 hae-\nmosiderosis (endocrine, liver, and heart damage due to iron deposition).\nCauses Congenital (rare, x-linked) or acqui red, eg idiopathic as one of the myelo-\ndysplastic/myeloprolif erative diseases, can also follow chemotherapy, anti-TB drugs, \nirradiation, alcohol or lead excess. Tests Look for \ue000ferritin, a hypo chromic blood \ufb01 lm, \nand disease-de\ufb01 ning sideroblasts in the marrow (\ufb01 gs 8.8, 8.9; table 8.1). Treatment \nRemove the cause. Pyridoxine \u00b1 repeated transfusions for severe anaemia.\n2 In one study, 11% presenting to their GP with IDA had GI carcinoma.
