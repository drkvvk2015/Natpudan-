Incidence data limited by failures in recognition and diagnosis. \nDivided into super\ufb01 cial/cutaneous and systemic/invasive.\nSuper\ufb01 cial/cutaneous mycoses\n  \n\u2022 Dermatophytosis: Dermatophyte fungi digest keratin. Cause infection of skin and \nkeratinized structures, eg hair, nails. Presentation: Scale and pruritus. Skin lesion \nmay be annular with central healing, eg ring worm, tinea corporis. Tinea pedis af-\nfects up to 15% of healthy population: skin erosions and blisters in toe web spaces, \ndry scale on soles. Fungal nail disease = onychomycosis/tinea unguium: discoloura-\ntion, nail thickening. Tinea capitis: scalp scaling, alopecia.\n  \n\u2022 Super\ufb01 cial candidiasis: Usually Candida albicans \n(\ufb01 g 9.17), a commensal in mouth, vagina, and GI tract. \nRisk factors: immunosuppression, antibiotic treat-\nment. Presentation: Oropharyngeal: white patches \non erythematous background (plaque type); sore, in-\n\ufb02 amed areas (erythematous type). GU: soreness, white \npatches/discharge (\ufb01 g 9.18). Skin: usually in folds/in-\nterdigital (\ufb01 g 9.19).\n  \n\u2022 Malassezia: Commensals of greasy skin. Presentation: Pityriasis versicolor: scaly \nhypo/hyperpigmented rash with scaling (\ufb01 g 9.20). Seborrhoeic dermatitis: scaling \nof face, scalp (dandruff ), anterior chest. Malassezia folliculitis: itchy, follicular rash \non back and shoulders (\ue031\ue031 acne).\nDiagnosis: Clinical, microscopy of skin scrapings. Treatment: All super\ufb01 cial mycos-\nes: topical \u2018-azole\u2019 antifungal or terbina\ufb01 ne 1\u20134wk. Also topical nystatin and ampho-\ntericin in super\ufb01 cial candidiasis. Tinea capitis: griseofulvin, terbina\ufb01 ne, itraconazole. \nNail infection requires systemic treatment (terbina\ufb01 ne, itraconazole)\ue018 con\ufb01 rm diag-\nnosis, and caution re side-eff ects including hepatotoxicity.\nSystemic/invasive mycoses\n  \n\u2022 Invasive candidiasis: Typically occurs in immunocomp romised, comorbidity, or \nITU settings. Genetic susceptibility likely contributes. Estimated 250 000/yr with \n50 000 deaths. Candidaemia in ~7/1000 ICU patients. Presentation: Risk factors for \ninvasive fungal disease (see p409), febrile with no microbiological evidence of infec-\ntion, new murmur, muscle tenderness, skin nodules. Diagnosis: (Repeated) blood/\ntissue culture. PCR. Candida in respiratory secretions alone is insuffi  cient. Treat-\nment: Remove all possible catheters. Echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, \nmicafungin), \ufb02 uconazole, amphotericin (liposomal for \ue001renal toxicity). Consider \n\ufb02 uconazole prophylaxis if risk factors for invasive disease (p403). Consider em-\npirical treatment if persistent fever, unresponsive to other therapy (discuss with \nmicrobiologist, choice depends on local epidemiology, comorbidity).\n  \n\u2022 Cryptococcus: See HIV p400. Causes meningitis, pneumonia. Presentation: Usu-\nally immunosuppression, eg HIV, sarcoid, Hodgkin\u2019s, haematological malignancy, \npost-transplant. History may be long, non-speci\ufb01 c. Headache, confusion, ataxia, \nfocal neurological signs, fever, cough, pleuritic pain, SOB. Diagnosis: Indian ink CSF \nstain, culture blood/CSF/BAL, antigen testing in blood/CSF. Treatment: Amphotericin \n+ \ufb02 ucytosine, \ufb02 uconazole.\n  \n\u2022 Histoplasmosis: Worldwide distribution of Histoplasma, \ue000 in soil contaminated \nwith bird/bat faeces. Illness depends on host immunity, estimated ~1%. Presenta-\ntion: Flu-like symptoms, fever, malaise, cough, headache, myalgia, pneumonia, lung \nnodules/cavitation, pericarditis, mediastinal \ufb01 brosis/granuloma (\ue031\ue031 sarcoid, TB). \nDiagnosis: Serology, antigen testing. Treatment: Moderate-severe lung disease or \nany CNS involvement: amphotericin, itraconazole.\n  \n\u2022 Blastomycosis: Blastomyces in decomposing matter, mainly USA/Canada. Pres-\nentation: Fever, cough, night sweats, ARDS. \ue000risk of extra-pulmonary disease with \nimmunosuppression: skin, bone, GU, CNS. Diagnosis: Culture, antigen detection \n(cross-reacts with histoplasmosis). Treatment: Amphotericin, itraconazole.\n\ue007See also: Fungi and the lung p177, Pneumocystis jirovecii p400. \nFig 9.17 Candida albicans.\nCourtesy of P-Y Guillaume.", "text_length": 4226, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 416/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 415, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.889491", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.890860", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
