Other potential mechanisms\ninclude recruitment of collapsed alveoli, increased\nfunctional residual capacity, and improvement in\nV/Q matching. Usually set at 5 cmH2O. >15 cmH2O\nmay cause barotrauma\n\u0004\nPEAK AIRWAY PRESSURE (Ppeak)\nmaximal inspira\ntory pressure to distend alveoli and to overcome\nairway resistance. Ppeak is dependent on inflation\nvolume, airways resistance, and lung/chest wall\ncompliance. Happens about halfway through\ninspiration phase\n\u0004\nPLATEAU\nPRESSURE (Pplat)\npressure to prevent\nlungs from deflating at end inspiration. Related\nto lung/chest wall compliance. Normal is 33\t9\ncmH2O\n\u0004\nRAPID\nSHALLOW\nBREATHING\nINDEX (RSBI)\nindex\nused for weaning. The lower the better (<70 is\nexcellent, <100 is good). RSBI = RR/tidal volume\n(measured in liters)\nASSESSMENT OF AIRWAY\nPRIOR TO INTUBATION\nassess airway to antici\npate difficulty of procedure, establish IV access (for\nblood pressure control and medication administra\ntion), position patient (sniffing position), remove\nfalse teeth/dentures, suction and endotracheal\ntube ready\nSUBJECTIVE SIGNS OF DIFFICULT AIRWAY\npro\nminent upper incisors, short/thick neck, large tongue,\nmicrognathia\nOBJECTIVE SIGNS OF DIFFICULT AIRWAY\n\u0004\nNECK EXTENSION\natlanto occipital extension \b358\n\u0004\nTHYROMENTAL DISTANCE\n<6 cm [<2.4 in.] (3 finger\nbreaths)\n\u0004\nMOUTH OPENING\n<4 cm [<1.6 in.] (2 3 finger\nbreaths)\n\u0004\nMANDIBULAR LENGTH\n<9 cm [3.5 in.]\n\u0004 MALLAMPATI SCORE\nIII/IV may indicate difficult air\nway for intubation\n\u0004 I = visualization of the soft palate, fauces, uvula,\nanterior and posterior pillars\n\u0004 II = visualization of the soft palate, fauces, and\nuvula\n\u0004 III = visualization of the soft palate and the base\nof the uvula\n\u0004 IV = soft palate is not visible at all\nARTIFICIAL AIRWAYS\nORAL AIRWAYS\nused in unconscious patients\nwithout a gag reflex to prevent airway collapse/\nARTIFICIAL AIRWAYS (CONT\u2019D)\nobstruction. Also allow access for suctioning and\nstimulation of cough. Sizes 8, 9, 10 cm in length\n(Guedel sizes 3, 4, 5). Insert backward along the\nhard palate and rotate into position. If improperly\nplaced, may push tongue posteriorly and obstruct\nthe airway. Can induce vomiting or laryngospasm if\nplaced in an awake or semiconscious patient\nENDOTRACHEAL TUBES (NEJM 2007 356:e15)\ninserted nasally or orally, with aid of laryngoscope or\nbronchoscope. Sizes 6.0 9.0 mm in diameter. Cuff\noccludes airway surrounding endotracheal tube\n(cuff pressure <25 mmHg ideally; inflate cuff only\nto the point when leak disappears, i.e. use minimal\nocclusion pressure)\nTRACHEOSTOMY TUBES\n\u0004\nINDICATIONS\nlong term ventilation (>10 14 days\nintubation), to facilitate weaning, or to bypass an\nupper airway obstruction\n\u0004\nTYPES\nPortex, Shiley (fenestrated)\n\u0004\nCOMPONENTS\nfenestrations\n(openings\nin\ntra\ncheostomy tube allowing weaker patients to\ntolerate plugging trials easier), disposable inner\ncannula (seal fenestration, allows easier exchange\nof tracheostomy tube if plugged), cuff (balloon\nthat occludes airway surrounding tracheostomy\ntube)\n\u0004\nPLUGGING PROCEDURE\nprovide alternate source of\nO2 (via upper airway), suction of upper and lower\nairways, deflate cuff completely, remove inner\ncannula if present, insert plug and lock it in\nplace, assess patient for airway patency, increased\nwork of breathing and stridor\n\u0004\nDECANNULATION\nCRITERIA\nbreathing\nsponta\nneously without ventilator assistance, consistent\ncough and ability to expectorate secretions,\nawake enough to protect airway, on minimal FiO2\n(<40% or <5 6 l/min), no evidence of upper air\nway obstruction\nTRACHEOSTOMY BUTTONS\nto maintain stoma\nduring weaning. Less resistance than plugged tra\ncheostomy tube. Usually left in for <24 h\nVENTILATORY SETTINGS\nRATE\nminimal respiratory rate. Normal = 8 16\nTIDAL VOLUME\nrange 5 8 mL/kg of ideal body\nweight. Normal = 400 600 mL. In volume cycled\nmodes only\nPEAK FLOW\ndetermines how fast a positive pres\nsure breath is delivered. In volume cycled modes\nonly\nPRESSURE\nSUPPORT\nranges\nfrom\n6\ncmH2O\n(almost no support) to 30 cmH2O (max). Normal =\n14 16 cmH2O.
