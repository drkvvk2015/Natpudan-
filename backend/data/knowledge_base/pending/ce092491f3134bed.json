Causes: MND, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9, polio, myasthenia gravis, \nsyringo bulbia (p516), brainstem tumours, central pontine myelinolysis (p672).\nCorticobulbar palsy UMN lesion of muscles of swallowing and talking due to \nbilateral lesions above the mid-pons, eg corticobulbar tracts (MS, MND, stroke, cen-\ntral pontine myelinolysis). It is commoner than bulbar palsy. Signs: Slow tongue \nmovements, with slow deliberate speech; \ue000jaw jerk; \ue000pharyngeal and palatal re-\n\ufb02 exes; pseudobulbar aff ect (PBA)\u2014weeping unprovoked by sorrow or mood-incon-\ngruent giggling (emotional incontinence without mood change is also seen in MS, \nWilson\u2019s, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia, nitrous oxide use, and head injury).

However, pa-\ntients with MND often have no cognitive impairment in the early stages of the dis-\nease, and witness their inorexable physical decline with terri\ufb01 ed awareness. For \nthis reason it is imperative to plan for the future early: discuss their wishes for \nend-of-life care and in the eventuality of respiratory decline before it is too late \nfor wishes to be communicated. These discussions are crucial but not binding: the \npatient can change their mind at any point, and also refuse any life-prolonging \ntreatment, knowing the consequence is death. However, in most countries, in-\ncluding the UK, we cannot traverse that line that lies between management of \na supported death following withdrawal of life-prolonging (or death-prolonging) \ninterventions, and acting with the intention of causing death. Court battles en-\nsue, with requests for assisted suicide that may frustrate and challenge ethicists, \nphysicians, politicians, and the judiciary, but above all, patients and their families. \nFaced with such con\ufb02 icting passions, perhaps our role is to be clear that we stand \nbeside our patients, come what may.\nDignity and Dignitas", "text_length": 2999, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 515/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 514, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.062284", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.063042", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
