The classic triad includes angina, syncope, and heart failure. Also: \ndyspnoea; dizziness; faints; systemic emboli if infective endocarditis; sudden death. \nSigns: Slow rising pulse with narrow pulse pressure (feel for diminished and delayed \ncarotid upstroke\u2014parvus et tardus); heaving, non-displaced apex beat; LV heave; \naortic thrill; ejection systolic murmur (heard at the base, left sternal edge and the \naortic area, radiates to the carotids). S1 is usually normal. As stenosis worsens, A2 is \nincreasingly delayed, giving \ufb01 rst a single S2 and then reversed splitting. But this sign \nis rare. More common is a quiet A2. In severe AS, A2 may be inaudible (calci\ufb01 ed valve). \nThere may be an ejection click (pliable valve) or an S4.\nTests: ECG: LVH with strain pattern; P-mitrale; LAD; poor R-wave progression; LBBB \nor complete AV block (calci\ufb01 ed ring). CXR: LVH; calci\ufb01 ed aortic valve (\ufb01 g 3.44); post-\nstenotic dilatation of ascending aorta. Echo: diagnostic (p110). Doppler echo can \nestimate the gradient across valves: severe stenosis if peak gradient \ue00640mmHg (but \nbeware the poor left ventricle not able to generate gradient) and valve area <1cm\n2. \nIf the aortic jet velocity is >4m/s (or is increasing by >0.3m/s per yr) risk of complica-\ntions is increased. 57 Cardiac catheter can assess: valve gradient; LV function; coronary \nartery disease; risks: emboli generation.\nDifferential diagnosis: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, p152); aortic sclerosis.\nManagement: If symptomatic, prognosis is poor without surgery: 2\u20133yr survival if \nangina/syncope; 1\u20132yr if cardiac failure. If moderate-to-severe and treated medi-\ncally, mortality can be as high as 50% at 2yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement \n(p148) is usually recommended. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and a dete-\nriorating ECG, valve replacement is also recommended. If the patient is not medically \n\ufb01 t for surgery, percutaneous valvuloplasty/replacement (TAVI = transcatheter aortic \nvalve implantation) may be attempted (\ufb01 g 3.45).\nAortic sclerosis Senile degeneration of the valve. There is an ejection systolic mur-\nmur; but no carotid radiation, and normal pulse (character and volume) and S2.\nAortic regurgitation (AR) Acute: Infective endocarditis, ascending aortic dis-\nsection, chest trauma. Chronic: Congenital, connective tissue disorders (Marfan\u2019s \nsyndrome, Ehlers\u2013Danlos), rheumatic fever, Takayasu arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, \nSLE, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, appetite suppressants (eg fen\ufb02 uramine, phenter-\nmine), seronegative arthritides (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter\u2019s syndrome, psor iatic \narthropathy), hyper tension, osteogenesis imperfecta, syphilitic aortitis.\nSymptoms: Exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and PND. Also: palpitations, angina, \nsyncope, CCF. Signs: Collapsing (water-hammer) pulse (p42); wide pulse pressure; \ndisplaced, hyperdynamic apex beat; high-pit ched early diastolic murmur (heard best \nin expiration, with patient sat forward). Eponyms: Corrigan\u2019s sign: carotid pulsation; \nde Musset\u2019s sign: head nodding with each heart beat; Quincke\u2019s sign: capillary pulsa-\ntions in nail beds; Duroziez\u2019s sign: in the groin, a \ufb01 nger compressing the femoral ar-\ntery 2cm proximal to the stethoscope gives a systolic murmur; if 2cm distal, it gives \na diastolic murmur as blood \ufb02 ows backwards; Traube\u2019s sign: \u2018pistol shot\u2019 sound over \nfemoral arteries; an Austin Flint murmur (p46) denotes severe AR.\nTests: ECG: LVH. CXR: cardiomegaly; dilated ascending aorta; pulmonary oedema. Echo \nis diagnostic. Cardiac catheterization to assess: severity of lesion; anatomy of aortic \nroot; LV function; coronary artery disease; other valve disease.\nManagement: The main goal of medical therapy is to reduce systolic hypertension; \nACE-i are helpful. Echo every 6\u201312 months to monitor. Indications for surgery: severe \nAR with enlarged ascending aorta, increasing symptoms, enlarging LV or deterio-\nrating LV function on echo; or infective endocarditis refractory to medical therapy. \nAim to replace the valve before signi\ufb01 cant LV dysfunction occurs. Predictors of poor \npost-operative survival: ejection fraction <50%, NYHA class III or IV (p135), duration \nof CCF >12 months.", "text_length": 4576, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 154/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 153, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.121608", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.122260", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
