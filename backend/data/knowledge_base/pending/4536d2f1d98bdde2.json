While no standard definition for\nfrailty exists, it is associated with (1) limited function,\n(2) multiple medical conditions, and (3) one of the\ngeriatric syndromes (dementia, delirium, depression,\nfalls \u00021 per month, osteoporosis, failure to thrive, and\nurinary incontinence). Frailty predisposes patients to\nfunctional and cognitive decline, particularly in the\npresence of precipitants/stressors. While age can be a\nfactor in choosing treatments due to altered pharma\ncokinetics, frailty is a more important treatment mod\nifying factor. In general, less aggressive (and some\ntimes more palliative) treatments are offered to frail\npatients. Clinical outcomes for frail seniors can be\nimproved with various interventions, such as compre\nhensive geriatric assessment and exercise programs\nPOTENTIAL PRECIPITANTS\nacute illness, infec\ntions, infarction, medications, social stress, environ\nmental changes, and surgical intervention. Patients\nwith frailty are at higher risk of complications, such as\nincreased mortality, morbidity, and rates of institutio\nnalization when faced with these precipitants\nCOMPREHENSIVE GERIATRICS ASSESSMENT\nIn addition to a focused history and physical, special\nattention should be paid to the following domains,\nwhich provide important information for the geriatric\nassessment:\nFUNCTIONAL HISTORY\nactivities of daily living (ADLs,\ndressing, bathing, eating, hygiene, toileting, mobility),\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, transporta\ntion, shopping, phoning, laundry, cooking, accounting,\nhousekeeping, medications), falls (number, causes, frac\ntures), mobility prior to admission (how many steps)\nGERIATRIC SYNDROMES/GIANTS\npresence/absence\nand severity of dementia, delirium, depression, falls\n(\u00021/month), osteoporosis with spontaneous fractures,\nneglect and abuse, failure to thrive, incontinence\nCOMORBID CONDITIONS\nin addition to the geria\ntric syndromes, inquire about the number and\nCOMPREHENSIVE GERIATRICS ASSESSMENT (CONT\u2019D)\nseverity of co existing diseases that are either life\nthreatening or function limiting\nPOLYPHARMACY\nnumber of medications, poten\ntial medications that can cause delirium and other\nsignificant side effects, adherence, assistance with\nmedications, drug interactions (p. 385)\nNUTRITION RISK\ndietary intake, calorie intake\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nliving situation, education, work,\nfamily, caregivers at home, financial stability, access\nto transportation, personal directives\nCOGNITIVE\nEXAMINATION\nmini mental\nstatus\nexam, clock face drawing, dementia (apraxia; aphasia;\nagnosia; abstraction similarities, proverb; executive\nsafety situational questions), CAM score (see DELIRIUM\np. 380), language (4 legged animals in 1 min.
