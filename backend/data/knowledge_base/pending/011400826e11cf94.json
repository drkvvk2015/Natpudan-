Leg cramps are com mon at night or after heavy exer-\ncise, and in patients with renal impairment or on dialysis. Cramp can signify salt de-\npletion, and rarely: muscle ischaemia (claudication, DM), myopathy (McArdle, p704), \nor dystonia (writer\u2019s cramp, p469). Forearm cramps suggest motor neuron disease. \nNight cramps may respond to quinine bisulfate 300mg at night PO.\nDrugs causing cramp: Diuretics (? from \ue001K\n+), domperidone, salbutamol/terbutaline \nIVI, ACE-i, telmisartan, celecoxib, lacidipine, ergot alkaloids, levothyroxine.\nParaesthesiae\n\u2018Pins and needles\u2019, numbness/tingling, which can hurt or \u2018burn\u2019 (dysaes th esia).\nCauses:\nMetab olic, \ue001Ca\n2+ (perioral); \ue000PaCO2; myxoedema; neurotoxins (tick bite; sting). Vascular, \n\ue022arterial emboli; Raynaud\u2019s; DVT; high plasma viscosity. Anti body-mediated, paraneo-\nplastic; SLE; ITP. Infection, rare: Lyme; rabies. Drugs, ACE-i. Brain,thalamic/parietal le-\nsions. Cord, MS; myelitis/HIV; \ue001B12; \ue022lumbar fract ure. Plexopathy/mono neuropathy, \nsee p502, cervical rib; carpal tun nel; sciatica. Peripheral neuropathy, glove & stocking, \np504, eg DM; CKD. If paroxysmal, migraine; epilepsy; phaeochromocytoma. If wander-\ning, take travel history, consider infection, eg strongyloides.\nTremor\nTremor is rhythmic oscillation of limbs, trunk, head, or tongue. Three types:\n1   Resting tremor\u2014worst at rest\u2014eg from parkinsonism (\u00b1bradykinesia and rigidity; \ntremor is more resistant to treatment than other symptoms). It is usually a slow \ntremor (frequency of 3\u20135Hz), typically \u2018pill-rolling\u2019 of the thumb over a \ufb01 nger.\n2   Postural tremor\u2014worst if arms are outstretched. Typically rapid (8\u201312Hz). May \nbe exaggerated physiological tremor (eg anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, drugs), \ndue to brain damage (eg Wilson\u2019s disease, syphilis) or benign essential tremor \n(BET). This is often familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of arms and head pre-\nsenting at any age. Cogwheeling may occur but there is no brady kinesia. It is sup-\npressed by alcohol, and patients may self-medicate rather than admit problems. \nRarely progressive (unless onset is unilateral). Propranolol (40\u201380mg/8\u201312h PO) can \nhelp, but not in all patients.\n3   Intention tremor\u2014worst on movement, seen in cerebellar disease, with past-\npointing and dysdiadochokinesis (see p499). No eff ective drug has been found.\nFacial pain\nCNS causes: Migraine, trigeminal, or glossopharyngeal neuralgia (p457) or from any \nother pain-sensitive structure in the head or neck. Post-herpetic neuralgia: nasty \nburning-and-stabbing pain involves dermatomal areas aff ected by shingles (p404); \nit may aff ect cranial nerves V and VII in the face. It all too often becomes chronic \nand intractable (skin aff ected is exquisitely sensitive). Treatment is hard. Always \ngive strong psychological support. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation, capsaicin oint-\nment, and in\ufb01 ltrating local anaesthetic are tried. Neuropathic pain agents, such as \namitriptyline, eg 10\u201325mg/24h at night, or gabapentin (p504) may help. NB: famciclo-\nvir or valaciclovir given in acute shingles may \ue001 duration of neuralgia.14\nVascular and non-neurological causes:\n  \n\u2022 Neck\u2014cervical disc pathology.\n  \n\u2022 Bone/sinuses\u2014sinusitis; neoplasia.\n  \n\u2022 Eye\u2014glaucoma; iritis; orbital cellulitis; eye strain; AVM.\n  \n\u2022 Temporomandibular joint\u2014arthritis or idiopathic dysfunction (common).\n  \n\u2022 Teeth/gums\u2014caries; broken teeth; abscess; malocclusion.\n  \n\u2022 Ear\u2014otitis media; otitis externa.\n  \n\u2022 Vascular/vasculitis\u2014arteriovenous \ufb01 stula; aneurysm; or AVM at the cerebellopon-\ntine angle; giant cell arteritis; SLE.", "text_length": 3706, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 77/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 76, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.995022", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.996015", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
