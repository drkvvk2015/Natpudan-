He introduced many nov-\nelties to the classroom, including, on one \noccasion, a gaggle of geese. We can all \nidentify with his geese, because these \nbirds show exceptional learning ability \nand resilience.\nOsler did not agree with gavage, a method \nwhereby geese (and medical students) \nare forcibly stuff ed by funnel to fatten \nthem for the delight of gluttons. We are \ntoo familiar with the three Rs of medical \neducation: Ram\ue003Remember\ue003Regurgitate, \na sequence that turns once-bright medi-\ncal students into tearful wrecks. Luckily in \nthe realm of History & Examination we can \n\ufb02 ee the library and alight at the bedside, \nbearing in mind another of Osler\u2019s aphor-\nisms: \u2018He who studies medicine without \nbooks sails an uncharted sea, but he who \nstudies medicine without patients does not \ngo to sea at all.\u2019\nWe thank Dr Petra Sulentic, our Specialist Reader, for her contribution to this chapter.", "text_length": 2087, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 36/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 35, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.918881", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.919895", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
