Prophylaxis: seek specialist advice.\n\n--- Page 473 ---\n459\nNeurology\nDespite the high prevalence of migraines, the underlying pathophysiology is \npoorly understood. The previously favoured theory of dilatation of cerebral and \nmeningeal arteries has been largely disproven, so what is the cause? \u2022 MRI dur-\ning attacks shows episodic cerebral oedema, dilatation of intra cerebral vessels, \nand \ue001 water diff usion not respecting vascular territories, so the primary event \nmay be neurological. \u2022 PET suggests migraine is a subcortical disorder aff ecting \nthe modulation of sensory processing \u2022 Magneto-encephalographic (MEG) stud-\nies have shown resting (interictal) hyperexcitability at least in the visual cortex, \nsuggesting a failure of inhibitory circuits. \u2022 Hormones play a role: the incidence of \nmigraine in both pre-pubertal and post-menopausal women is equal to men, yet \nincreases to 3:1 during reproductive years, with 50% of females reporting syn-\nchrony of migraines with the menstrual cycle. \u2022 Elevated levels of 5-HT metabo-\nlites in the urine of patients during migraine attacks was \ufb01 rst reported in 1972, \nand while its exact signi\ufb01 cance is controversial, the effi  cacy of triptans (5HT1B/1D \nagonists) support its role in migraine. \u2022 Triptans also inhibit release of substance P \nand pro-in\ufb02 ammatory neuropeptides, blocking transmission from the trigeminal \nnerve and implicating trigeminal nerve dysfunction.\nWhat is going on in migraine? \nVincent \nVan \nGogh \nsuf-\nfered from \u2018sick headaches\u2019, \nwidely believed to have been \nmigraines. Could his swirl-\ning, cascading starry night \n(\ufb01 g 10.10) be a visual aura? \n\ue007Just as with the fragile \nmental health of Van Gogh, \nmigraine \noften \nco-exists \nwith other chronic condi-\ntions\u2014and \nthe \ncombined \nnegative impact on physi-\ncal and mental health is \nimmense. Don\u2019t treat each \ndisease in isolation. Rather, \nattempt to restore a good \nrelationship with the self\u2014\nand the recovery of the pur-\npose of life through dialogue. This is the hardest but the most rewarding task, \nand may save some ears. \nThe bigger picture\nFig 10.10 \u2018The Starry Night\u2019 Vincent Van Gogh 1889\nWorld History Archive/Ann Ronan Collection / Age \nFotostock", "text_length": 2215, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 467/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 466, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.974996", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.975963", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
