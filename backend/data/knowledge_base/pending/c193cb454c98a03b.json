It uses ionizing radiation to cause damage to DNA. This \nprevents cell division and leads to cell death. The aim of radiotherapy treatment is to \ninactivate cancer cells without causing a severe reaction in normal tissue.\nRadical treatment Given with curative intent. Total dose ranges from 40\u201370 gray \n(Gy) in up to 40 fractions. Some regimens involve several smaller fractions a day \nwith a gap of 6\u20138h. Combined chemoradiation is used in some sites, eg anus and \noesophagus, to increase response rate.\nPalliative radiotherapy Aims to relieve symptoms, may not impact on survival. \nDoses are smaller and given in fewer fractions to off er short-term tumour control \nwith minimal side-eff ects. Palliation is used for brain metastases, spinal cord com-\npression, visceral compression, and bleeding, eg haemoptysis, haematuria. Bone pain \nfrom metastases can be reduced or eliminated in 60% of cases.\nEarly reactions\nOccur ~2 weeks into treatment, peak ~2\u20134 weeks after treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Tiredness: ~80%. Improves ~4 weeks after treatment completed but chronic in \n~30%. Advise patients to stay as active as possible.\n  \n\u2022 Skin reactions: Include erythema, dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and \nulceration. Aqueous cream can be used on unbroken areas.\n  \n\u2022 Mucositis: All patients receiving head and neck treatment should have a dental \ncheck-up before therapy. Avoid smoking. Antiseptic mouthwashes may help. Aspi-\nrin gargle and other soluble analgesics can be tried. Treat oral thrush with \ufb02 ucona-\nzole 50mg/24h PO, nystatin may exacerbate nausea.\n  \n\u2022 Nausea and vomiting: Occur when stomach, liver, or brain treated. Try metoclo-\npramide 10mg/8h PO (dopamine antagonist), domperidone 10mg/8h PO (blocks the \ncentral chemoreceptor trigger zone), or ondansetron 4\u20138mg/8h PO/IV (serotonin \n5HT3 antagonist) (see p251).\n  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea: Usually after abdominal or pelvic treatments. Maintain good hydration. \nAvoid high-\ufb01 bre agents. Try loperamide 2mg PO after loose stools (max 16mg/24h).\n  \n\u2022 Dysphagia: Following thoracic treatments. Speech and language input, nutrition.\n  \n\u2022 Cystitis: After pelvic treatments. Drink plenty of \ufb02 uid.\nLate reactions\nMonths-years after treatment.\n  \n\u2022 CNS/PNS: Somnolence: 4\u20136wks after brain radiotherapy. Consider \ue000steroid dose. \nSpinal cord myelopathy: progressive weakness. MRI to exclude cord comp ression. \nBrachial plexopathy: numb, weak, or painful arm after axillary radio therapy.\n  \n\u2022 Lung: Pneumonitis can occur 6\u201312wks after thoracic treatment causing dry cough \n\u00b1 dyspnoea. Bronchodilators and tapered steroids may help.\n  \n\u2022 GI: Xerostomia = reduced saliva. Dental care and nutrition important. Treat with \nwater, saliva substitutes, salivary stimulants. Benign strictures of oesophagus or \nbowel. Treat with dilatation. Seek a specialist surgical opinion regarding \ufb01 stulae. \nRadiation proctitis may be a problem after prostate irradiation.\n  \n\u2022 GU: Urinary frequency: small \ufb01 brosed bladder after pelvic treatment. Vaginal \nstenosis, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction can occur after pelvic radiotherapy. \n\ue001fertility: due to pelvic radiotherapy (see p525).\n  \n\u2022 Endocrine: Panhypopituitarism following radical treatment involving pituitary \nfossa. Check hormone pro\ufb01 le in children: growth hormone replacement may be \nrequired. Hypothyroidism in ~50% after neck treatment: check TFTs annually.\n  \n\u2022 Secondary cancers: Risk (2\u20134 per 10 000 person-years) is usually insigni\ufb01 cant \ncompared to recurrence/death from primary lesion. More important for younger \npatients after curative treatment. Women <35yrs receiving radiotherapy for Hodg-\nkin\u2019s lymphoma should be off ered breast screening from 8yrs after treatment.\n\ue007\ue000 Cancer survival means \ue000 numbers living with poor health or disability after treat-\nment (~625 000 in UK). Remember the emotional and physical impact of cancer ex-\ntends beyond the prescribed course of radiotherapy/chemotherapy.", "text_length": 4144, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 534/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 533, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.094590", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.095299", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
