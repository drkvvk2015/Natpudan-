In fact, written consent itself is not required by \nlaw, but it does constitute \u2018good medical practice\u2019 in the best interests of the patient \nand practitioner. Sometimes actions and words can imply valid consent, eg by simply \nentering into conversation or holding out an arm. If the consequences are not clear \nand the patient has capacity to give consent, you should seek informed written \nconsent as a record of your conversation.\nFor consent to be valid\n  \n\u2022 It can be given any time before the intervention/treatment is initiated. Earlier is \nbetter as this will give the patient time to think about the risks, bene\ufb01 ts, and al-\nternatives\u2014he or she may even bring forward questions on issues that you had \nnot considered relevant. Think of consent as an ongoing process throughout the \npatient\u2019s time with you, not just the moment of signing the form.\n  \n\u2022 The proposed treatment or test must be clearly understood by the patient, taking \ninto account the bene\ufb01 ts, risks (including complication rates if known), additional \nprocedures, alternative courses of action, and their consequences.\n  \n\u2022 It must be given voluntarily. This can be diffi  cult to evaluate\u2014eg when live organ \ndonation is being considered\u2014see BOX \u2018Special circumstances for consent\u2019 for other \ndiffi  cult situations.\n  \n\u2022 The doctor providing treatment or undertaking the test needs to ensure that the \npatient has given valid consent. The act of seeking consent is ultimately the respon-\nsibility of the doctor looking after the patient, though the task may be delegated \nto another health professional, as long as they are suitably trained and quali\ufb01 ed.\nCapacity relates to the ability to 1 understand, 2 retain, and 3 weigh up relevant \ninformation and 4 communicate the decision. Capacity is not a \ufb01 xed state, but is \nspeci\ufb01 c to any given time and decision\u2014a person may lack capacity to be involved \nin a particular complex decision but retain capacity to decide other aspects of their \ncare, or recover capacity as they recover from acute illness. Therefore, do not label \nanyone as unable to make a decision unless you have taken all practicable steps to \nhelp them to do so without success\u2014non-urgent decisions should always be deferred \nif there is a chance to recover capacity. When acting on behalf of a person who lacks \ncapacity, do so in their best interests and involve family members or an appointed \nsurrogate where clinical urgency allows.\nWhen taking consent\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient currently have capacity for the decision in question?\n  \n\u2022 Are you the right person to be obtaining consent?2\n  \n\u2022 Use words the patient understands and avoid jargon and abbreviations.\n  \n\u2022 Ensure that they believe your facts and can retain \u2018pros\u2019 and \u2018cons\u2019 long enough to \ninform their decision. Fact sheets/diagrams for individual operations help.\n  \n\u2022 Make sure their choice is free from pressure from others, and explain that they can \nwithdraw consent at any time after the form is signed. Some patients may view the \nconsent form as a contract from which they cannot renege.\n  \n\u2022 If the patient is illiterate, a witnessed mark does endorse valid consent. Similarly, \nif the patient is willing but physically unable to sign the consent form, then a wit-\nnessed entry into the medical notes stating so is valid.\n  \n\u2022 Remember to discuss further procedures that may become necessary during the \nproposed treatment. This avoids waking up to a nasty surprise (eg a missing testi-\ncle as in scenario 5 earlier in this topic).", "text_length": 4027, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 576/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 575, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.165709", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.166601", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
