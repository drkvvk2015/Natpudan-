Unmatched \nglobins precipitate, damaging RBC membranes, causing their haemolysis while still \nin the marrow. They are common in areas from the Mediterranean to the Far East.\nThe \ue020 thalassaemias Usually caused by point mutations in \ue020-globin genes on \nchromosome 11, leading to \ue001\ue020 chain production (\ue020+) or its absence (\ue0200). Various \ncombinations of mutations are possible (eg \ue0200/\ue0200, \ue020+/\ue020+, or \ue020+/\ue0200).\nTests: FBC, MCV, \ufb01 lm, iron, HbA2, HbF, Hb electrophoresis. MRI where myocardial \nsiderosis suspected (from iron overload). \n\ue058 thalassaemia minor or trait (eg \ue058/\ue058+; heterozygous state): this is a carrier \nstate, and is usually asymptomatic. Mild, well-tolerated anaemia (Hb >90g/L) \nwhich may worsen in pregnancy. MCV <75fL, HbA2 >3.5%, slight \ue000HbF. Often con-\nfused with iron-de\ufb01 ciency anaemia.\n\ue058 thalassaemia intermedia: describes an intermediate state with moderate anae-\nmia but not requiring transfusions. There may be splenomegaly. There are a vari-\nety of causes including mild homozygous \ue020 thalassaemia mutations, eg \ue020+/\ue020+, or \nco-inheritance of \ue020 thalassaemia trait with another haemoglobinopathy, eg HbC \nthalassaemia (one parent has the HbC trait, and the other has \ue020\n+). Sickle-cell \ue020+ \nthalassaemia produces a picture similar to sickle-cell anaemia.\n\ue058 thalassaemia major: denotes signi\ufb01 cant abnormalities in both \ue020-globin genes, \nand presents in the 1st year, with severe anaemia and failure to thrive. Extra-\nmedullary haematopoiesis (RBCS made outside the marrow) occurs in response to \nanaemia, causing characteristic head shape, eg skull bossing (\ufb01 gs 8.39, 8.40) and \nhepato spleno megaly (also due to hae molysis). There is osteopenia (may respond \nto zoledronic acid). Skull X-ray shows a \u2018hair on end\u2019 sign due to \ue000marrow activity. \nLife-long blood transfusions are needed, with resulting iron overload/deposition \nseen after ~10yrs as endocrine failure (pituitary, thyroid, pancreas\ue003diabetes mel-\nlitus), liver disease, and cardiac toxicity. The \ufb01 lm shows very hypochromic, micro-\ncytic cells + target cells + nucleated RBCs. \ue000\ue000HbF, HbA2 variable, HbA absent.\nTreatment: \ue007Promote \ufb01 tness; healthy diet. Folate supplements help. \n  \n\u2022 Regular (~2\u20134 weekly) life-long transfusions to keep Hb >90g/L, to suppress the \nineff ective extramedullary haematopoiesis and to allow normal growth. \ue007Iron \noverload is a big problem causing hypothyroidism, hypocalcaemia, and hypo-\ngonadism. Can be mitigated by iron-chelators (deferiprone PO + desferrioxamine \nsc twice weekly. SE: pain, deafness, cataracts, retinal damage, \ue000risk of Yersinia). \nLarge doses of ascorbic acid can also help by \ue000urinary excretion of iron.\n  \n\u2022 Splenectomy if hypersplenism persists with increasing transfusion requirements \n(p373)\u2014this is best avoided until >5yrs old due to risk of infections.\n  \n\u2022 Hormonal replacement or treatment for endocrine complications, eg diabetes \nmellitus, hypothyroidism. Growth hormone treatment has had variable success.\n  \n\u2022 A histocompatible marrow transplant can off er the chance of a cure. \nPrevention: Approaches include genetic counselling or antenatal diagnosis using \nfetal blood or DNA, then \u2018therapeutic\u2019 abortion.\nThe \ue025 thalassaemias (\ufb01 g 8.41) There are two separate \ue025-globin genes on each \nchromosome 16 \ue018 there are four genes (termed \ue025\ue025/\ue025\ue025). The \ue025 thalassaemias are \nmainly caused by gene deletions. If all four \ue025 genes are deleted (--/--), death is in \nutero (Bart\u2019s hydrops). Here, HbBarts (\ue0344) is present, which is physiologically use-\nless. HbH disease occurs if three genes are deleted (--/-\ue025); there may be moderate \nanaemia and features of haemolysis: hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, and jaun-\ndice. In the blood \ufb01 lm, there is formation of \ue0204 tetramers (=HbH) due to excess \ue020 \nchains, HbBarts, HbA, and HbA2. If two genes are deleted (--/\ue025\ue025 or -\ue025/-\ue025), there \nis an asymptomatic carrier state, with \ue001MCV. With one gene deleted, the clinical \nstate is normal.", "text_length": 4156, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 350/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 349, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.765162", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.766068", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
