It presents earlier \nin women (menstrual disturbance) but later in men (eg with erectile dysfunction \nand/or mass eff ects). Prolactin stimulates lactation.\n11,12 Raised levels lead to hypo-\ngonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropin-re-\nleasing hormone (hence \ue001LH/FSH and \ue001testosterone or oestrogen).\nCauses of raised plasma prolactin (PRL; >390mU/L) PRL is secreted from the an-\nterior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothal amus. \nHyperprolactinaemia may result from 1 Excess production from the pituitary, eg \nprolactinoma. 2 Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk, reducing local \ndopamine levels. 3 Use of a dopamine antagonist. A PRL of 1000\u20135000mU/L may re-\nsult from any, but >5000 is likely to be due to a prolactinoma, with macroadenomas \n(>10mm) having the highest levels, eg 10 000\u2013100 000.\n  \n\u2022 Physiological: Pregnancy; breastfeeding; stress. Acute rises occur post-orgasm.\n11\n  \n\u2022 Drugs (most common cause): Metoclop ramide; haloperidol; methyldopa; oes-\ntrogens; ecstasy/MDMA;\n12 antipsychotics (a reason for \u2018non-compliance\u2019: sustained \nhyperprolactinaemia may cause \ue001libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction). \n  \n\u2022 Diseases: Prolactinoma: micro- or macroadenoma; Stalk damage: pituitary ad-\nenomas, surgery, trauma; Hypo thalamic disease: craniopharyngioma, other tu-\nmours; Other: hypothyroidism (due to \ue000TRH), chronic renal failure (\ue001excretion).\nSymptoms \ue033: Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea; infertility; galactorrhoea (\ufb01 g 5.27). \nAlso: \ue001libido, \ue000weight, dry vagina. \ue032: Erectile dysfunction, \ue001facial hair, galactorrhoea. \nMay present late with osteoporosis or local pressure eff ects from the tumour (p234).\nTests Basal PRL: non-stressful venepuncture between 09.00 and 16.00h. Do a preg-\nnancy test, TFT, U&E. MRI pituitary if other causes are ruled out.\nManagement Refer to a specialist endocrinology clinic. Dopamine agonists (bro-\nmocriptine or cabergoline) are 1st line.\nMicroprolactinomas: A tumour <10mm on MRI (~25% of us have asymptomatic \nmicroprolactinomas). Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, \ue001PRL secretion, restores \nmenstrual cycles and \ue001tumour size. Dose is titrated up: 1.25mg PO; increase weekly \nby 1.25\u20132.5mg/d until ~2.5mg/12h. SE: nausea, depression, postural hypotension (mini-\nmize by giving at night). If pregnancy is planned, use barrier contraception until 2 \nperiods have occurred. If subsequent pregnancy occurs, stop bromocriptine after \nthe 1st missed period. An alternative dopamine agonist is cabergoline: more eff ec-\ntive and fewer SE, but there are fewer data on safety in pregnancy. NB: ergot alkaloids \n(bromocriptine and cabergoline) can cause \ufb01 brosis (eg echocardiograms are need-\ned). Trans-sphenoidal surgery may be considered if intolerant of dopamine agonists. \nIt has a high success rate, but there are risks of permanent hormone de\ufb01 ciency and \nprolactinoma recurrence, and so it is usually reserved as a 2nd-line treatment.\nMacroprolactinomas: A tumour >10mm diameter on MRI. As they are near the optic \nchiasm, there may be \ue001acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, visual-\ufb01 eld loss, and op-\ntic atrophy. Treat initially with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine if fertility is the \ngoal). Surgery is rarely needed , but consider if visual symptoms or pressure eff ects \nwhich fail to respond to medical treatment. Bromocriptine, and in some cases radia-\ntion therapy, may be required post-op as complete surgical resection is uncommon. \nIf pregnant, monitor closely ideally in a combined endocrine/antenatal clinic as there \nis \ue000risk of expansion.\nFollow-up Monitor PRL. If headache or visual loss, check \ufb01 elds (? do MRI). Medication \ncan be decreased after 2yrs, but recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia and expansion \nof the tumour may occur, and so these patients should be monitored carefully.\n11 The prolactin increase (\ue032 and \ue033) after coitus is ~400% greater than after masturbation; post-orgasmic \nprolactin is part of a feedback loop decreasing arousal by inhibiting central dopaminergic processes. The \nsize of post-orgasmic prolactin increase is a neurohormonal index of sexual satisfaction.\n12 MDMA also \ue000oxytocin; prolactin + oxytocin are thought to mediate post-orgasmic well-being.", "text_length": 4413, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 244/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 243, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.421923", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.422640", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
