Indica-\ntions for AXR with acute abdominal symptoms:\n  \n\u2022 Suspicion of obstruction (or intussusception, eg in paediatrics).\n  \n\u2022 Acute \ufb02 are of in\ufb02 ammatory bowel disease (eg to con\ufb01 rm/exclude megacolon).\n  \n\u2022 Renal colic with known renal stones (if \ufb01 rst presentation, CT KUB is better).\n  \n\u2022 Ingestion of a sharp or poisonous foreign body (eg lithium battery).\nBowel gas pattern is best assessed on supine images and free intraperitoneal gas \n(signifying perforation) is best seen on an erect CXR (\ufb01 g 13.26, p607).\nGas patterns Look for: an abnormal quantity of gas in the stomach, small intestine, \nor colon. Decide whether you are looking at small or large bowel (\ufb01 g 16.8; table 16.3).\nSmall bowel diameter is normally ~2.5cm, the colon ~5cm, the caecum up to 10cm. Di-\nlated small bowel is seen in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Dilated large bowel (\ue0066cm) \nis seen in both these, and also in \u2018toxic dilatation\u2019, and, in the elderly, in benign hypoto-\nnicity. Grossly dilated segments of bowel (coff ee bean sign) are seen in sigmoid and \ncaecal volvulae\u2014\ufb01 g 13.28c, p611. Loss of normal mucosal folds and bowel wall thicken-\ning are seen in in\ufb02 ammatory colitis (eg IBD)\u2014\ufb01 g 16.9. \u2018Thumb-printing\u2019 is protrusion of \nthickened mural folds into the lumen, seen in large bowel ischaemia and colitis.\nTable 16.3 Radiological gas patterns in the bowel\nSmall bowel\nLarge bowel\nIleus\n \u2022 Smaller calibre\n \u2022 Central; multiple loops\n \u2022 Valvuli conniventes:\nfolds that go from wall to wall, all \nthe way across the lumen; more \nregular and \ufb01 ner than haustra\n \u2022 Grey (contains air and \ufb02 uid)\n \u2022 Larger calibre\n \u2022 Peripheral\n \u2022 Semi-lunar folds:* don\u2019t go \nall the way across the lu-\nmen, but may appear to do \nso if viewed from an angle\n \u2022 Blacker (contains gas)\u2020\n \u2022 Both small and \nlarge bowel visible\n \u2022 There is no clear \ntransition point \nthat corresponds \nto an obstructing \nlesion\n*Semi-lunar folds (plicae semilunares) lie in between adjacent haustra.\n\u2020The ascending colon contains liquid faeces, but the descending colon contains faecal pellets (scybala).\nGas outside the lumen You must explain any gas outside the lumen of the gut. It \ncould be: 1 Pneumoperitoneum; signs on the supine AXR include: gas on both sides of \nthe bowel wall (Rigler\u2019s sign), a triangle of gas in the RUQ trapped beneath the falci-\nform ligament, and a circle of gas beneath the anterior abdominal wall. Seen with \nbowel perforation but also after laparoscopic surgery. 2 Gas in the urinary tract\u2014eg \nin the bladder from a \ufb01 stula. 3 Gas in the biliary tree (see next paragraph), or rarely \n4 Intramural gas, found in bowel necrosis.\nBiliary tree Any stones: ~10% visible on plain AXR. Any gas: (Pneumobilia.) Caused \nby: \u2022post-ERCP/sphincterotomy \u2022post-surgery (eg Whipple\u2019s) \u2022recent stone passage \n\u2022anaerobic cholangitis (rare) \u2022gallbladder\u2013bowel \ufb01 stula: gallstone migrates directly \ninto the bowel (Rigler\u2019s triad is seen in 25%: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, \nan ectopic gallstone). Calci\ufb01 cation: (\u2018Porcelain gallbladder\u2019.) Chronic in\ufb02 ammation \nfrom gallstones (associated with gallbladder cancer).\nUrinary tract Check for calculi (visible in 90% of cases)\n1 and normal anatomy: Kidneys: \nLength equivalent to 2\u00bd\u20133\u00bd vertebral bodies, slope inferolaterally. Right is lower than \nthe left (\u2018pushed down\u2019 by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding \nlayer of perinephric fat. Ureters: Pass near the tips of the lumbar transverse processes, \ncross the sacroiliac joints, down to the ischial spines, and turn medially to join the bladder.\nOther soft tissues Look for size/position of: liver, spleen, and bladder. A big liver \nwill push bowel to the left side of the abdomen. An enlarged spleen displaces bowel \nand stomach bubble to the right. A big bladder elevates these.\nMedical devices Double-J and biliary stents, nephrostomy and gastrostomy tubes, \nintrauterine devices, laparoscopic clips, and peritoneal dialysis catheters can be seen.\nBones and joints Plain AXR is not ideal, but there may be important abnormalities. \nIn the lumbar spine, look for scoliosis and degeneration (osteophytes, joint space \nnarrowing) as well as bone metastases or sacroiliitis.\n1 Don\u2019t get confused by other calci\ufb01 cations\u2014eg phleboliths: harmless calci\ufb01 cations found in the perivesical \nveins (rounded with a radiolucent centre).", "text_length": 4524, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 736/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 735, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.440640", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.441482", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
