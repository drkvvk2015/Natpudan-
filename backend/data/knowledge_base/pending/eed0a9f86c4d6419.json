Explain that they \nmay feel ill on waking. The premedication aims to allay anxiety and to make the \nanaesthesia itself easier to conduct (see BOX). Typical regimens might include:\n  \n\u2022 Anxiolytics: Benzodiazepines, eg lorazepam 2mg PO; temazepam 10\u201320mg PO. In \nchildren, use oral premeds as \ufb01 rst choice, eg midazolam 0.5mg/kg (tastes bitter so \noften put in paracetamol suspension). Give oral premedication 2h before surgery \n(1h if IM route used).\n  \n\u2022 Analgesics: See p574. Pre-emptive analgesia is not often used and eff ects are hard \nto determine. The aim is to dampen pain signals before they arrive. In children or \nanxious adults, local anaesthetic cream may be used on a few sites before inserting \nan IVI (\ue007the anaesthetist may prefer to site the cannula themselves!).\n  \n\u2022 Anti-emetics: Post-operative nausea and vomiting is experienced by ~25% of \nall patients. 5HT3 antagonists (eg ondansetron 4mg IV/IM) are the most eff ective \nagents; others, eg metoclopramide 10mg/8h IV/IM/PO, are also used\u2014see p251.\n  \n\u2022 Antacids: Ranitidine 50mg IV or omeprazole 40mg PO/IV if aspiration risk.\n  \n\u2022 Antisialogues: Glycopyrronium (200\u2013400mcg in adults, 4\u20138mcg/kg in children; \ngiven IV/IM 30\u201360min before induction) is sometimes used to decrease secretions \nthat may cause respiratory obstruction in smaller airways.\n  \n\u2022 Antibiotics: See p570.\nSide-eff ects of anaesthetic agents\n  \n\u2022 Hyoscine, atropine: Anticholinergic, \ue018 tachycardia, urinary retention, glaucoma, \nsedation (especially in the elderly).\n  \n\u2022 Opioids: Respiratory depression, \ue001cough re\ufb02 ex, nausea and vomiting, constipation.\n  \n\u2022 Thiopental: (Induction agent.) Laryngospasm.\n  \n\u2022 Propofol: (Induction agent.) Respiratory/cardiac depression, pain on injection.\n  \n\u2022 Volatile agents, eg iso\ufb02 urane: Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respira-\ntory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF).\nThe complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of:\n  \n\u2022 Pain sensation: Urinary retention, pressure necrosis, local nerve injuries (eg radial \nnerve palsy from arm hanging over the table edge).\n  \n\u2022 Consciousness: Cannot communicate \u2018wrong leg/kidney\u2019. NB: in some patients (eg \n0.15%) retained consciousness is the problem. Awareness under GA sounds like a \ncontradiction of terms, but remember that anaesthesia is a process rather than an \nevent. Such awareness can lead to ill-de\ufb01 ned, delayed neuroses and post-traumatic \nstress disorder (OHCS p353).\n  \n\u2022 Muscle power: Corneal abrasion (\ue018 tape the eyes closed), no respiration, no cough \n(leads to pneumonia and atelectasis\u2014partial lung collapse causing shunting \u00b1 im-\npaired gas exchange: it starts minutes after induction, and may be related to the \nuse of 100% O2, supine position, surgery, age, and to loss of power).\nLocal/regional anaesthesia If un\ufb01 t/unwilling to undergo general anaesthesia, lo-\ncal nerve blocks (eg brachial plexus) or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagula-\ntion, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be \nindicated. See table 13.4 for doses and toxicity eff ects.\nDrugs complicating anaesthesia \ue007Inform anaesthetist. See p566 for lists of spe-\nci\ufb01 c drugs, and actions to take.\nMalignant hyperpyrexia This is a rare complication, precipitated by any volatile \nagent, eg halothane, or suxamethonium. It exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. \nThere is a rapid rise in temperature (>1\u00b0C every 30min); masseter spasm may be an \nearly sign. Complications include hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, hyperkalaemia, meta-\nbolic acidosis, and arrhythmias. \ue007Get expert help immediately. Prompt treatment \nwith dantrolene\n3 (skeletal muscle relaxant), active cooling and ITU care can reduce \nmortality signi\ufb01 cantly. \n3 Give 1mg/kg every 5min IV\u2014up to 10mg/kg in total (OHCS p628).", "text_length": 4011, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 580/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 579, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.173602", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.175159", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
