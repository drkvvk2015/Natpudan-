If \nyou are screening, wear a protective lead apron.\n  \n\u2022 Insertion: Using an aseptic technique, place the introducer into the (ideally right) \ninternal jugular vein (p775) or subclavian. If this is diffi  cult, access to the right \natrium can be achieved via the femoral vein. Pass the pacing wire through the \nintroducer into the right atrium, ideally under radiological screening. It will either \npass easily through the tricuspid valve or loop within the atrium. If the latter oc-\ncurs, it is usually possible to \ufb02 ip the wire across the valve with a combined twisting \nand withdrawing movement (\ufb01 g 18.19). Advance the wire slightly. At this stage the \nwire may try to exit the ventricle through the pulmonary out\ufb02 ow tract. A further \nwithdrawing and rotation of the wire will aim the tip at the apex of the right ven-\ntricle. Advance slightly again to place the wire in contact with the endocardium. \nRemove any slack to \ue001risk of subsequent displacement.\n  \n\u2022 Checking the threshold: Connect the wire to the pacing box and set the \u2018demand\u2019 \nrate slightly higher than the patient\u2019s own heart rate and the output to 3V. A paced \nrhythm should be seen. Find the pacing threshold by slowly reducing the voltage \nuntil the pacemaker fails to stimulate the tissue (pacing spikes are no longer fol-\nlowed by paced beats). The threshold should be less than 1V, but a slightly higher \nvalue may be acceptable if it is stable\u2014eg after a large infarction.\n  \n\u2022 Setting the pacemaker: Set the output to 3V or over 3 times the threshold value \n(whichever is higher) in \u2018demand\u2019 mode. Set the rate as required. Suture the wire to \nthe skin, and \ufb01 x with a sterile dressing.\n  \n\u2022 Check the position of the wire (and exclude pneumothorax) with a CXR.\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent checks of the pacing threshold are required over the next few days. The \nformation of endocardial oedema can raise the threshold by a factor of 2\u20133.\nComplications Pneumothorax; sepsis; cardiac perforation; pacing failure: from loss \nof capture, loss of electrical continuity in pacing circuit, or electrode displacement.", "text_length": 4152, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 784/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 783, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.532882", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.533574", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
