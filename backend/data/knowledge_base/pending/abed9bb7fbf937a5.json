Use imaging studies to con\ufb01 rm the likely source.\n1st-line tests Overnight dexamethasone suppression test is a good outpatient \ntest. Dexamethasone 1mg PO at midnight; do serum cortisol at 8AM. Normally, \ncortisol suppresses to <50nmol/L; no suppression in Cushing\u2019s syndrome. False \u03a9ve \nrate: <2%; false +ves: 2% normal, 13% obese, and 23% of inpatients. NB: false +ves \n(pseudo -Cushing\u2019s) are seen in depression, obesity, alcohol excess, and inducers of \nliver enzymes (\ue000rate of dexamethasone metabolism, eg phenytoin, phenobarbital, ri-\nfampicin, p689). 24h urinary free cortisol (normal: <280nmol/24h) is an alternative.\n2nd-line tests If 1st-line tests abnormal: 48h dexamethasone suppression test: \nGive dexamethasone 0.5mg/6h PO for 2d. Measure cortisol at 0 and 48h (last test \nat 6h after last dose). Again, in Cushing\u2019s syndrome, there is a failure to suppress \ncortisol. 48h high-dose dexamethasone suppression test: (2mg/6h.) May distin-\nguish pituitary (suppression) from others causes (no/part suppression). Midnight \ncortisol: Admit (unless salivary cortisol used). Often inaccurate due to measure-\nment issues. Normal circadian rhythm (cortisol lowest at midnight, highest early \nmorning) is lost in Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Midnight blood, via a cannula during sleep, \nshows cortisol \ue000 in Cushing\u2019s.\nLocalization tests (Where is the lesion?) If the 1st- and 2nd-line tests are +ve\u2014\nPlasma ACTH. If ACTH is undetectable, an adrenal tumour is likely \ue003 CT/MRI adrenal \nglands. If no mass, proceed to adrenal vein sampling. If ACTH is detectable, dis-\ntinguish a pituitary cause from ectopic ACTH production by high-dose suppression \ntest or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test: 100mcg ovine or human CRH \nIV. Measure cortisol at 120min. Cortisol rises with pituitary disease but not with \nectopic ACTH production. \nIf tests indicate that cortisol responds to manipulation, Cushing\u2019s disease is \nlikely. Image the pituitary (MRI) and consider bilateral inferior petrosal sinus \nblood sampling.\nIf tests indicate that cortisol does not respond to manipulation, hunt for the \nsource of ectopic ACTH\u2014eg IV contrast CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis \u00b1 MRI of \nneck, thorax, and abdomen, eg for small ACTH secreting carcinoid tumours.\nInvestigating suspected Cushing\u2019s syndrome\nFig 5.20 Hypercortisolism weakens skin; \neven normal stretching (or the pressure of \nobesity, as here) can make its elastin break\u2014\non healing we see these depressed purple \nscars (striae).
