Shaking hands can \ntell you about thyroid disease (warm, sweaty, tremor), anxiety (cold, sweaty), and \nneurological disease (myotonic dystrophy patients have diffi  culty relaxing their grip, \na weak grip may suggest muscle wasting or peripheral neuropathy). The nails and \nskin can inform about systemic disease:\nNail abnormalities\n  \n\u2022 Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, \ufb01 g 2.40) suggests \niron de\ufb01 ciency, haemochromatosis, infection (eg \nfungal), endocrine disorders (eg acromegaly, hypo-\nthyroidism), or malnutrition.\n  \n\u2022 Onycholysis (detachment of the nail from the nail-\nbed) is seen with hyper thyroidism, fungal infection, \nand psoriasis.\n  \n\u2022 Beau\u2019s lines (\ufb01 g 2.41) are transverse furrows from \ntemporary arrest of nail growth at times of biologi-\ncal stress: severe infection. Nails grow at ~0.1mm/d, \nthe furrow\u2019s distance from the cuticle allows dating \nof the stress.\n  \u2022 Mees\u2019 lines are single white transverse bands clas-\nsically seen in arsenic poisoning, chronic kidney dis-\nease, and carbon monoxide poisoning among others.\n  \n\u2022 Muehrcke\u2019s lines are paired white parallel trans-\nverse bands (without furrowing of the nail itself, \ndistinguishing them from Beau\u2019s lines) seen, eg, in \nchronic hypoalbuminaemia, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, pel-\nlagra (p268), chronic kidney disease.\n  \n\u2022 Terry\u2019s nails: Proximal portion of nail is white/\npink, nail tip is red/brown (causes include cirrhosis, \nchronic kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure).\n  \n\u2022 Pitting is seen in psoriasis and alopecia areata.\n  \n\u2022 Splinter haemorrhages (\ufb01 g 2.42) are \ufb01 ne longitudi-\nnal haemorrhagic streaks (under the nails), which in \nthe febrile patient may suggest infective endocardi-\ntis. They may be microemboli, or be normal\u2014eg due \nto gardening.\n  \n\u2022 Nail-fold infarcts: Embolic, typically seen in vascu-\nlitic disorders (OHCS, p452).\n  \n\u2022 Nail clubbing See p77.\n  \n\u2022 Chronic paronychia is a chronic infection of the \nnail-fold and presents as a painful swollen nail with \nintermittent discharge (\ufb01 g 2.43).\nSkin changes\n  \n\u2022 Palmar erythema (\ufb01 g 2.44) is associated with cir-\nrhosis, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid \narthritis, polycythaemia; also chronic liver disease\u2014\nvia \ue001inactivation of vasoactive endotoxins by the \nliver. Also chemotherapy-induced palmar/plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia.\n  \n\u2022 Pallor of the palmar creases suggests anaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Pigmentation of the palmar creases is normal in \npeople of African-Caribbean or Asian origin but \nis also seen in Addison\u2019s disease and Nelson\u2019s syn-\ndrome (increased ACTH after removal of the adrenal \nglands in Cushing\u2019s disease).15\n  \n\u2022 Gottron\u2019s papules (purple rash on the knuckles) \nwith dilated end-capillary loops at the nail fold sug-\ngests dermatomyositis (p552). \nFig 2.40 Koilonychia.\nFig 2.44  Palmar erythema.\nFig 2.41 Beau\u2019s lines, here due \nto chemotherapy, a new line is \nseen with each cycle.
