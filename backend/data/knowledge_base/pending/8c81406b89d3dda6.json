Remember bilateral adrenal haemorrhage (eg meningococcaemia) as \na cause. An alternative presentation is with hypoglycaemia.\nPrecipitating factors Infection, trauma, surgery, missed medication.\nManagement If suspected, treat before biochemical results.\n  \n\u2022 Bloods for cortisol and ACTH (this needs to go straight to laboratory, call ahead!), \nU&ES\u2014can have \ue000K\n+ (check ECG and give calcium gluconate if needed, see p301) and \n\ue001Na\n+ (salt depletion, should resolve with rehydration and steroids).\n  \n\u2022 Hydrocortisone 100mg IV stat.\n  \n\u2022 IV \ufb02 uid bolus eg 500mL 0.9% saline to support BP, repeated as necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor blood glucose: the danger is hypoglycaemia.\n  \n\u2022 Blood, urine, sputum for culture, then antibiotics if concern about infection.\nContinuing treatment\n  \n\u2022 Glucose IV may be needed if hypoglycaemic.\n  \n\u2022 Give IV \ufb02 uids as guided by clinical state and to correct U&E imbalance.\n  \n\u2022 Continue hydrocortisone, eg 100mg/8h IV or IM.\n  \n\u2022 Change to oral steroids after 72h if patient\u2019s condition good.\n  \n\u2022 Fludrocortisone may well be needed if the cause is adrenal disease: ask an expert.\n  \n\u2022 Search for (and vigorously treat) the underlying cause. Get endocrinological help.\nHypopituitary coma\nThink of decompensated chronic hypophyseal failure whenever hypothermia, refrac-\ntory hypotension \u00b1 septic signs without fever occur with short stat ure or loss of \naxillary/pubic hair \u00b1 gonadal atrophy. \ue007Waiting for lab con\ufb01 rmation may be fatal. It \nusually develops gradually in a person with known hypopituitarism. If rapid onset \ndue to pituitary infarction (eg postpartum, Sheehan\u2019s, p232), subarachnoid haemor-\nrhage is often misdiagnosed as symptoms include headache and meningism.\nPresentation Headache; ophthalmoplegia; \ue001consciousness; hypotension; hypo-\nthermia; hypoglycaemia; signs of hypopituitarism (p232).\nTests Cortisol; T4; TSH; ACTH; glucose. Pituitary fossa CT/MRI.\nTreatment \ue007Hydrocortisone, eg 100mg IV/6h.\n  \n\u2022 Only after hydrocortisone begun: liothyronine (L-tri-iodothyronine sodium), eg \n10mcg/12h PO or by slow IV: 5\u201320mcg/12h (4-hourly may be needed).\n  \n\u2022 Prompt surgery is needed if the cause is pituitary apoplexy (p234).", "text_length": 2609, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 844/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 843, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.641644", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.642443", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
