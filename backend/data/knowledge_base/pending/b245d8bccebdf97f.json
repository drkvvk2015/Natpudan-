It is characterized by recurrent episodes of \ndyspnoea, cough, and wheeze caused by reversible airways obstruction. Three fac-\ntors contribute to airway narrowing: bronchial muscle contraction, triggered by a \nvariety of stimuli; mucosal swelling/in\ufb02 ammation, caused by mast cell and basophil \ndegranulation resulting in the release of in\ufb02 ammatory mediators; and increased \nmucus production.\nSymptoms Intermittent dyspnoea, wheeze, cough (often nocturnal), and sputum \n(see table 4.5).\nPrecipitants: Cold air, exercise, emotion, allergens (house dust mite, pollen, fur), \ninfection, smoking and passive smoking,29 pollution, NSAIDS, \ue020-blockers.\nDiurnal variation Symptoms or peak \ufb02 ow may vary over the day. Marked morning \ndipping of peak \ufb02 ow is common and can tip the balance into a serious attack, despite \nhaving normal peak \ufb02 ow (\ufb01 g 4.12) at other times.\nExercise: Quantify the exercise tolerance.\nDisturbed sleep: Quantify as nights per week (a sign of severe asthma).\nAcid re\ufb02 ux: 40\u201360% of those with asthma have re\ufb02 ux; treating it improves spirom-\netry, but not necessarily symptoms. 30\nOther atopic disease: Eczema, hay fever, allergy, or family history?\nThe home (especially the bedroom): Pets? Carpet? Feather pillows or duvet? Floor \ncushions and other \u2018soft furnishings\u2019?\nJob: If symptoms remit at weekends or holidays, work may provide the trigger (15% \nof cases are work-related\u2014more for paint sprayers, food processors, welders, and \nanimal handlers). 31 Ask the patient to measure their peak \ufb02 ow at intervals at work \nand at home (at the same time of day) to con\ufb01 rm this (see \ufb01 g 4.13).\nDays per week off work or school.\nSigns Tachypnoea; audible wheeze; hyperin\ufb02 ated chest; hyper-resonant percus-\nsion note; \ue001air entry; widespread, polyphonic wheeze. Severe attack: Inability to \ncomplete sentences; pulse >110bpm; respiratory rate >25/min; PEF 33\u201350% predicted. \nLife-threatening attack: Silent chest; confusion; exhaustion; cyanosis (PaO2 <8kPa \nbut PaCO2 4.6\u20136.0, SpO2 <92%); brady cardia; PEF <33% predicted. Near fatal: \ue000PaCO2.\nTests Initial diagnosis: See \ufb01 gs 4.10, 4.11. Acute attack: PEF, sputum culture, FBC, \nU&E, CRP, blood cultures. ABG analysis usually shows a normal or slightly \ue001PaO2 but \n\ue001PaCO2 (hyperventilation). If PaO2 is normal but the patient is hyperventilating, watch \ncarefully and repeat the ABG a little later. \ue007If PaCO2 is normal or raised, transfer \nto high-dependency unit or ITU for ventilation, as this signi\ufb01 es failing respiratory \neff ort. CXR (to exclude infection or pneumothorax). Chronic asthma: PEF monitoring \n(p162): a diurnal variation of >20% on \u22653d a wk for 2wks. Spirometry: obstructive \ndefect (\ue001FEV1/FVC, \ue000RV p162); usually \u226515% improvement in FEV1 following \ue0202 agonists \nor steroid trial. CXR: hyperin\ufb02 ation. Skin-prick tests may help to identify allergens. \nHistamine or methacholine challenge. Aspergillus serology.\nDiff erential diagnosis Pulmonary oedema (\u2018cardiac asthma\u2019); COPD (may co-exist); \nlarge airway obstruction (eg foreign body, tumour); SVC obstruction (wheeze/dys-\npnoea not episodic); pneumothorax; PE; bronchiectasis; obliterative bronchiolitis \n(suspect in elderly).\nTreatment Chronic asthma (p182). Emergency treatment (p810).\nAssociated diseases Acid re\ufb02 ux; polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, p556); Churg\u2013Strauss \nsyndrome (p696); ABPA (p177).\nNatural history Most childhood asthmatics (see OHCS p164) either grow out of \nasthma in adolescence or suff er much less as adults. A signi\ufb01 cant number of people \ndevelop chronic asthma late in life.\nMortality ~900 asthma deaths in the UK in 2012, 50% were >65yrs old.", "text_length": 3742, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 186/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 185, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.238395", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.239351", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
