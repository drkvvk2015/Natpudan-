Ionizing radiation (eg X-rays) during preg-\nnancy, and Down\u2019s syndrome are important associations. It is the commonest cancer \nof childhood, and is rare in adults. CNS involvement is common.\nClassi\ufb01 cation Based on three systems:\n1  Morphological: The FAB system (French, American, British) divides ALL into three types \n(L1, L2, L3) by microscopic appearance. Provides limited information (\ufb01 gs 8.45\u20138.48).\n2   Immunological: Surface markers are used to classify ALL into:\n\u2022 Precursor B-cell ALL \u2022 T-cell ALL \u2022 B-cell ALL.\n3   Cytogenetic: Chromosomal analysis. Abnormalities are detected in up to 85%, \nwhich are often translocations.\n6 Useful for predicting prognosis, eg poor with \nPhiladelphia chromosome (p358), and for detecting disease recurrence.\nSigns and symptoms (\ufb01 g 8.49) Due to:\n  \n\u2022 Marrow failure: anaemia (\ue001Hb), infection (\ue001WCC), and bleeding (\ue001platelets).\n  \n\u2022 In\ufb01 ltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy\u2014super\ufb01 cial or medi-\nastinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement\u2014eg cranial nerve palsies, meningism.\nCommon infections: Especially chest, mouth, perianal, and skin. Bacterial septi-\ncaemia, zoster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (p400).\nTests \u2022 Characteristic blast cells on blood \ufb01 lm and bone marrow. WCC usually high.\n  \n\u2022 CXR and CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.\n  \n\u2022 Lumbar puncture should be performed to look for CNS involvement.\nTreatment \ue007Educate and motivate patient to promote engagement with therapy.\n  \n\u2022 Support: Blood/platelet transfusion, IV \ufb02 uids, allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis \nsyndrome). Insert a subcutaneous port system/Hickman line for IV access. \n  \n\u2022 Infections: These are dangerous, due to neutropenia caused by the disease and \ntreatment: give immediate IV antibiotics. Start the neutropenic regimen (p352) and \ngive prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics.\n  \n\u2022 Chemotherapy: Complex multi-drug, multi-phase regimens that may take years:\n  \n\u2022 Remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + daunorubicin.\n  \n\u2022 Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in \u2018blocks\u2019 over several weeks.\n  \n\u2022 CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate \u00b1 CNS irradiation.\n  \n\u2022 Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrex-\nate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs. Relapse is common \nin blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up). More details: OHCS p194.\n  \n\u2022 Matched related allogeneic marrow transplantations: Once in 1st remission is \nthe best option in standard-risk younger adults.\nHaematological remission: Means no evidence of leukaemia in the blood, a normal \nor recovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow.\nPrognosis Cure rates for children are 70\u201390%; for adults only 40% (higher when \nimatinib/rituximab, p358, are used). Poor prognosis if: adult, male, Philadelphia chro-\nmosome (p358: BCR\u2013ABL gene fusion due to translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22), \npresentation with CNS signs, \ue001Hb , WCC >100\u224810\n9/L , or B-cell ALL. PCR is used to detect \nminimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means. Prognosis in relapsed \nPh-negative ALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant). \nPersonalized treatment \ue007One size does not \ufb01 t all!  Aim to tailor therapy to the \nexact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies, \ngene-targeted retinoids, cytokines, vaccines, and T-cell infusions are relevant here.  \nBiomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase, can predict toxicity from thiopurines. \n6 Eg t(12:21) ETV6-RUNX1, t(1;19) TCF3-PBX1, t(9;22) BCR-ABL1, and rearrangement of MLL.", "text_length": 3997, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 362/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 361, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.787986", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.788787", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
