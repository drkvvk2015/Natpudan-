If post menopausal, look for a \nurethral caruncle\u2014\ufb02 eshy outgrowth of distal urethral mucosa, \ue0051cm, typically origi-\nnating from the posterior urethral lip. Also think of prostatitis, STI/urethritis (p413), \nvaginitis, and vulvitis. Rare causes: Stones, urethral lesions (eg car cinoma, lympho-\nma, papilloma), post-partum complications (eg retained products of conception).\nVoiding diffi  culty is a sign of out\ufb02 ow obstruction, eg from an enlarged prostate, \nor urethral stricture (commonly post-traumatic, post-gonococcal). Other features: \nstraining to void, poor stream, urinary retention, and incontinence. Stran gury is \nurethral pain, usually referred from the bladder base, causing a constant dist res sing \ndesire to urinate even if there is little urine to void. Causes: Stones, catheters, cys-\ntitis, prostat itis, bladder neoplasia, rarely: bladder endometriosis, schistosomiasis.\nDysuria\ni = irritative (or \u2018\ufb01 lling\u2019) symptoms: they can be caused by, for example, UTI, as well as obstructions.", "text_length": 3482, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 92/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 91, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.020125", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.021222", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
