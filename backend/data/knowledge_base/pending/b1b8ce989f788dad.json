P. falciparum can be rapidly fatal\nand must be ruled out in all febrile travelers returning\nfrom malaria endemic regions. It has the shortest\nincubation period and >90% of affected travelers\nwill become ill within 30 days of return\n\u0002\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nanopheline\nmosquito\nbite\ntransmits sporozoites ! travel to liver and invade\nhepatocytes ! divide and form schizonts which\ncontain merozoites (asymptomatic) ! rupture\nafter 6 16 days and release merozoites into the\nbloodstream ! infect erythrocytes and mature\nfrom ring forms to trophozoites to mature schi\nzonts (asexual form) over 48 (P. vivax, P. ovale,\nP. falciparum) or 72 (P. malariae) hours ! mero\nzoites released from erythrocytes (fever, anemia,\nlactic acidosis, cytokine release) and infect new red\ncells ! few merozoites differentiate into male or\nfemale gametocytes (sexual forms) can circulate in\nblood until ingested by mosquito. P. vivax and\nP. ovale may stay dormant in the liver as hypno\nzoites and may cause late relapse by reactivating\nafter many months. In contrast, P. falciparum and\nP. malariae have no liver stage and do not cause\nrelapse. P. falciparum specifically can induce\nobstruction of microvascular blood flow, and may\nlead to organ dysfunction (e.g. cerebral malaria,\nrenal failure, ARDS, hypoglycemia, anemia, DIC,\nand gastroenteritis)\n\u0002\nCLINICAL\nFEATURES\nP.\nfalciparum\nis\nacquired\nmostly from sub Saharan Africa, while P. vivax is\nmostly from Asia or Latin America. Symptoms\ninclude spiking fevers, chills, headache, back\npain, cough, GI problems. Splenomegaly and\nthrombocytopenia without leukocytosis may be\npresent. Cerebral malaria (P. falciparum) presents\nas altered level of consciousness or seizures and is\nuniversally fatal if untreated\n\u0002\nDIAGNOSIS\nthick and thin smear (need to repeat\nover 48 h to rule out malaria)\n\u0002\nPROPHYLAXIS\nthe\nrelative\nrisk\nof\ncontracting\nmalaria varies by geographic region: Caribbean 4,\nNorth Africa 7, South America 8, Southeast Asia 12,\nCentral America 38, South Asia 54, Oceania 77, and\nsub Saharan Africa 208. Travelers should be advised\nto wear long sleeves/pants between dusk and\ndawn, use mosquito repellents containing 30 50%\nDEET, and consider permethrin treated mosquito\nnets. Chloroquine may be used for travel to destina\ntions with chloroquine sensitive P. falciparum (e.g.\nSPECIFIC ENTITIES (CONT\u2019D)\nmost of Central America and parts of the Middle\nEast). For destinations where chloroquine resistant\nP. falciparum is present, chemoprophylaxis with\natovaquone proguanil, mefloquine, or doxycy\ncline should be used. Give atovaquone proguanil\nor doxycycline for travel to destinations with\nP. falciparum resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine,\nand sulfonamides (e.g. regions of Thailand, Cambo\ndia, China, Laos, and Vietnam). Atavaquone pro\nguanil associated with fewest side effects. Meflo\nquine has ease of weekly dosing. Doxycycline is\nthe cheapest, but requires prolonged course and\ncauses sun sensitization.
