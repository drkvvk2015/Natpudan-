If the patient is conscious, turn off  any IVI (until \ufb02 uid is \nchecked: a mistake may have been made) and ask the patient how he or she is. \nAny \ufb01 ts, faints, collapses, or unexpected symptoms?\n  \n\u2022 Be sceptical of an unexpectedly, wildly abnormal result with a well patient. Com-\npare with previous values. Could the specimens have got muddled up; whose is \nit? Is there an artefact? Was the sample taken from the \u2018drip\u2019 arm? Is a low cal-\ncium due to a low albumin (p676)? Perhaps the lab is using a new analyser with a \nfaulty wash cycle? \ue007When in doubt, seek help and repeat the test.\nThe following values are somewhat arbitrary and must be taken as a guide only. \nMany results less extreme than those listed will be just as dangerous if the patient \nis old, immunosuppressed, or has some other pathology such as pneumonia.\nPlasma biochemistry:\n\ue022The main risks when plasma electrolytes are dangerously abnormal (table 14.3) \nare of cardiac arrhythmias and CNS events such as seizures.\nTable 14.3 Dangerous levels of the common serum elecrolytes\nElectrolyte\nLower limit\nUpper limit\nRelevant pages\nNa\n+\n<120mmol/L\n>155mmol/L\np672\nK\n+\n<2.5mmol/L\n>6.5mmol/L\np674, p301\nCorrected Ca\n2+\n<2.0mmol/L\n>3.5mmol/L\np676, p678\nGlucose\n<2.0mmol/L\n>20mmol/L\np832, p834\nBlood gases:\n  \n\u2022 PaO2 <8.0kPa = Severe hypoxia.
