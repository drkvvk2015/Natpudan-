But despite this, the sight \nof a diabetic patient minus one limb is not rare, and must prompt us to redouble \nour commitment to primary prevention, ie stopping those at risk from ever getting \ndiabetes. The sequelae of diabetic neuropathy can lead to gangrene, amputation, \nand the impact on quality of life can be profound. As one patient post amputation \nsaid, \u2018I begin again to walk, on crutches. What nuisance, what fatigue, what sad-\nness, when I think about all my ancient travels, and how active I was just 5 months \nago! Where are the runnings across mountains, the walks, the deserts, the rivers, \nand the seas? And now, the life of a legless cripple. For I begin to understand that \ncrutches, wooden and articulated legs, are a pack of jokes\u2026Goodbye to family, \ngoodbye to future!

Avoid stopping insulin in periods of acute illness.\nSpecial situations in diabetes", "text_length": 3057, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 221/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 220, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.353853", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.360709", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
