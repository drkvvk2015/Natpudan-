Most common in mid\nAtlantic states. Rash begins on extremities and\nmoves centrally. Treat with doxycycline\n\u0002\nMURINE TYPHUS\nflea vector. Rash begins centrally\nand moves peripherally. Treat with doxycycline or\nchloramphenicol\n\u0002\nEHRLICHIA\nE. chaffeensis (human monocytic ehrli\nchiosis) transmitted by lone star tick. Peaks in May\nto July. Infects lymphocytes, monocytes, and neu\ntrophils intracellularly. Fever, headache, myalgia,\nleukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated trans\naminases; maculopapular or petechial rash in one\nthird. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is caused by\na related Ehrlichia and produces similar illness with\nout rash. Transmitted by Ixodes tick and co infection\nwith Lyme disease possible. Treat with doxycycline\n\u0002 Q FEVER\nCoxiella burnetii transmitted by respira\ntory spread from infected animal body fluids (e.g.\ncattle, sheep, goats, cats). No rash.

Laboratory testing has limited\nutility. In endemic areas, the combination of history\nof a tick bite, a solitary lesion of appropriate size,\nmorphology and presence of systemic symptoms is\nconsistent with erythema migrans. In non endemic\nareas, these same factors are also suggestive of this\ndiagnosis and should prompt further investigation\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2007 297:23\nFever and Rash\n235", "text_length": 4294, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 245/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 244, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.584416", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.585182", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
