In the 1880s, over 12 000 \ndoctors were queuing up to use his special extracts on patients, which he gave \naway free, provided results were reported back to him. 314 out of 405 cases of spi-\nnal syphilis improved, and his own urinary \ufb02 ow rate rose by 25%. Endocrin ologists \nnever forgave him for bringing their science into disrepute. To this day, no one \nreally knows if his (literally) seminal work has given us anything of any practical \nvalue. But he might be pleased to know that testosterone is now known to have \nthe urodynamic bene\ufb01 ts he anticipated, at least in men with hypogonadism.23\nLike many brilliant men, he had a cruel streak, backing clitoridectomy for preven-\nt ing blindness and other imaginary complic ations of \u2018masturbatory melan cholia\u2019. \nHad he not been blinded by 19th-century ideas about female sexuality, could he \nhave found a marvellous use for his concoctions, for 21st-century \u2018hypo active \nsexual desire disorder\u2019? Possibly, but only if he relied on placebo responses.24,25\nFame and infamy in the search for lost youth\n1 Der Vogel k\u00e4mpft sich aus dem Ei. Das Ei ist die Welt.

He had to be wheeled \nto the operating theatre to carry on his brilliant art (and to continue terrifying his \nassistants).26 He had to retire partially, whereupon his colleagues presented him \nwith a magni\ufb01 cent silver cigarette box, containing 2000 cigarettes (to which he \nwas addicted)\u2014one for each brain tumour he had removed during his long career, \nso verifying the truth that although we owe everything to our teachers, we must \neventually kill them to move out from under their shadow.\n1\nPoisoning your boss\n  \n\u2022 An earlier age at presentation (median 29yrs vs 60yrs in sporadic CJD).\n  \n\u2022 Longer survival and later dementia (median 14 months vs 4 for sporadic CJD).\n  \n\u2022 Psychiatric features are an early sign (anxiety, withdrawal, apathy, agitation, a \npermanent look of fear in the eyes, depression, personality change, insomnia). \nHallucinations and delusions may occur\u2014before akinetic mutism.\n  \n\u2022 Painful sensory symptoms are commoner (eg foot pain hyperaesthesia).\n  \n\u2022 More normal EEG (sporadic CJD has a characteristic spike and wave pattern).\n  \n\u2022 Mean CSF tau-pT181/tau protein ratio is 10-fold higher in VCJD than in SCJD.22\n  \n\u2022 Homozygosity for methionine at codon 129 of the PRP gene is typical.\nSigns that may distinguish variant CJD from sporadic CJD (SCJD)\nFor centuries, kuru was no bigger than a man\u2019s hand; a cloud barely visible on \nour horizon; a rare disease in cannibals beyond the Paci\ufb01 c. But meticulous work \non kuru led to knowledge of prion diseases before the 1990s epidemic of VCJD. If \nin the 1950s, Gajdusek and Zigas had not been intrigued as to why kuru aff ected \nwomen and children more than men (their strange neural diet was the culprit), the \ndiscovery of vCJD would have been delayed, as no surveillance would have been in \nplace. Neural tissue might still be in our food chain, with dreadful consequences. \nBut further than this, the notion of \u2018protein-misfolding diseases\u2019\n2 would have been \ndelayed by decades.
