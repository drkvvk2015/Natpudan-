Giant cell arteritis: severe temporal headache, jaw claudication, scalp ten-\nderness, \ue000ESR: \ue007 urgent steroids (p556). Optic neuritis: eg in MS.\n  \n\u2022 Is the cornea cloudy: corneal ulcer (OHCS p435), glaucoma (OHCS p433)?\n  \n\u2022 Is there a contact lens problem (infection)?\n  \n\u2022 Any \ufb02 ashes/\ufb02 oaters? (TIA, migraine, retinal detachment?)\n  \n\u2022 Is there a visual \ufb01 eld problem (stroke, space-occupying lesion, glaucoma)?\n  \n\u2022 Are there any focal CNS signs?\n  \n\u2022 Any valvular heart disease/carotid bruits (emboli)? Hyperlipidaemia (p690)?\n  \n\u2022 Is there a relative aff erent pupillary defect (p72)?\n  \n\u2022 Any past history of trauma, migraine, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, MS, \ndiabetes or connective tissue disease?\n  \n\u2022 Any distant signs: eg HIV (causes retinitis), SLE, sarcoidosis?\nSudden: \u2022 Acute glaucoma \u2022 Retinal detachment \u2022 Vitreous haemorrhage (eg \nin diabetic proliferative retinopathy) \u2022 Central retinal artery or vein occlusion \n\u2022 Migraine \u2022 CNS: TIA (amaurosis fugax), stroke, space-occupying lesion \u2022 Optic neu-\nritis (eg MS) \u2022 Temporal arteritis \u2022 Drugs: quinine/methanol \u2022 Pituitary apoplexy.\nGradual: \u2022 Optic atrophy \u2022 Chronic glaucoma \u2022 Cataracts \u2022 Macular degeneration \n\u2022 Tobacco amblyopia.\nVisual loss\nDrooping of the upper eyelid. Best observed with patient sitting up, with head held \nby examiner. Oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates main muscle concerned (levator \npalpebrae), but nerves from the cervical sympathetic chain innervate superior tar-\nsal muscle, and a lesion of these nerves causes mild ptosis which can be overcome \non looking up. Causes:\n1   CN III lesions cause unilateral complete ptosis: look for other evidence of a \nCN III lesion: ophth almoplegia with \u2018down and out\u2019 deviation of the eye, pupil \ndil ated and unreactive to light or accommodation. If eye pain too, suspect \nin\ufb01 ltration (eg by lymphoma or sarcoidosis). If \ue000 T\u00b0 or \ue001consciousness, suspect \ninfection (any tick bites?).\n2   Sympathetic paralysis usually causes unilateral partial ptosis. Look for other \nevidence of a sympathetic lesion, as in Horner\u2019s syndrome (p702): constricted \npupil = miosis, lack of sweating on same side of the face (=anhidrosis).\n3   Myopathy, eg dystrophia myotonica, myasthenia gravis (cause bilateral partial \nptosis).\n4   Congenital; usually partial and without other CNS signs.\nPtosis\nFig 2.34  Internuclear ophthal-\nmoplegia (INO) and its causes. To \nproduce synchronous eye move-\nments, cranial nerves III, IV, and \nVI communicate through medial \nlong it udinal fasciculus in midbrain. \nIn INO, a lesion disrupts commu n-\ni cation, causing weakness in ad-\nduction of the ipsilat eral eye with \nnystagmus of the contralateral eye \nonly when abducting. There may be \nincomplete or slow abduction of the \nipsilateral eye during lateral gaze. \nConvergence is preserved. Causes \nMS or vascular (rarely: HIV; syphilis; \nLyme disease; brainstem tumours; \nphenothiazine toxicity).", "text_length": 3125, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 85/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 84, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.008552", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.009563", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
