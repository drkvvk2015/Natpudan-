There is con-\nsiderable inter-individual susceptibility.\n\ue007Don\u2019t wait for a lab result: use the blood gas analyser.\n\ue022Treat5 K\n+ >6.5mmol/L or any with ECG changes (ECG for all K\n+ >6.0mmol/L):\n1   10mL of 10% calcium chloride\n2 (or 30mL of 10% calcium gluconate) IV via a \nbig vein over 5\u201310min, repeated if necessary and if ECG changes persist. This is \ncardioprotective (for 30\u201360min) but does not treat K\n+ level.\n2   Intravenous insulin (10u soluble insulin) in 25g glucose (50mL of 50% or 125mL \nof 20% glucose). Insulin stimulates intracellular uptake of K\n+, lowering serum \nK\n+ by 0.65\u20131.0mmol/L over 30\u201360min. Monitor hourly for hypoglycaemia (in \n11\u201375% of treated patients) which may be delayed in renal impairment (up to \n6 hours after infusion).\n3   Salbutamol also causes an intracellular K\n+ shift but high doses are required \n(10\u201320mg via nebulizer) and tachycardia can limit use (10mg dose in IHD, avoid \nin tachyarrhythmias).\n4   De\ufb01 nitive treatment requires K\n+ removal. If the underlying pathology cannot \nbe corrected renal replacement may be indicated. Safe transfer to an off site \nrenal unit requires K\n+ <6.5mmol/L\u2014discuss with renal team and critical care.\nUse of intravenous sodium bicarbonate is controversial with insuffi  cient evidence \nthat it has any additional bene\ufb01 t over the treatment steps listed here. There is a \nrisk of both sodium and \ufb02 uid overload. Bolus doses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate \nshould not be used.\nHyperkalaemia\nRRT options in AKI include haemodialysis and haemo\ufb01 ltration (p306). Peritoneal \ndialysis is rare for AKI in adults and in high-income countries but can be used.\nPossible indications for renal replacement therapy:\n  \n\u2022 Fluid overload unresponsive to medical treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Severe/prolonged acidosis.\n  \n\u2022 Recurrent/persistent hyperkalaemia despite medical treatment.\n  \n\u2022 Uraemia eg pericarditis, encephalopathy (more common in CKD).\nThe decision to start RRT should be individualized, aiming to provide organ support \nand prevent complications, rather than waiting for them to occur. The complexity \nof AKI and variation in thresholds for starting RRT prevent robust meta-analysis. \nFluid overload is likely to be an important predictor of worse outcome.\nPossible complications of RRT: Risks of dialysis catheter insertion and mainte-\nnance, procedural hypotension, bleeding due to the requirement for anticoagula-\ntion, altered nutrition and drug clearance.\nRenal replacement therapy (RRT) in AKI\n2 Calcium chloride contains 3x calcium than the same volume of gluconate. Concern exists about the \n\ue001bioavailability of calcium gluconate.
