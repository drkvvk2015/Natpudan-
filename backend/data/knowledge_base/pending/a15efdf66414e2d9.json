It is most commonly seen in people \nof African origin, and arises from an amino acid substitution in the gene coding for \nthe \ue020 chain (Glu \ue003 Val at position 6) which leads to production of HbS rather than \nHbA (HbA2 and HbF are still produced). Homozygotes (SS) have sickle-cell anaemia \n(HbSS), and hetero zygotes (HbAS) have sickle-cell trait, which causes no disability \n(and protects from falciparum malaria). Heterozygotes may still, however, experi-\nence symptomatic sickling in hypoxia, eg in unpressurized aircraft or anaesthesia (so \nall those of African descent need a pre-op sickle-cell test).\nPathogenesis HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing RBCS to deform, pro-\nducing sickle cells, which are fragile and haemolyse, and also block small vessels.\nPrevalence 1:700 people of African descent.\nTests Haemolysis is variable. Hb \u2248 60\u201390g/L, \ue000reticulocytes 10\u201320%, \ue000bilirubin. \nFilm: sickle cells and target cells (\ufb01 g 8.37). Sickle solubility test: +ve, but does not \ndistinguish between HbSS and HbAS. Hb electrophoresis: Con\ufb01 rms the diagnosis \nand distinguishes SS, AS states, and other Hb variants. \ue007Aim for diagnosis at birth \n(cord blood) to aid prompt pneumococcal prophylaxis (vaccine, p167 \u00b1 penicillin V).\nSigns/symptoms Chronic haemolysis is usually well tolerated (except in crises; see \nBOX \u2018Managing sickle-cell crises\u2019).\nVaso-occlusive \u2018painful\u2019 crisis: Common, due to microvascular occlusion. Often af-\nfects the marrow, causing severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or \nhypoxia. Hands and feet are aff ected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may \ncause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen. CNS infarction occurs \nin ~10% of children, leading to stroke, seizures, or cognitive defects. Trans cranial \nDoppler ultrasonography indicates risk of impending stroke, and blood transfusions \ncan prevent this by reducing HbS. Also avascular necrosis (eg of femoral head), leg \nulcers (\ufb01 g 8.38) and low-\ufb02 ow priapism (also seen in CML, may respond to hydration, \n\ue025-agonists, eg phenylephrine, or aspiration of blood + irrigation with saline; if for \n>12h prompt cavernosus\u2013spongiosum shunting can prevent later impotence). \nAplastic crisis: This is due to parvovirus B19, with sudden reduction in marrow \nproduction, especially RBCs. Usually self-limiting <2wks; transfusion may be needed.\nSequestration crisis: Mainly aff ects children as in adults the spleen becomes \natrophic. There is pooling of blood in the spleen \u00b1 liver, with organomegaly, severe \nanaemia, and shock. Urgent transfusion is needed.\nComplications \u2022 Splenic infarction occurs before 2yrs old, due to micro-\nvascular occlusion, leading to \ue000susceptibility to infection (40% of childhood \nsickle deaths are caused this way). \u2022 Poor growth. \u2022 Chronic renal failure. \u2022 Gall-\nstones. \u2022 Retinal disease. \u2022 Iron overload (see BOX \u2018A 7-year-old ...\u2019). \u2022Lung damage: \nhypoxia\ue003\ufb01 brosis\ue003pulmonary hypertension.\nManagement of chronic disease \ue007Get help from a haematologist.\n  \u2022 Hydroxycarbamide if frequent crises (\ue000production of fetal haemoglobin, HbF). Dose \nexample: 20mg/kg/d if eGFR >60mL/min.\n  \n\u2022 Splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism and immunocompromise. Prophylaxis, in \nterms of antibiotics and immunization, should be given (p373).\n  \n\u2022 Febrile children risk septicaemia: repeated admission may be avoided by early \nrescue out-patient antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (eg 2 doses, 50mg/kg IV on day 0 \nand 1). Consider admission if Hb <50g/L, WCC <5 or >30 \u2248 10\n9/L, T\u00b0 >40\u00b0C, severe \npain, dehydration, lung in\ufb01 ltration. Seek expert advice.\n  \n\u2022 Bone marrow transplant can be curative but remains controversial.\nPrevention Genetic counselling; prenatal tests (OHCS pp154\u20135). Parental education \ncan help prevent 90% of deaths from sequestration crises.", "text_length": 4029, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 348/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 347, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.761977", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.762825", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
