It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Usually patients have \neither COPD or asthma, not both: COPD is favoured by: \u2022age of onset >35yrs \u2022smok-\ning (passive or active) or pollution related38 \u2022chronic dyspnoea \u2022sputum production \n\u2022minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variat ion. Chronic bronchitis is de\ufb01 ned clini-\ncally as cough, sputum production on most days for 3 months of 2 successive yrs. \nSymptoms improve if they stop smoking. There is no excess mortality if lung func-\ntion is normal. Emphysema is de\ufb01 ned histologically as enlarged air spaces distal to \nterminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT.\nPrevalence 10\u201320% of the over-40s; 2.5\u224810\n6 deaths/yr worldwide. 39\nPink puff ers and blue bloaters A traditional division but likely ends of a spec-\ntrum. Pink puffers: Have \ue000alveolar ventilation, a near normal PaO2 and a normal or \nlow PaCO2. They are breathless but are not cyanosed. They may progress to type I \nrespiratory failure (p188). Blue bloaters: Have \ue001alveolar ventilation, with a low PaO2 \nand a high PaCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on to develop \ncor pulmonale. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO2 and they \nrely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory eff ort (p188)\u2014\ue007supplemental oxygen \nshould be given with care.\nSymptoms Cough; sputum; dyspnoea; wheeze. Signs Tachypnoea; use of accessory \nmuscles of respiration; hyperin\ufb02 ation; \ue001cricosternal distance (<3cm); \ue001expansion; \nresonant or hyperresonant percussion note; quiet breath sounds (eg over bullae); \nwheeze; cyanosis; cor pulmonale.\nComplications Acute exacerbations \u00b1 infection; polycythaemia; respiratory failure; \ncor pulmonale (oedema; \ue000JVP); pneumothorax (ruptured bullae); lung carcinoma.\nTests FBC: \ue000PCV. CXR: Hyperin\ufb02 ation; \ufb02 at hemidiaphragms; large central pulmonary \narteries; \ue001peripheral vascular markings; bullae. CT: Bronchial wall thickening; scar-\nring; air space enlargement. ECG: Right atrial and ventricular hyper trophy (cor \npulmonale). ABG: \ue001PaO2 \u00b1 hypercapnia. Spirometry (p162, p165): obstructive + air \ntrapping (FEV1 <80% of predicted, FEV1 : FVC ratio <70%, \ue000TLC, \ue000RV, \ue001DLCO in emphy-\nsema\u2014see p160). Learn how to do spirometry from an experienced person: ensure \nmaximal expiration of the full breath (it takes >4s; it\u2019s not a quick puff  out).\nTreatment Chronic stable: see BOX and \ufb01 g 4.14; \ue022Emergency \ue057: p812. Smoking ces-\nsation advice with cordial vigour (p93). Encourage exercise: BMI is often low; diet \nadvice \u00b1 supplements 40 may help (p584). Mucolytics (BNF 3.7) may help chronic pro-\nductive cough (NICE). 41 Disabilities may cause serious, treatable depression; screen \nfor this (p15). Respiratory failure: p188. Oedema: diuretics. Flu and pneumococcal \nvaccinations: p167 and p396.\nLong-term O2 therapy (LTOT): An MRC trial showed that if PaO2 was maintained \n\u22658.0kPa for 15h a day, 3yr survival improved by 50%. UK NICE guidelines suggest \nLTOT should be given for: 1 Clinically stable non-smokers with PaO2 <7.3kPa\u2014despite \nmaximal \ue057. These values should be stable on two occasions >3wks apart. 2 If PaO2 \n7.3\u20138.0 and pulmonary hypertension (eg RVH; loud S2), or polycythaemia, or peripheral \noedema, or nocturnal hypoxia. 3 O2 can also be prescribed for terminally ill patients.\nSeverity assessment has implications for therapy and prognosis. The BODE index \n(Body mass index, air\ufb02 ow Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity) helps \npredict outcome and number and severity of exacerbations. The Global Initia-\ntive for COPD (GOLD) categorizes severity of COPD into four stages (mild, moderate, \nsevere, and very severe) based on post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted, but it is \nnot useful for predicting total mortality for 3 years of follow-up and onwards.42\nSeverity assessment in COPD", "text_length": 4131, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 192/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 191, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.263106", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.263781", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
