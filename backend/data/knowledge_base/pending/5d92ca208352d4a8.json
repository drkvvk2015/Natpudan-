The\nfeatures evaluated in more than one study with the lowest LRs (<0.60) for diagnosing of heart failure were\nthe following: the overall clinical judgment, no prior history of heart failure, no dyspnea on exertion, the\nabsence of rales, and the absence of radiographic pulmonary venous congestion, or cardiomegaly. The single\nfinding that decreased the likelihood of heart failure the most was a BNP <100 pg/mL. While the findings of\nthis study are useful when assessing dyspneic patients suspected of having heart failure, no individual feature\nis sufficiently powerful in isolation to rule heart failure in or out. Therefore, an overall clinical impression based\non all available information is best. If the appropriate constellation of findings with high LRs for heart failure\nare present, that may be sufficient to warrant empirical treatment without further urgent investigations\u2019\u2019\nJAMA 2005 294:15\nRATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION SERIES:\nDOES THIS PATIENT HAVE ABNORMAL\nCENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE?\nJVP VS. CAROTID\nJVP has biphasic waveforms,\nis non palpable, is occludable, decreases with\ninspiration, changes with position, and increases\nwith abdominojugular reflux (AJR).

Somewhat helpful\nfindings are dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia,\ndecreased systolic or pulse pressure, S3, rales, and\nabdominojugular reflux. Edema is helpful only\nwhen present\nSYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION\nvery helpful findings\nare radiograph (cardiomegaly, redistribution),\nanterior Q waves, LBBB, and abnormal apical\nimpulse (especially if sustained). Somewhat help\nful findings are tachycardia, decreased blood pres\nsure or pulse pressure, S3, rales, dyspnea, previous\ninfarction other than anterior, and high peak CK\n(post infarct).
