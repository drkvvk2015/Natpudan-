Risk factors: Anorec eptive \nintercourse; HPV (HPV 16 associated with worse prognosis); HIV. Histology: Squamous \ncell (85%); rarely basaloid, melanoma, or adenocarcinoma. Anal margin tumours \nare usually well-diff erentiated, keratinizing lesions with a good prognosis. Anal ca-\nnal tumours arise above dentate line, are poorly diff erentiated and non-keratinizing \nwith a poorer prognosis. Spread: Tumours above the dentate line spread to pelvic \nlymph nodes; those below spread to the inguinal nodes. Presentation: Bleeding, \npain, bowel habit change, pruritus ani, masses, stricture. \ue059\ue059: Perianal warts; leu-\ncoplakia; lichen sclerosis; Bowen\u2019s disease; Crohn\u2019s disease. Treatment: Chemo-\nirradiation (radiotherapy + \ufb02 uorouracil + mitomycin/cisplatin) is usually prefer red \nto ano rectal excision & colostomy; 75% retain normal anal function.\nAnal cancer\nFig 13.43 Anatomy of the anal canal.
