Dietician referral may be useful. Aggressive\nmeasures such as parenteral or enteral feeding have\nlimited impact on survival but may significantly\ndecrease the quality of life. Their use should be\nlimited to patients for whom starvation is a major\ncomponent of weight loss (e.g. dysphagia from\nesophageal or head and neck cancer, bowel obstruc\ntion from peritoneal carcinomatosis)\nOREXIGENIC AGENTS (appetite stimulants)\ncorti\ncosteroids (dexamethasone 4 mg PO daily, patients\nmay experience an increase in appetite and sense of\nMANAGEMENT (CONT\u2019D)\nwell being.

CORTICOSTEROIDS\nmegestrol has been shown to increase appetite and\nweight (but not lean body mass) and may be con\nsidered for intermediate term use if weight loss is\nthe predominant symptom. However, its significant\nside effect profile should be taken into consideration.\nCorticosteroids may be useful for short term (i.e. days\nto weeks) use, particularly if other symptoms (e.g.\npain, nausea) are present. Long term use of steroid\nshould be avoided due to side effects. Investigational\nagents include melatonin 6 20 mg PO daily which\nhas been shown to be effective in preventing and\ntreating cancer cachexia in open labeled trials\nRelated Topics\nNausea and Vomiting (p. 111)\nSupplemental Nutrition (p. 406)\n398\nAnorexia\u2013Cachexia", "text_length": 3690, "metadata": {"source": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf (Part 404/464)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 403, "total_chunks": 464, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.804983", "document_uuid": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94", "filename": "Approach to Internal Medicine_ A Resource Book for Clinical Practice ( PDFDrive ).pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": null, "outdated": false, "document_id": "fda2cab4-cdd9-4015-af24-46fd62c86d94"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:40:09.805703", "status": "pending"}
