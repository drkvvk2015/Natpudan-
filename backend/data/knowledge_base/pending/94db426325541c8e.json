Helminths: paragon-\nimiasis; hydatid (p435); schistosomiasis.\n2 Neoplastic\nPrimary or secondary.\n3 Vascular\nLung infarction (PE); vasculitis (ANCA-associated; RA; SLE); \nhereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; AV malforma-\ntion; capillaritis.\n4 Parenchymal\nDiff use interstitial \ufb01 brosis; sarcoidosis; haemosid erosis; \nGoodpasture\u2019s syndrome; cystic \ufb01 brosis.\n5 Pulmonary \nhypertension\nIdiopathic, thromboembolic, congenital cyanotic heart \ndisease (p156), pulmonary \ufb01 brosis, bronchiectasis.\n6 Coagulopathies\nAny\u2014eg thrombocytopenia, p344; DIC; warfarin excess.\n7 Trauma/foreign body\nEg post-intubation, or an eroding implanted de\ufb01 brillator.\n8 Pseudo-haemoptysis\nMunchausen\u2019s (p706); aspirated haematemesis; red pig ment \n(prodigiosin) from Serratia marcescens (Gram-negative \nbacteria) in sputum.7\nRare causes refuse to be classi\ufb01 ed neatly: vascular causes may have infective origins, \neg hydatid cyst may count as a foreign body, and infection, and vascular if it \ufb01 stulates \nwith the aorta; ditto for infected (mycotic) aneurysm rupture, or TB aortitis. Infective \ncauses entailing coag ulopathy: dengue; leptospirosis. In monthly haemoptysis, think \nof lung endometriosis.\n\ue057: Haemoptysis may need treating in its own right, if mass ive (eg trauma, TB, \nhydatid cyst, cancer, AV malformation): call chest team, consider interventional \nradiology input (danger is drowning: lobe resection, endobronchial tamponade, or \narterial embolization may be needed). Set up IVI, do CXR, blood gases, FBC, INR/APTT, \ncrossmatch. If distressing, give prompt IV morphine, eg if inoperable malignancy.\nDyspnoea\nSubjective sensation of shortness of breath, often exacerbated by exertion.\n  \n\u2022 Lung\u2014airway and interstitial disease. May be hard to separate from cardiac \ncauses; asthma may wake patient, and cause early morning dyspnoea & wheeze.\n  \n\u2022 Cardiac\u2014eg ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular failure (LVF), mitral ste-\nnosis, of any cause. LVF is associated with orthopnoea (dyspnoea worse on lying; \n\u2018How many pillows?\u2019) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND; dyspnoea waking \none up). Other features include ankle oedema, lung crepitations, and \ue000JVP.\n  \n\u2022 Anatomical\u2014eg diseases of the chest wall, muscles, pleura. Ascites can cause \nbreathlessness by splinting the diaphragm, restricting its movement.\n  \n\u2022 Others \ue007Any shocked patient may also be dyspnoeic (p790 & p607)\u2014dyspnoea \nmay be shock\u2019s presenting feature. Also anaemia or metabolic acidosis caus-\ning respiratory compensation, eg ketoacidosis, aspirin poisoning. Look for other \nclues\u2014dyspnoea at rest unassociated with exertion, may be psychogenic: pro-\nlonged hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis. This causes a fall in ion ized \ncalcium leading to apparent hypocalcaemia. Features include peripheral and \nperioral paraesthesiae \u00b1 carpopedal spasm.
