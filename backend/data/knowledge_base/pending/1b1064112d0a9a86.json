Causes: Bullet, stab, tumour, disc hernia, my-\nelitis,12 septic emboli. Imaging: MRI. \nCharles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard, 1817\u20131894 (Mauritian neurologist)\nBudd\u2013Chiari syndrome Hepatic vein obstruction by thrombosis or tumour causes \ncongestive ischaemia and hepatocyte damage. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, as-\ncites, and \ue000ALT occur. Portal hypert ension occurs in chronic forms. Causes: Include \nhypercoag ulable states (combined OCP, pregnancy, malignancy, paroxysmal noc-\nturnal haemoglobin uria, polycythaemia, thrombophilia), TB, liver, renal, or adrenal \ntumour. Tests: USS + Dopplers, CT, or MRI. Angioplasty or a transjugular intrahepatic \nporto systemic shunt (TIPSS) may be needed. Anticoagulate (lifelong) unless there are \nvarices. Consider liver transplant in fulminant hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis.13  \n \nGeorge Budd, 1808\u20131882 (British physician); Hans Chiari, 1851\u20131916 (Austrian pathologist)\nBuerger\u2019s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans.) Non-atherosclerotic smoking-\nrelated in\ufb02 ammation and thrombosis of veins and middle-sized arteries causing \nthrombophlebitis and ischaemia (\ue003ulcers, gangrene). Cause: Unknown. Stopping \nsmoking is vital. Most patients are men aged 20\u201345yrs (see BOX \u2018Poisoning your \nboss\u2019).  \nLeo Buerger, 1879\u20131943 (US physician)\nCaplan\u2019s syndrome Multiple lung nodules in coal workers with RA, caused by an in-\n\ufb02 ammatory reaction to anthracite (also associated with silica or asbestos exposure). \nCXR: bilateral peri pheral nodules (0.5\u20135cm). \ue031\ue031 : TB. \nAnthony Caplan, 1907\u20131976 (British physician)\nCharcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth syndrome (Peroneal muscular atrophy.) This inherited \nneuropathy starts in puberty with weak legs and foot drop + variable loss of sensa-\ntion and re\ufb02 exes. The peroneal muscles atrophy, leading to an inverted champagne \nbottle appearance. Atrophy of hand and arm muscles also occurs. The most common \nform, CMT1A (PMP22 myelin gene mutation on chr. 17), has AD inheritance. Quality of life \nis good; total incapacity rare. Hand pain/paraesthesiae may respond to nerve release. \n Jean-Marie Charcot, 1825\u20131893; Pierre Marie, 1853\u20131940 (French neurologists); Howard H Tooth, 1856\u20131926 (British physician)\nChurg\u2013Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.) A \ntriad of adult-onset asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis (\u00b1 vasospasm \u00b1 MI \u00b1 DVT), \naff ecting lungs, nerves, heart, and skin. A septic-shock picture/systemic in\ufb02 amma-\ntory response syndrome may occur (with glomerulo neph ritis/renal failure, esp. if \nANCA +ve). \ue057: Steroids; biological agents if refractory disease, eg rituximab.14  \n \n \nJacob Churg, 1910\u20132005; Lotte Strauss, 1913\u20131985 (US pathologists)\nCreutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) The cause is a prion (PrPSc), a misfolded form of a \nnormal protein (PrPc), that can transform other proteins into prion proteins (hence its \ninfectivity). \ue000PrPSc leads to spongiform changes (tiny cavities \u00b1 tubulovesicular struc-\ntures) in the brain.15 Most cases are sporadic (incidence: 1\u20133/million/yr). Variant CJD \n(vCJD; \u2248225 cases worldwide)16 is transmitted via con tamin ated CNS tissue aff ected by \nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (see BOX \u2018Signs that may distinguish variant \nCJD\u2019). Inherited forms: (eg Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker syndrome, P102L mutation \nin PRNP gene with ataxia \u00b1 self-mutilation), the \u2018normal\u2019 protein is too unstable, readily \ntrans forming to PrPSc. Iatrogenic causes: Cont aminated surgical instruments, corneal \ntransplants, growth hormone from human pituitaries, and blood (vCJD only).17 Prion \nprotein resists sterilization. Signs: Progressive dementia, focal CNS signs, myoclonus \n(present in 95%),18 depression, eye signs (diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual \ndisturbances, homonymous \ufb01 eld defects, hallucinations, cortical blind ness).19 Tests: \nTonsil/olfactory mucosa biopsy;20 CSF gel electrophoresis; MRI. Treatment: None proven. \nDeath occurs in ~6 months in sporadic CJD (a little slower in variant CJD). Prevention: \nRegulations to \ue001 spread of BSE and transmission to humans + \ue001 iatrogenic transmission.\n \nHans G Creutzfeldt, 1885\u20131964 (German pathologist); Alfons M Jakob 1884\u20131931 (German neurologist)\nCrigler\u2013Najjar syndrome Two rare syndromes of inherited unconjugated hyper-\nbilirubinaemia presenting in the 1st days of life with jaundice \u00b1 CNS signs.
