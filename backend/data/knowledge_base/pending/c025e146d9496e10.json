Rare in the under-40s. Incidence rises with \nage (3% over 55yrs old). Commoner in temperate climates, and in Anglo-Saxons.\nClinical features Asymptomatic in ~70%. Deep, boring pain, and bony deformity \nand enlargement\u2014typically of the pelvis, lumbar spine, skull, femur, and tibia (clas-\nsically a bowed sabre tibia; \ufb01 g 14.11). Complications include pathological fractures, \nosteo arthritis, \ue000Ca\n2+, nerve compression due to bone overgrowth (eg deafness, root \ncompression), high-output CCF (if >40% of skeleton involved), and osteosarcoma (<1% \nof those aff ected for >10yrs\u2014suspect if sudden onset or worsening of bone pain).19\nRadiology X-ray Localized enlargement of bone. Patchy cortical thickening with \nsclerosis, osteolysis, and deformity (eg osteoporosis circumscripta of the skull). Af-\n\ufb01 nity for axial skeleton, long bones, and skull. Bone scan may reveal \u2018hot spots\u2019.\nBlood chemistry Ca\n2+ and PO4\n3\u03a9 normal; ALP markedly raised.\nTreatment If analgesia fails, alendronic acid may be tried to reduce pain and/or \ndeformity. It is more eff ective than etidronate or calcitonin, and as eff ective as IV \npamidronate. Follow expert advice.\nFig 14.9 Osteomalacia.
