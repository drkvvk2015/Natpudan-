The choice of prosthesis is determined by \nthe anticipated longevity of the patient and the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate antico-\nagulation. Three mechanical valve designs exist: the caged ball valve, the tilting disc \n(single lea\ufb02 et) valve, and the bilea\ufb02 et valve. Tissue valves are made from porcine \nvalves or bovine pericardium.\nProsthetic aortic valves: All types produce a degree of out\ufb02 ow obstruction and \nthus have an ESM. The intensity of this murmur increases as the valve fails. Ball and \ncage valves (eg Starr\u2013Edwards) and tissue valves do close completely in diastole \nand so any diastolic murmur implies valve failure.\nProsthetic mitral valves: Ball and cage valves project into the left ventricle and \ncan cause a low-intensity ESM as they interfere with the ejected stream. Tissue \nvalves and bilea\ufb02 et valves can have a low-intensity diastolic murmur. Consider \nany systolic murmur of loud intensity to be a sign of regurgitation and \ue018 failure.\nProsthetic valve murmurs", "text_length": 2251, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 59/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 58, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.960893", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:51.962165", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
