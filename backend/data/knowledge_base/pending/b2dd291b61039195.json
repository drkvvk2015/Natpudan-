In the \nUK, the majority are performed as day-case procedures.\nIndications\n  \n\u2022 Coronary artery disease: diagnostic (assessment of coronary vessels and graft pa-\ntency); therapeutic (angioplasty, stent insertion), \ufb01 g 3.18b.\n  \n\u2022 Valvular disease: diagnostic (pressures indicate severity); therapeutic valvuloplas-\nty (if the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery).\n  \n\u2022 Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by meas-\nuring pressures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy).\n  \n\u2022 Other: cardiomyopathy; pericardial disease; endomyocardial biopsy.\nPre-procedure checks\n  \n\u2022 Brief history/examination; NB: peripheral pulses, bruits, aneurysms.\n  \n\u2022 Investigations: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting screen, CXR, ECG.\n  \n\u2022 Consent for procedure, including possible extra procedures, eg consent for angio-\nplasty if planning to do angiography as you may \ufb01 nd a lesion that needs stenting. \nExplain reason for procedure and possible complications.\n  \n\u2022 IV access, ideally in the left hand.\n  \n\u2022 Patient should be nil by mouth (NBM) from 6h before the procedure.\n  \n\u2022 Patients should take all their morning drugs (and pre-medication if needed)\u2014but \nwithhold oral hypoglycaemics.\nPost-procedure checks\n  \n\u2022 Pulse, BP, arterial puncture site (for bruising or swelling), foot pulses.\n  \n\u2022 Investigations: FBC and clotting (if suspected blood loss), ECG.\nComplications\n  \n\u2022 Haemorrhage: apply \ufb01 rm pressure over puncture site. If you suspect a false aneu-\nrysm, ultrasound the swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high \nrisk for infections.\n  \n\u2022 Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contrast agents.\n  \n\u2022 Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due to dissection, thrombosis, or arterial spasm. \nOccurs in <1% of brachial catheterizations. Rare with femoral catheterization.\n  \n\u2022 Angina: may occur during or after cardiac catheterization. Usually responds to \nsublingual GTN; if not, give analgesia and IV nitrates.\n  \n\u2022 Arrhythmias: usually transient. Manage along standard lines.\n  \n\u2022 Pericardial eff usion: suspect if unexplained continued chest pain. May need drain \ndepending on severity and haemodynamic status.\n  \n\u2022 Pericardial tamponade: rare, but should be suspected if the patient becomes hypo-\ntensive and anuric. \ue031\ue031 Urgent pericardial drain.\n  \n\u2022 Infection: post-catheter pyrexia is usually due to a contrast reaction. If it persists \nfor >24h, take blood cultures before giving antibiotics.\nMortality <1 in 1000 patients, in most centres.\nIntracardiac electrophysiology This catheter technique can determine types and \norigins of arrhythmias, and locate and ablate problem areas, eg aberrant pathways \nin WPW or arrhythmogenic foci. Arrhythmias may be induced, and the eff ectiveness \nof control by drugs assessed.", "text_length": 3643, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 120/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 119, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.063771", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.064557", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
