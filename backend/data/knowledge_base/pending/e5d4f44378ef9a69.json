It implies male pattern \nhair growth in women. Causes are familial, idiopathic, or are due to \ue000androgen secre-\ntion by the ovary (eg polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian cancer, OHCS p281), the \nadrenal gland (eg late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, OHCS p251, Cushing\u2019s \nsyndrome, adrenal cancer), or drugs (eg steroids). Polycystic ovarian syndrome \n(PCOS) causes secondary oligo - or amenorrhoea, infertility, obesity, acne, and hirsutism \n(OHCS p252). Ultrasound: bilateral polycystic ovaries. Blood tests: \ue000testosterone \n(if \u22656nmol/L, look for an androgen-producing adrenal or ovarian tumour), \ue001sex-\nhormone binding globulin, \ue000LH : FSH ratio (not consistent), TSH, lipids. Address any feel-\nings of lack of conformity to society\u2019s perceived norms of feminine beauty. \nManagement: Healthy eating, optimize weight, shaving; laser photoepilation; wax; \ncreams, eg e\ufb02 ornithine, or ele c trolysis (expensive/time-consuming, but eff ective); \nbleach (1 : 10 hydrogen peroxide).\n  \n\u2022 Oestrogens: combined contraceptive pill (OHCS p302)\u2014Yasmin\u00ae is one choice as its \nprogestogen, drospirenone, is an antimineralocorticoid. Alternatively, co-cyprindiol \nprovided there are no contraindications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and \ncurrent breast cancer. Stop co-cyprindiol 3\u20134 months after hirsutism has complete-\nly resolved because of increased VTE risk. If COCS are contraindicated or have not \nworked (after 6/12), refer the woman to secondary care for specialist treatment:\n  \n\u2022 Metformin (helps with insulin resistance) and spironolactone are sometimes tried.\n  \n\u2022 Clomifene is used for infertility (a fertility expert should prescribe).\nVirilism Onset of amenorrhoea, clitoromegaly, deep voice, temporal hair recession + \nhirsutism. Look for an androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumour.\nGynaecomastia (ie abnormal amount of breast tissue in men; may occur in normal \npuberty.) Oestro gen/androgen ratio\ue000 (vs galactorrhoea in which prolactin is \ue000). \nCauses: Hypogonadism (see BOX \u2018Male hypogonadism\u2019), liver cirrhosis (\ue000oestrogens), \nhyperthyroidism, tumours (oestrogen-producing, eg testicular, adrenal; HCG-producing, \neg testicular, bronchial); drugs: oestrogens, spirono lactone, digoxin, testosterone, \nmarijuana; if stopping is impossible, consider testosterone if hypogonadism \u00b1 anti-\noestrogen (tamoxifen). \nImpotence (= erectile dysfunction) Erections result from neuronal release of nitric \noxide (NO) which, via cGMP and Ca\n2+, hyperpolarizes and thus relaxes vascular and \ntrabecular smooth muscle cells, allowing engorgement. Common after 50yrs, and of-\nten multifactorial. A psychological facet is common (esp. if erectile dysfunction occurs \nonly in some situations, if onset coincides with stress, and if early morning erections \nstill occur: these also persist in early organic disease).\nOrganic causes: The big three: smoking, alcohol, and diabetes (reduce NO +autonomic \nneuropathy). Also endocrine: hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, \ue000prolactin; neurologi-\ncal: cord lesions, MS, autonomic neuropathy; pelvic surgery, eg bladder-neck, prostate; \nradiotherapy; atheroma; renal or hepatic failure; prostatic hyper plasia; penile \nanomalies, eg post-priapism, or Peyronie\u2019s (p708); drugs: digoxin, \ue020-blockers, diuretics, \nantipsychotics, antidepressants, oestrogens, \ufb01 nasteride, narcotics.\nWorkup: After a full sexual and psychological history do: U&E, LFT, glucose, TFT, LH, FSH, \nlipids, testosterone, prolactin \u00b1 Doppler.
