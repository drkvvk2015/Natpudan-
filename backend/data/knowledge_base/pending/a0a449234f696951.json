For example:\n  \n\u2022 Bleeding in pregnancy or the puerperium.\n  \n\u2022 GI bleeding in a jaundiced patient (ie coagulation factors already depleted).\n  \n\u2022 Bleeding in someone who is already anaemic (esp if other comorbidities).\n2   Why is the patient bleeding? Is bleeding normal, given the circumstances (eg \nsurgery, trauma, parturition), or does the patient have a bleeding disorder (BOX \n\u2018Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding?\u2019)?\n  \n\u2022 Is there a secondary cause, eg drugs (warfarin), alcohol, liver disease, sepsis?\n  \n\u2022 Is there unexplained bleeding, bruising, or purpura?\n  \n\u2022 Past or family history of excess bleeding, eg during trauma, dentistry, surgery?\n  \n\u2022 Is the pattern of bleeding indicative of vascular, platelet, or coagulation prob-\nlems (p344)? Are old venepuncture or cannula sites bleeding (DIC, p352)? Look \nfor associated conditions (eg with DIC).\n  \n\u2022 Is a clotting screen abnormal (table 8.3)? Check FBC, platelets, PT, APTT, and \nthrombin time. Consider D-dimers, bleeding time, and a factor VIII assay. \ue007If \nboth PT and APTT are very raised, with low platelets and \ue000D-dimers, consider \nDIC (p352).\n3   In cases of bleeding disorders, what is the mechanism? Investigate with \nFBC, \ufb01 lm, and coagulation screen (citrate tube; false results if under-\ufb01 lled):\n  \n\u2022 Prothrombin time (PT): Thromboplastin is added to test the extrinsic system. \nPT is expressed as a ratio compared to control (international normalized ratio \n(INR), normal range = 0.9\u20131.2). It tests for abnormalities in factors I, II, V, VII, X. \nProlonged by: warfarin, vitamin K de\ufb01 ciency, liver disease, DIC.\n  \n\u2022 Activated partial thrombo plastin time (APTT): Kaolin is added to test the \nintrinsic system. Tests for abnormalities in factor I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Normal \nrange 35\u201345s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, haemophilia, DIC, liver disease.\n  \n\u2022 Thrombin time: Thrombin is added to plasma to convert \ufb01 brinogen to \ufb01 brin. \nNormal range: 10\u201315s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, DIC, dys\ufb01 brinogenaemia.\n  \n\u2022 D-dimers are a \ufb01 brin degradation product, released from cross-linked \ufb01 b rin \nduring \ufb01 brinolysis (p345). This occurs during DIC, or in the presence of venous \nthromboembolism\u2014deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). \nD-dimers may also be raised in in\ufb02 ammation, eg with infection or malignancy.\nManagement Depends on the degree of bleeding. If shocked, resuscitate (p790). If \nbleeding continues in the presence of a clotting disorder or a massive transfusion, \ndiscuss the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates, or platelets with a \nhaematologist. In ITP (p345), steroids \u00b1 IV immunoglobulin may be used. Especially \nin pregnancy (OHCS p88), consult an expert. Is there overdose with anticoagulants \n(p842)? In haemophiliac bleeds, consult early for coagulation factor replacement. \nNever give IM injections.", "text_length": 3413, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 354/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 353, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.773885", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.774705", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
