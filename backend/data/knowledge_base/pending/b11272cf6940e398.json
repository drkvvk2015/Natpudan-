Stop \nobservations and blood tests (unless you are going to act on them). Rationalize medi-\ncations but keep any that provide ongoing symptom bene\ufb01 t.\nPrescribe as required subcutaneous end of life drugs. Prescribe PRN SC medica-\ntions before they are needed, in anticipation of symptoms (see table 11.6).\nStart a syringe driver when symptom control drugs are needed regularly\n(see table 11.7). Practice is variable, some drugs may be used outside of licensed \nindications. Always defer to local guidelines \ufb01 rst.
