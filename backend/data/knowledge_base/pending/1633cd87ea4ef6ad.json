Damage to one \nis usually associated with damage to the other = tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Can \nbe acute or chronic.\nAcute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN)\nPresents with AKI. Eosinophilia in ~30%. An \u2018allergic triad\u2019 of fever, rash, and arthral-\ngia occurs in ~10%. Should be considered in all cases of AKI for which there is no \nobvious pre-renal or post-renal precipitant (p298). Biopsy shows an in\ufb02 ammatory \ncell in\ufb01 ltrate in the interstitium \u00b1 tubule (\u2018tubulitis\u2019). Prognosis improves with early \nrecognition although residual CKD in up to 40%. Aetiology:\n  \n\u2022 Drugs: antibiotics, NSAIDS, PPIS, diuretics, ranitidine, anticonvulsants, warfarin.\n\ue007Take a full drug history including over-the-counter and herbal preparations.\n  \n\u2022 Infection: Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, E. \ncoli, Mycoplasma, CMV, EBV, HSV, hepatitis A-C.\n  \n\u2022 Autoimmune disease: SLE, sarcoid, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, ANCA.\nTreatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Steroids are used de-\nspite a paucity of RCT evidence.\nChronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN)\nInsidious onset and slowly progressive renal impairment. Biopsy shows interstitial \n\ufb01 brosis and tubular atrophy. Most commonly due to drugs (>70%) or infection. Pos-\nsible causes include:\n  \n\u2022 drugs: NSAIDs (p319), lithium, calcineurin inhibitors, aminosalicylates (eg mesala-\nzine, sulfasalazine), chemotherapy (eg cisplatin)\n  \n\u2022 infection: TB, pyelonephritis, leptospirosis, HIV\n  \n\u2022 immune disease: sarcoid, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\n  \n\u2022 speci\ufb01 c nephrotoxins: lead, cadmium, mercury, aristolochic acid (p319)\n  \n\u2022 haematological disorders: myeloma\n  \n\u2022 genetic interstitial disease.\nTreatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Reduce risk of progres-\nsion as per CKD management: ACE-i/ARB, BP control, glucose, lipids (pp304\u20135). Future: \nanti\ufb01 brotic agents?\nMany agents may be toxic to the kidneys either by direct damage to the tubules, or \nby causing an interstitial nephritis (see earlier in topic). Examples (not an exhaus-\ntive list and idiosyncratic reactions are possible):\nAnalgesics: NSAIDS (p319).\nAntimicrobials: Aminoglycosides (p319), sulfamethoxazole (in co-trimoxazole), \npenicillins, rifampicin, amphotericin, aciclovir.\nAnticonvulsants: Lamotrigine, valproate, phenytoin.\nOther drugs: PPIS, cimetidine, furosemide, thiazides, ACE-i /ARB, lithium, iron, cal-\ncineurin inhibitors, cisplatin.\nAnaesthetic agents: Methoxy\ufb02 urane, en\ufb02 urane.\nRadiocontrast material: (p319.)\nProteins: IgS in myeloma, light chain disease, Hb in haemolysis, myoglobin in rhab-\ndomyolysis (p319).\nCrystals: Urate (p319).\nBacteria: Streptococci, Legionella, Brucella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, TB, Sal-\nmonella, Campylobacter, leptospirosis, syphilis.\nViruses: EBV, CMV, HIV, polyomavirus, adenovirus, measles.\nParasites: Toxoplasma, Leishmania.\nOther: Ethylene glycol, radiation (p319), aristolochic acid (p319). \nNephrotoxins", "text_length": 3122, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 326/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 325, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.729200", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:52.729970", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
