Mobile images may be antero-posterior (AP, \ufb01 g 16.6), magnify-\ning heart size. If supine, distribution of air and \ufb02 uid in lungs and pleural cavities is \naltered and the diaphragm is elevated.\nAcclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memo-\nrably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and \u2018water\u2019/soft tissue. Each \nhas its own radiographic density. \ue007A border is only seen at an interface of two \ndensities, eg heart (soft tissue) and lung (air); this \u2018silhouette\u2019 is lost if air in the lung \nis replaced by consolidation (\u2018water\u2019). The silhouette sign localizes pathology (eg \nmiddle lobe pneumonia or collapse causing loss of clarity of the right heart border, \n\ufb01 g 16.2). When interpreting a CXR use a systematic approach that works for you, eg:\nTechnical quality\n  \n\u2022 Rotation: The sternal ends of the clavicles should symmetrically overlie the trans-\nverse processes of the 4th or 5th thoracic vertebrae. A rotated image can alter the \nposition of structures, eg rotation to the right projects the aortic arch vessels over \nthe right upper zone, appearing as though there is a mass.\n  \n\u2022 Inspiration: There should be 5 to 7 ribs visible anteriorly (or 10 posteriorly). Hy-\nperin\ufb02 ation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as \nthe heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding \nof vessels at the lung bases can mimic consolidation or collapse. This is common \nin patients who are acutely unwell, particularly those in pain or unconscious. Take \ncare in interpreting these images.\n  \n\u2022 Exposure: An under-exposed image will be too white and an over-exposed image \nwill be too black. Both cause a loss of de\ufb01 nition and quality although some com-\npensation can be made with standard viewing software.\n  \n\u2022 Position: The entire lung margin should be visible.\nTrachea Normally central or just to the right. Deviated by collapse (towards the le-\nsion), expansion (away from the lesion), or patient rotation.\nMediastinum May be: Widened by mediastinal fat; retrosternal thyroid; aortic \naneurysm/unfolding; lymph node enlargement (sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastases, \nTB); tumour (thymoma, teratoma); cysts (bronchogenic, pericardial); paravertebral \nmass (TB). Shifted towards a collapsed lung or away from processes that add vol-\nume (eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax).\nThere are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum \nthat help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to inferior they are: 1 Aortic \nknuckle. 2 Pulmonary out\ufb02 ow tract. 3 Left ventricle.\nHila The left hilum is higher than the right or at the same level (not lower); they \nshould be the same size and density. The hila may be: Pulled up or down by \ufb01 brosis \nor collapse. Enlarged by: pulmonary arterial hypertension; bronchogenic ca; lymph \nnodes. \ue007Sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma can give bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. \nCalci\ufb01 ed due to: sarcoid, past TB; silicosis; histoplasmosis (p408).\nHeart Normally less than half of the width of the thorax (cardiothoracic ratio <0.5). \u2153 \nshould lie to the right of the vertebral column, \u2154 to the left. It may appear elongated \nif the chest is hyperin\ufb02 ated (COPD); or enlarged if the image is AP or if there is LV \nfailure (\ufb01 g 16.3), or a pericardial eff usion. Are there calci\ufb01 ed valves?\nDiaphragm The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised \nhemidiaphragm: Trouble above the diaphragm\u2014lung volume loss or in\ufb02 ammation. \nTrouble with the diaphragm\u2014stroke; phrenic nerve palsy (causes, p504; any medias-\ntinal mass?). Trouble below the diaphragm\u2014hepatomegaly; subphrenic abscess. NB: \nsubpulmonic eff usion (eff usions having a similar contour to the diaphragm without \na characteristic meniscus) and diaphragm rupture give apparent elevation. NB: bilat-\neral palsies (polio, muscular dystrophy) cause hypoxia.", "text_length": 4120, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 730/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 729, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.428519", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.429792", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
