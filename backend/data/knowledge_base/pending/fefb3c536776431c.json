There are >150 000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year result-\ning in >44 000 deaths, and much morbidity.\nSepsis Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response \nto infection.\nSeptic shock Sepsis in combination with:\n  \n\u2022 EITHER lactate >2mmol/L despite adequate \ufb02 uid resuscitation\n  \n\u2022 OR the patient is requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP \u226565mmHg.\nAcute management in sepsis \ue007Early recognition and treatment is key. See \ufb01 g 19.3.2\nAntibiotics: These should be broad spectrum and start within 1h. Consider covering \nfor non-bacterial microbes, eg give aciclovir if HSV encephalitis is suspected.\nFluids: Give within 1h if high risk with SBP <90, AKI, or lactate >2 (consider if <2).\n  \n\u2022 Give 500mL boluses of crystalloids with 130\u2013154mmol/L sodium (eg 0.9% saline) \nover 15mins. Caution in heart failure.\n  \n\u2022 If no improvement after two boluses, speak with a senior.\nOxygen: Give oxygen as required for target saturations. These will be 94\u201398% (or \n88\u201392% if the patient is at risk of CO2 retention, eg in severe COPD).\nCritical care review: Speak with critical care early if intensive care support (eg \ninotropes, ventilation, haemo\ufb01 ltration, intensive monitoring) may be required.\nSurgical involvement: Eg emergency wound debridement.\nManage acute complications: Shock (p790), AKI (p298), DIC (p352), ARDS (p186), ar-\nrhythmias (may spontaneously resolve when sepsis improves).\nMany sepsis-related deaths could be prevented with earlier treatment. Often, the \nkey failure in sepsis management is not recognizing sepsis in time. Early warning \nscores (p892, \ufb01 g A1) help identify inpatients who are becoming septic.\nHave a low threshold for assessing for sepsis if:\n  \n\u2022 the patient has communication diffi  culties: limited English; limited verbal com-\nmunication; cognitive impairment\n  \n\u2022 the patient is immunosuppressed, on chemotherapy, or an IV drug user\n  \n\u2022 the patient recently had surgery or is pregnant/recently gave birth\n  \n\u2022 the patient has indwelling lines/other foreign material.\n\ue098 Sepsis recognition\nTable 19.3 Risk criteria in sepsis\n\ue098 Moderate- to high-risk criteria\nHigh-risk criteria\nReports of altered mental state or acute \ndeterioration in functional status\nObjective evidence of altered mental \nstate\nRespiratory rate (RR) 21\u201324\nRR>24; new requirement for FiO2 >40% \nto keep sats >92% (>88% in COPD)\nSystolic blood pressure (SBP) 91\u2013100mmHg\nSBP <90 or >40mmHg less than baseline\nHeart rate 91\u2013130bpm or new arrhythmia\nHeart rate >130bpm\nUrine output: nil for 12\u201318h; 0.5\u20131.0mL/kg/h \nif catheterized\nUrine output: nil for 18h; <0.5mL/kg/h if \ncatheterized\nLocal signs of infection, incl. redness, swell-\ning, or discharge around wound\nMottled, ashen, or cyanotic skin.
