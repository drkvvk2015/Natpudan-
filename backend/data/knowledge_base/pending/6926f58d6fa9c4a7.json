Both B \nand T cells are implicated.\nPresentation Slowly increasing or relapsing muscular fatigue. Muscle groups af-\nfected, in order: extra ocular; bulbar (swallowing, chew ing); face; neck; limb girdle; \ntrunk. Signs: Ptosis, diplopia, myasthenic snarl on smiling, \u2018peek sign\u2019 of orbicularis \nfatigability (eyelids begin to separate after manual opposition to sustained closure). \nOn counting to 50, the voice fades (dysphonia is a rare presentation). Tendon re\ufb02 exes \nare normal. Symptoms exacerbated by: Pregnancy, \ue001K\n+, infection, over-treatment, \nchange of climate, emotion, exercise, gentamicin, opiates, tetracycline, quinine, \n\ue020-blockers.\nDiff erentials Polymyositis/other myopathies (p510); SLE; Takayasu\u2019s arteritis (fati-\ngability of the extremities); botulism (see BOX).\nAssociations Include autoimmune disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis and \nSLE). If <50yrs, it is commoner in \ue033 and associated with thymic hyperplasia; >50, it \nis commoner in men, and associated with thymic atrophy or thymic tumour.\nTests \u2022 Antibodies: \ue000Anti-AChR antibodies in 90% (70% in MG variant con\ufb01 ned to \nocular muscles). If anti-AChR \u03a9ve look for MuSK antibodies (muscle-speci\ufb01 c tyrosine \nkinase; especially in \ue033). \u2022 EMG: Decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve \nstimulation \u00b1 \ue000single-\ufb01 bre jitter. \u2022 Imaging: CT to exclude thymoma (68% 5yr sur-\nvival). \u2022 Other: Ptosis improves by >2mm after ice application to the eyelid for \n>2min\u2014a neat, non-invasive test (but not diagnostic). The Tensilon\u00ae (edrophoni-\num) test may not give clear answers and has dangers, so is rarely used.\nTreatment \u2022 Symptom control: Anticholinesterase, eg pyridostigmine (60\u2013120mg \nPO up to 6\u2248daily; max 1.2g/d). Cholinergic SE: \ue000salivation, lacrimation, sweats, vom-\niting, miosis. Other SE: diarrhoea, colic (controllable with propan the line 15mg/8h). \n\u2022 Immunosuppression: Treat relapses with prednisolone\u2014start at 5mg on alter-\nnate days, \ue000 by 5mg/wk up to 1mg/kg on each treatment day. \ue001Dose on remis-\nsion (may take months). Give osteo porosis prophylaxis. SE: weakness (hence low \nstarting dose). Azathioprine, ciclosporin, and mycophenolate mofetil may also be \nused. \u2022 Thymectomy: Has bene\ufb01 cial eff ects, even in patients without a thymoma: \nconsider especially in younger patients with onset <5yrs previously and poor re-\nsponse to medical therapy. A recent randomized controlled trial shows improved \nsymptom scores sustained over 3yrs, with reduced need for immunosuppression. \nSurgery also prevents local invasion if thymoma is present.\nMyasthenic crisis Life-threatening weakness of respiratory muscles during a re-\nlapse. \ue007Can be diffi  cult to diff erentiate from cholinergic crisis (ie overtreatment\u2014\nbut this is rare, and usually only occurs in doses of pyridostigmine >960mg/d). \nMonitor forced vital capacity. Ventilatory support may be needed. Treat with \nplasmapheresis (removes AChR antibodies from the circulation) or IVIg and identify \nand treat the trigger for the relapse (eg infection, medications).\nLambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)\nLEMS can be paraneoplastic (50% are associated with malignancies, in particular \nsmall-cell lung cancer) or autoimmune. Unlike MG, antibodies are to voltage-gated \nCa\n2+ channels on pre-synaptic memb rane (see \ufb01 g 10.33; anti-P/Q type VGCC antibodies \nare +ve in 85\u201395%).\nClinical features \u2022Gait diffi  culty before eye signs. \u2022Autonomic involvement (dry \nmouth, constipation, impotence). \u2022Hypore\ufb02 exia and weakness, which improve after \nexercise. \u2022Dip l opia and respiratory muscle involvement are rare. \u2022EMG shows similar \nchanges to MG except amplitude increases greatly post-exercise.\nTreatment Pyridostigmine, 3,4-diaminopyridine or IVIg (get specialist help). \ue007Do \nregular CXR/high-resolution CT as symptoms may precede the cancer by >4yrs.", "text_length": 4071, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 520/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 519, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.070868", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.071585", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 3}
