Talk to the patient and witnesses and let them tell you as \nmuch as possible without prompting or leading. Ask:\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient lose awareness?\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient injure themselves?\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient move? Are they stiff  or \ufb02 oppy? (A tonic phase preceding clonic \njerking points towards epilepsy.)\n  \n\u2022 Is there incontinence? (More common in epilepsy, but can occur with syncope.)\n  \n\u2022 Does their complexion change? (Pale/cyanosis suggests epilepsy; very pale/\nwhite suggests syncope or arrhythmia.)\n  \n\u2022 Does the patient bite the side of their tongue? (Suggests epilepsy.)\n  \n\u2022 Are there associated symptoms eg palpitations, sweats, pallor, chest pain, dysp-\nnoea (see \ufb01 g 10.11)?\n  \n\u2022 How long does the attack last?\nBefore the attack:\n  \n\u2022 Is there any warning?\u2014Eg typical epileptic aura or cardiac pre-syncope.\n  \n\u2022 In what circumstances do attacks occur? (If watching TV, consider epilepsy).\n  \n\u2022 Can the patient prevent attacks?\nAfter the attack:\n  \n\u2022 How much does the patient remember about the attack?\n  \n\u2022 Is there muscle ache? (Suggests a tonic\u2013clonic seizure.)\n  \n\u2022 Is the patient confused or sleepy? (Suggests epilepsy.)\nBackground to attacks:\n  \n\u2022 When did they start?\n  \n\u2022 Are they getting more frequent?\n  \n\u2022 Is anyone else in the family getting them? Sudden arrhythmic death may leave \nno evidence at postmortem, or there may be hereditary cardiomyopathy (refer \nthose with a relative who has had a sudden unexplained death <40yrs old).\nFig 10.11 VT causing blackout in Brugada syndrome (p695).
