The most sensitive and speci\ufb01 c test is IV ergonovine; 50mcg at 5min \nintervals in a specialist lab until a +ve result or 400mcg is given. When positive, the symptoms and \ue000ST should \nbe present. Nitroglycerin rapidly reverses the eff ects of ergonovine if refractory spasm occurs.62\nFig \n15.12 Telangiectasia in \nOsler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu syndrome.\nReproduced from Cox and \nRoper, Clinical Skills, 2005, \nwith permission from Oxford \nUniversity Press.\nFig 15.15 TB of axis: soft tis-\nsue swelling displaces the \nretro pharyngeal \nair\u2013tissue \nboun dary forwards.

Coronary spasm \ncan be induced by ergonovine, acetylcholine, and methacholine (the former is used \ndiagnostically).\n5 These cause vasodilation by endothelium-derived nitric oxide \nwhen vascular endothelium is functioning normally, whereas they cause vasocon-\nstriction if the endothelium is damaged. In the light of these facts, patients with \ncoronary spasm are thought to have a disturbance in endothelial function as well \nas local hyperreactivity of the coronary arteries.\nIf full anti-anginal therapy does not reduce symptoms, stenting or intra coronary \nradiation (20Gy brachytherapy) to vasospastic segments may be tried. Prognosis \nis good (especially if non-smoker, no past MI, and no diabetes; progress to infarc-\ntion is quite rare);61 \ue020-blockers and large doses of aspirin are contraindicated.\nPrinzmetal angina is associated with vascular hyperreactivity/vasospastic dis-\norders such as Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and migraine. It is also associated with \ncircle of Willis occlusion from intimal thickening (moyamoya disease). \nPrinzmetal angina and vascular hyperreactivity", "text_length": 2926, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 717/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 716, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.402716", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.404091", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
