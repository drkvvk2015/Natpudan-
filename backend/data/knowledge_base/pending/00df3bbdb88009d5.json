Aspirate continuously and watch ECG. Frequent \nventricular ectopics or an injury pattern (\ue001ST segment) on ECG imply that the \nmyocardium has been breached\u2014withdraw slightly. As soon as \ufb02 uid is obtained \nthrough the needle, slide the cannula into place.\n  \n\u2022 Evacuate pericardial contents through the syringe and 3-way tap. Removal of \nonly a small amount of \ufb02 uid (eg 20mL) can produce marked clinical improve-\nment. If you are not sure whether the \ufb02 uid you are aspirating is pure blood (eg \non entering a ventricle), see if it clots (heavily bloodstained pericardial \ufb02 uid does \nnot clot), or measure its PCV (though this may be diffi  cult in the acute setting but \nsome blood gas analysers may give this).\n  \n\u2022 You can leave the cannula in situ temporarily, for repeated aspiration. If there is \nreaccumulation, insert a drain but peric ardiectomy may be needed.\n  \n\u2022 Send \ufb02 uid for microscopy and culture, as needed, including tests for TB.\nComplications: Laceration of ventricle or coronary artery (\u00b1 subsequent haemo-\npericardium); aspiration of ventricular blood; arrhythmias (ventricular \ufb01 brillation); \npneumothorax; puncture of aorta, oesophagus (\u00b1 mediastinitis), or peritoneum (\u00b1 \nperitonitis).\nEmergency needle pericardiocentesis\nFig 18.16 Methods of providing oxygen.\nFig 18.15 Emergency needle pericardiocentesis.", "text_length": 2258, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 781/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 780, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.528248", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.529088", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
