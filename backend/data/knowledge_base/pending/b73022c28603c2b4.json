Never \nconsider a patient in diffi  culties from a big residual volume to be too old, young, \nor disabled to learn. 5-yr-old children can learn the technique, and can have their \nlives transformed\u2014so motivation may be excellent. There may be fewer UTIs as \nthere is no residual urine\u2014and less re\ufb02 ux obstructive uropathy. Assessing suit-\nability entails testing sacral dermatomes: a \u2018numb bum\u2019 implies \ue001sensation of a \nfull bladder; higher sensory loss may mean catheterization will be painless. Get \nhelp from your continence adviser who will be in a position to teach the patient \nor carer that catheterizations must be gentle (the catheter is of a much smaller \ncalibre), particularly if sensation is lacking, and must number >4/d (\u2018always keep \nyour catheter with you; don\u2019t wait for an urge before catheterizing\u2019). See \ufb01 g 18.4.\nSelf-catheterization\nYou will be asked to check catheters that are not draining. Check the \ufb02 uid chart \nand the patient:\n  \n\u2022 Previously good output, now anuric: Blocked catheter until proven otherwise. \nWas the urine clear previously or bloodstained? Consider \ufb02 ushing the catheter: \nwith aseptic technique \ufb02 ush and withdraw 20mL of sterile 0.9% saline with a \nbladder syringe. This may get the \ufb02 ow going again. A 3-way catheter may be \nneeded if there is clot or debris retention. If it blocks again, replace it. Repeated \n\ufb02 ushes lead to infection.\n  \n\u2022  Slow decline in urine output over several hours: In a dehydrated/post-op pa-\ntient a \ufb02 uid challenge of 500mL STAT (250mL if cardiac comorbidity) may help, \ncome back and check the response in 30min. Check all other parameters (eg \npulse, BP, CVP) and increase rate of background IV \ufb02 uids if appropriate.\n\ue022Acute kidney injury (p298): if urine output has tailed off  and now stopped, the \ncause is often renal hypoperfusion (ie pre-renal failure), but consider other fac-\ntors, eg nephrotoxic drugs.\n  \n\u2022  Catheter is bypassing: A condom catheter may be more appropriate.\n  \n\u2022  Catheter has dislodged into the proximal (prostatic) urethra: Possible even \nif the balloon is fully in\ufb02 ated. Consider this if a \ufb02 ush enters but cannot be with-\ndrawn. If the patient still needs a catheter then replace it, consider a larger size.\n  \n\u2022 The catheter has perforated the lower urinary tract on insertion and is not \nlying in the bladder or urethra: \ue022If suspected, call the urologists immediately.\nRemember: urine output should be >400mL in 24h or >0.5mL/kg/h (see p576).\n\u2018The catheter is not draining\u2026\u2019\nWhen it is time to remove a catheter, the possibility of urinary retention must be \nconsidered. Remove the catheter \ufb01 rst thing one morning. If retention does occur, \ninsert a long-term catheter (eg silicone), consider an \ue025-blocker (p642), and arrange \nurology TWOC clinic follow-up. \nTrial without catheter (TWOC)\nFig 18.2 A size 14F latex Foley \ncatheter with the balloon inf-\nl ated via the topmost port of \nthe outer end (green).\n\u00a9 Dr Tom Turmezei (not to scale).\nFig 18.3 The external end of \na size 20F 3-way catheter.
