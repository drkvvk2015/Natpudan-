Is this wise?\n  \n\u2022 The test is not very accurate, and we cannot say that those having the test will \nlive longer\u2014even if they turn out to have prostate cancer. Most men with pros-\ntate cancer die from an unrelated cause.\n  \n\u2022 If the test is falsely positive, you may needlessly have more tests, eg prostate \nsampling via the back passage (causes bleeding and infection in 1\u20135% of men).\n  \n\u2022 Only one in three of those with a high PSA level will have cancer.\n  \n\u2022 You may be worried needlessly if later tests put you in the clear.\n  \n\u2022 If a cancer is found, there\u2019s no way to tell for sure if it will impinge on health. You \nmight end up having a bad eff ect from treatment that wasn\u2019t needed.\n  \n\u2022 There is much uncertainty on treating those who do turn out to have prostate \ncancer: options are radical surgery to remove the prostate (risks erectile dys-\nfunction and incontinence),  radiotherapy, or hormones.\n  \n\u2022 Screening via PSA has shown con\ufb02 icting results. Some RCTS have shown no dif-\nference in the rate of death from prostate cancer, others have found reduced \nmortality, eg 1 death prevented per 1055 men invited for screening (if 37 cancers \ndetected).\n\ue007Ultimately, you must decide for yourself what you want.\nAdvice to asymptomatic men asking for a PSA blood test \nA number of prognostic factors help determine if \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 or agg ressive \ntherapy should be advised: \u2022Pre-treatment PSA level. \u2022Tumour stage (as measured \nby the TNM system; p523). \u2022Tumour grade\u2014Gleason score. Gleason grading is from \n1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade, and carrying the poorest prognosis. Gleason \ngrades are decided by analysing histology from two separate areas of tumour \nspecimen, and adding them to get the total Gleason score for the tumour, from 2 \nto 10. Scores 8\u201310 suggest an aggressive tumour; 5\u20137: intermediate; 2\u20134: indolent. \nPrognostic factors in prostate cancer\nBalanitis Acute in\ufb02 ammation of the foreskin and glans. Associated with strep \nand staph infections. More common in diabetics. Often seen in young children with \ntight foreskins \ue057: Antibiotics, circumcision, hygiene advice.\nPhimosis The foreskin occludes the meatus. In young boys this causes recurrent \nbalanitis and ballooning, but time (+ trials of gentle retraction) may obviate the \nneed for circumcision. In adulthood presents with painful intercourse, infection, \nulceration, and is associated with balanitis xerotica obliterans.\nParaphimosis Occurs when a tight foreskin is retracted and becomes irreplace-\nable, preventing venous return leading to oedema and even ischaemia of the glans. \nCan occur if the foreskin is not replaced after catheterization. \ue022\ue057: Ask patient \nto squeeze glans. Try applying a 50% glucose-soaked swab (oedema may follow \nosmotic gradient). Ice packs and lidocaine gel may also help. May require aspira-\ntion/dorsal slit/circumcision.\nBenign diseases of the penis\nMay be acute or chronic. Usually those >35yrs. Acute prostatitis is caused mostly \nby S. faecalis and E. coli, also Chlamydia (and previously TB). Features: UTIs, reten-\ntion, pain, haematospermia, swollen/boggy prostate on DRE. \ue057: Analgesia; levo\ufb02 oxa-\ncin 500mg/24h PO for 28d. Chronic prostatitis may be bacterial or non-bacterial. \nSymptoms as for acute prostatitis, but present for >3 months. Non-bacterial chronic \nprostatitis does not respond to antibiotics. Anti-in\ufb02 ammatory drugs, \ue025\u2013blockers, \nand prostatic massage all have a place.\nProstatitis", "text_length": 3596, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 653/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 652, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.297600", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.298168", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
