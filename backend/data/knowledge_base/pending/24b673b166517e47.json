Causes: early acute oliguric renal failure (p298), chronic \nkidney disease (p302). In chronic kidney disease also \ue001Hb, \ue000PTH, and renal bone disease.\nTubular dysfunction: Results from damage to tubules. Diagnosis is made by test-\ning renal concentrating ability (p241). May be polyuric with \ue000urinary glucose, amino \nacids, proteins (lysozyme, \ue0202-microglobulin), or phosphate. Causes: recovery from \nacute kidney injury, hypercalcaemia, hyperuric aemia, myeloma, pyelonephritis, hy-\npokalaemia, Wilson\u2019s disease, galactosaemia, and heavy metal poisoning.\nTable 14.1 Biochemical pro\ufb01 le in abnormal kidney function\nLow GFR\nTubular dysfunction\nUrea & creatinine\n\ue000\nNormal\nK\n+ & urate\n\ue000\n\ue001\nH\n+\n\ue000\n\ue000\nHCO3\n\u03a9\n\ue001\n\ue001\nPO4\n3\u03a9\n\ue000\n\ue001\nCa\n2+\n\ue001\nNormal\nThiazide and loop diuretics \ue001Na\n+, \ue001K\n+, \ue000HCO 3\n\u03a9, \ue000 urea.\nBone disease See table 14.2 for typical biochemical patterns.\nTable 14.2 Serum biomarkers in common diseases of bone\nCa\n2+\nPO4\n3\u03a9\nALP\nOsteoporosis (p682)\nNormal\nNormal\nNormal\nOsteomalacia (p684)\n\ue001\n\ue001\n\ue000\nPaget\u2019s\nNormal\nNormal\n\ue000\ue000\nMyeloma\n\ue000\n\ue000, normal\nNormal\nBone metastases\n\ue000\n\ue000, normal\n\ue000\n1\u00b0 Hyperparathyroidism\n\ue000\n\ue001, normal\nNormal, \ue000\nHypoparathyroidism\n\ue001\n\ue000\nNormal\nRenal failure (low GFR)\n\ue001\n\ue000\nNormal, \ue000\nHepatocellular disease \ue000Bilirubin, \ue000\ue000AST, ALP \ue000 slightly, \ue001albumin.
