The diff erential of skin problems in travel-\nlers in outlined in \ufb01 g 9.54.\nScabies\nCaused by microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. \nFound worldwide, ~300 million cases/yr. Female \nmites burrow into the epidermis and deposit eggs. \nSymptoms due to an allergic reaction to the parasite. \nTransmission via direct and prolonged skin-to-skin \ncontact. Epidemics linked to poverty, overcrowding, \nand poor water supply. Presentation: Severe (noc-\nturnal) pruritus, papular/scaly rash, burrows may be \nvisible (\ufb01 g 9.55). Itch can lead to secondary bacterial \ninfection. Diagnosis: Clinical. Skin scraping for mite/\neggs/faeces. Treatment: Topical permethrin 5% or \nmalathion 0.5%. Ivermectin given for \ufb01 lariasis (p421) \nmay eff ectively treat concurrent scabies.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis\nMost common form of leishmaniasis. Esti-\nmated 0.7\u20131.3 million new cases/yr: Americas, \nMediterranean basin, north Africa, Middle \nEast, central Asia. Presentation: Lesions \ndevelop at the bite site, beg inning as an \nitchy papule; crusts fall off  to leave a pain-\nless ulcer with a well-de\ufb01 ned, raised border \nand a crusted base = \u2018Chiclero\u2019s ulcer\u2019 (\ufb01 g \n9.56). Diagnosis: Skin biopsy + PCR. Treat-\nment: Most heal in ~2\u201315 months with scar-\nring (dis\ufb01 guring if extensive). \u2018New World\u2018 \ndisease (South America) needs treating due \nto risk of mucocutaneous disease: pentava-\nlent antimony, eg meglumine antimoniate, \nsodium stibogluconate.
