It of-\nfers immediate but short-lived protection. Natural passive immunity occurs in the \nplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus; acquired passive immunity \nincludes treatment with immunoglobulin eg hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, varicella-\nzoster.\nActive immunity follows exposure to an antigen, which generates an adaptive im-\nmune response. Natural active immunity occurs following infection. Acquired active \nimmunity is provided by vaccination. Routine vaccinations in the UK are shown in \ntable 9.13. Additional vaccines are off ered to speci\ufb01 c vulnerable groups (table 9.14). \nImmunosuppression is a contraindication to live vaccines due to the risk of dis-\nseminated disease. Includes immunode\ufb01 ciency, immunosuppressive treatment, HIV. \nInactivated vaccines can be given but the antibody response may be less: aim to \ngive >2wks prior to immunosuppressive therapy when possible (or vaccinate whilst \non treatment and considered repeat re-immunization when/if treatment complete).\nTable 9.13 UK vaccination summary (*=live vaccine)\nVaccination\nAge (m=months, y=years)\n2m\n3m\n4m\n12m\n>2y\n3\u20135y\n12y \ue033\n14y\n>65y\n70y\nDiphtheria\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nTetanus\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nPertussis\n+\n+\n+\n+\nPoliomyelitis\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nHaemophilus \nin\ufb02 uenzae B (Hib)\n+\n+\n+\n+\nPneumococcal\n+\n+\n+\nRotavirus*\n+\n+\nMeningitis B\n+\n+\n+\nMeningitis C\n+\nMeasles, mumps, \nrubella*\n+\n+\nIn\ufb02 uenza\n+\n+\nHPV 6, 11, 16, 18\n+\nMeningitis ACWY\n+\nVaricella zoster*\n+\nTable 9.14  Additional vaccination of speci\ufb01 c groups in UK (*=live vaccine)\nVaccination \nOff ered to \nBCG*\nInfants/children where TB incidence >40/100 000 or parent/grand-\nparent born in country where incidence >40/100 000, TB contacts.\nHib\nHyposplenism, complement disorders.\nMeningitis B, ACWY\nHyposplenism, complement disorders.\nIn\ufb02 uenza\nHyposplenism, DM, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory \ndisease, CKD, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological disease, \nimmunosuppression, pregnancy.\nPneumococcal\nHyposplenism, cochlear implants, complement disorders, DM, \nchronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, CKD, chronic liver \ndisease, chronic neurological disease, immunosuppression.\nHepatitis A, B\nChronic liver disease, haemophilia, CKD (hepatitis B only).\nPertussis\nPregnancy 16\u201332 weeks (neonatal protection).\nTravel\nTravel advice (food/drink, insect repellent, malaria prophylaxis, condoms) is more \nimportant than vaccination.
