Invasive \nventilation for exacerbations of COPD may not be appropriate: it can be diffi  cult to \nwean patients off  ventilatory support, and brings with it the risk of ventilator-asso-\nciated pneumonias and pneumothoraces from ruptured bullae. If possible, speak to \nthe patient early, before deterioration, try to ascertain their wishes. Patients who \nhave previously been ventilated may not wish to repeat the experience. Consider \ncomorbidities, FEV1, functional status, whether the patient requires home oxygen, \nand whether the patient has previously been admitted to ICU (and if so, whether they \nwere easily weaned from invasive ventilation). Involve the patient, the family, your \nseniors, and ICU early in making a decision.\n  \n\u2022 The greatest danger is hypoxia, which probably accounts for more deaths than \nhypercapnia. Don\u2019t leave patients severely hypoxic.\n  \u2022 However, in some patients, who rely on their hypoxic drive to breathe, too much \noxygen may lead to a reduced respiratory rate and hypercapnia, with a consequent \nfall in conscious level. Always prescribe O2 as if it were a drug.\n  \n\u2022 Care is always required with O2, especially if there is evidence of CO2 retention. \nStart with 24\u201328% O2 in such patients.\n\ue022 Whenever you initiate or change oxygen therapy, do consider an ABG within 1h.\n  \n\u2022 Monitor the patient carefully. Aim to raise the PaO2 above 8.0kPa with a rise in \nPaCO2 <1.5kPa.\n  \n\u2022 In patients without evidence of retention at baseline use 28\u201340% O2, but still \nmonitor and repeat ABG.\nOxygen therapy", "text_length": 2795, "metadata": {"source": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf (Part 820/905)", "type": "chunk", "chunk_index": 819, "total_chunks": 905, "uploaded_by": "admin@admin.com", "upload_date": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.603709", "document_uuid": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f", "filename": "8205Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 10th 2017 Edition_SamanSarKo - Copy.pdf", "category": "medical_pdf", "section": "body", "year": 2017, "outdated": false, "document_id": "1c4b3c41-9a74-4d3d-ab11-d2a041c9641f"}, "created_at": "2025-12-11T17:59:53.604622", "status": "complete", "chunks_added": 2}
